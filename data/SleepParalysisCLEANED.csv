0,Identifying SP,Sleepparalysis,177,"I’m making this because 75% of this sub is people asking “was this SP”. And almost always the answer is yes. So I’m going to list the various effects and some helpful information about the effects. Sort of a master guide to “Do I have SP”


Edit: This is a list of potential Symptoms, if you only experience 2 or experience all you are most likely experiencing SP
Seeing and hearing things are far more rare than not. However its also boring hence why no one shares their story here or other places when not a lot happened. 


Edit: 0. Someone pointed out I didn’t include the obvious, Paralysis, feeling of being unable to move, like your limbs weigh a million pounds, like your being held down, like your moving but nothing is happening, pain in limbs you try to move. ETC... (This is where we get the name, the explanation is simple. Your whole body is asleep, except for your brain.) 


1. Chest pressure/ Feeling of being unable to breathe.
(While under the effects of an SP episode the nerves in your chest are dulled as they are under the impression you’re asleep. You are in fact still breathing.)

2. Hallucinations
(You’re brain is in dream mode, you’re having open eyed dreams)

3. Sounds (screaming, talking, music etc...)
(Again this is because of your dreams being active while awake)

4. Feelings of being touched, hurt, bit, scratched, flying, falling, shaking
(You’re nerves are all asleep, sometimes they’re in the process of waking up and can cause interesting feelings as they do. Alternatively you’re body may be simulating what your brain is dreaming about as we normally experience these while asleep)

5. Panic, anxiety, terror
(100% natural responses to being trapped.)

6. Feeling like time won’t pass or time is stuck
(You have no real way of perceiving time in this state)

7. Racing heart
(Anxiety)

8. Intense or vivid nightmares/dreams before or after
(The nightmare would be what woke you up into the SP, and if it comes after it’s because you’re anxiety is through the roof)

9. Feeling alone
(SP is not as rare as you think, lots of people never even know it happened as they attribute it to a weird dream, you’re not alone, there’s lots of us out here.)

Edit: 10. Recently discovered through this Sub, I had never heard of or experienced it but people report “Buzzing” “Humming” “Grinding” type noises preceding and episode.


Edit: 11. Also recently Discovered through the sub, spiraling, dizzy, sickly feelings. Occurring before during or after episodes.


Edit: 12. In the comments someone mentioned “feeling a presence.” To be clear, this is almost as Rare as actually seeing something. It does happen however and can be an eerie feeling. (Again your having an anxiety attack, our brains try to explain why we are panicking by blaming something. So it manifest a feeling of someone being out to get you, someone there to harm you, or maybe just someone in the room. Either or, nothing to be too scared of.)


There’s a slough of other things that can happen. But generally you can identify SP with three questions.
“Am I in my bed”
“Am I paralyzed”
“Am I unable to talk”

If the answer to these questions are yes then it’s textbook SP

Also remember that people are wildly different, and that your SP may be different but follow the same patterns as what you read. That’s normal, we all have differently wired brains, and no two cases will be exactly alike.


Sources: Myself, experienced SP for the past 16 years.

If anyone needs any advice or has any questions feel free to comment here and I’ll try my best to answer. SP doesn’t have to be as scary as it feel."
1,is it normal to experience sleep paralysis multiple times a night?,Sleepparalysis,19,"for background, ive missed a couple doses of my effexor and vyvanse which i’m going to assume is what caused this, along with the fact that i wasn’t gonna sleep well tonight anyway because i took a really long nap earlier in the day and the brain zaps from missing effexor are lowkey killing me.

i keep falling asleep, waking into sleep paralysis, snapping out of it, attempting to fall back asleep, and the cycle continues. every single time it terrifies me because before tonight i’ve never experienced ANYTHING like this. i’m pretty sure it’s SP i’m experiencing even though i’m not really seeing a “demon” like people are saying, i’m just feeling a bad presence in the room with me. the worst part is that i’m waking up into SP from nightmares that i’m having trouble distinguishing from reality. after about the fifth time i snapped out of SP i finally was able to get out of bed and here i am now. 

i desperately want to go back to sleep, but i’m terrified that the cycle i’ve been experiencing tonight will continue. is what i’m experiencing normal? can anyone please lend some helpful words? i’m having a really rough night"
2,oh no,Sleepparalysis,0,isn’t water just a snowman’s blood?? 🤯🤯🤔🤔
3,"Something that works for me with preventing SP, especially when you keep getting SP when trying to sleep",Sleepparalysis,1,"Not sure it will work for other people but it works 100% of the time for me. 

When you feel SP coming, try your best to break out of it, then get up, go to your kitchen, and drink a glass of water. When you get back to bed, it wont happen again.
I tried just walking around when i break out of an episode but when i go back to bed to try and go to sleep again,i get another round of SP. It only stops when i drink water for some reason"
4,The moment I fall asleep I wake up in a panic feeling like I can't breathe/ takes hours to fall asleep,Sleepparalysis,0,"This has only been happening for a few months. It started off where I would try to take naps during the day. It's like as soon as my body would fall asleep I would wake up in this panic and then be unable to fall asleep again. Therefore, unable to nap.
Now it has moved into nighttime sleep. As soon as I get comfortable and my body starts to fall asleep, all of a sudden I wake up feeling like my throat is closed unable to breathe for a few seconds, and with this panicky feeling. Sometimes it is just the breathing part, and sometimes it’s just the panicking part. Sometimes it's both. This happens several times over the course of a couple hours every night. 
It never happens after I've already been sleeping...its ALWAYS the moment I start to fall asleep. 
I have experienced actual sleep paralysis only as many times as I can count on one hand in my life. Terrifying. This… I’m not so sure of what it is. 
Sometimes, although rarely, I still get this weird feeling as soon as I’m falling asleep where I hear the most obnoxious loud sound in my ear. It’s like the loudest alarm clock ever, or somebody screaming bloody murder, or like a tea kettle whistling… and then I wake up and obviously there’s no sound. But that is very rare.
I had a baby 18 months ago and I thought the whole waking up while trying to nap panic feeling was just new mom anxiety… But it’s only getting worse and it has nothing to do with my feelings towards sleeping while my daughter is in bed. And now it has moved into my nighttime sleep. Every night.
Does anybody know what this is? I’m not depressed, I have very mild anxiety that I do not treat with medication, the only thing I can think of recently is that I’ve been getting really bad headaches from occipital neuralgia… They did put me on gabapentin but I’m only on 100 mg a day and I’ve only been on it for a week. Other than that, I have no idea what’s happening and I’m absolutely exhausted and really need help."
5,NSFW: My sleep paralysis experiences with rape and disturbing hallucinations. I’m experiencing this almost every night.,Sleepparalysis,38,"Hi guys, I just found this sub and I’m honestly really relieved that other people out there are experiencing the same thing as me. I was starting to feel crazy. I’m a 22F, and I’ve been experiencing sleep paralysis more and more frequently, to where I’m experiencing it almost every night. Here are my experiences. 

1) I first had sleep paralysis when I was 16. I woke up in my bed and couldn’t move, which seemed to go on for several minutes and was very distressing, but I was eventually able to wake myself up. 

2) My next sleep paralysis experience was definitely the most bizarre and happened when I was 18. I woke up in my bed paralyzed and a 7 foot tall humanoid figure with grey tree bark skin and no face stood at the foot of my bed. It started to grope me and I felt like I was being sexually assaulted. It raped me, it felt exactly like a real sexual encounter. This is TMI but I actually had an orgasm. After googling this experience, I found the concept of succubi/incubi, and that scientists attribute these experiences to sleep paralysis. 

3) After that weird experience, I probably only had sleep paralysis a handful of times over 3 years, and I was always able to wake myself and didn’t see/hear anything distressing. But recently things have gotten really bad. 

4) For the past 3 weeks, almost every night, I have had sleep paralysis. Sometimes multiple times in the same night, where I have to wake myself up and then go back to sleep again. It has made me afraid of falling asleep. Some of my experiences are, feeling like I am being pulled from my bed, a feeling of falling, feeling a “ghost” in my bed pulling my sheets and touching me, feeling aroused by a “ghost” touching me, hearing voices speaking gibberish. 

5) Last night was the worst. I woke up in my bed, and my mom was kneeling beside my bed staring at me. I live with my mom, and sometimes she will come in my room in the morning to tell me about news or something. So I assumed it must be morning, and my mom had come to tell me something. But then my “mom” starting speaking gibberish and in my other ear I started hearing a really deep man’s voice also saying nonsense words. I realized this was sleep paralysis, and willed myself to make my fingers move and wake myself up, all the while hearing these scary voices. It was just awful. 

I’m scared to go to sleep now. I don’t what to do. Part of me wants to be like, is there a way I can reframe the experience to make it seem interesting instead of scary? But it’s really difficult because every experience feels evil. I don’t know why all of a sudden this has been happening so frequently. 

For context, my dad and his mother both have a sleep condition called REM sleep behavior disorder where they aren’t paralyzed during REM sleep and act out their dreams by yelling, talking, kicking, punching etc. When I was a little kid I would kick in my sleep too and I needed a side railing so I wouldn’t fall out of bed, but I grew out of that. I’m just mentioning because I don’t know if this family history could be related, since I know sleep paralysis is also a disturbance in REM sleep. The only other weird sleep thing I do is that occasionally I will wake up with my head at the foot of the bed, opposite to how I fell asleep. 

Thank you for reading this far, it’s a relief to be able to talk about this. Please share if you have had similar experiences and any advice you might have."
6,My first SP experience,Sleepparalysis,0,"It happens more than 10 yrs ago when i was in highschool.
At that time i was finally able to sleep without any lights turns on, the AC was set very low, so i cover myself entirely. I held my blanket with my two hands up until it parallel with my forehead. it didn't take me too long to dream, i guess i was too tired that day. 

i remember it was started from a very vivid and strange dream: 
i dreamt that I sleep on the upper bed of a two story bed (not a bunk-bed) when i rolled out of bed and fall onto someone that sleep on the lower bed. at that second instead of feeling something is sleeping under me, i felt something sliding onto my back through my back spine (i still on my hands up-pose) and it woke me up. i could just move my eyes, they're not cover by the blanket, looking around the dark room i tried to comprehend what was happening. i wasn't aware yet that i couldn't move my body, but i was afraid of what was that that slides onto my back, was it still there? i was scared to even checked what it was. so, i decided to just get up. and that is when i realized that i have been paralized. can't move anything not even my toes. i think i stayed like that for 5-10 minutes. i had cold sweat, my heart racing as i breath fast. i closed my eyes, like so tight. i don't know if it was to get back to sleep again or tried to wake my dreaming-self. when it didn't work, i tried to wiggle my toes (yes i already knew stories from my friend the tips but i didn't know what it was yet, not like now) and it still didn't work. finally, as my last attempt i prayed. yes. i recited every scriptures that i remember on my head.

it worked. i woke up, with sweats (remember the AC is set so cold). so, i quickly get up, turned on the light, and got out of my bedroom and found my family member that still haven't slept so that i know that i'm back to reality."
7,Sleepparalysis hallutionations talking?,Sleepparalysis,10,"I recently had sleepparalysis again. Normally, I only feel like I'm pinned down and can't breath (normal SP stuff you know). I can 'feel' a presence in my room, holding me down, maybe moving my hair from my face or trailing its fingers down my face and sitting on my bed behind me while keeping me from moving and crushing me into my matras.
But the last time, that Thing suddenly stopped. I heard it say ""good afternoon"" and it opened the door and left. The door was still closed when I finally dared to check, but it was the first time I heard it speak. 
Has anyone else heard their SP-hallutionation speak to them?"
8,My SP elevated,Sleepparalysis,2,"So I have been dealing with sleep paralysis for years. My typical SP experience is high pitched ringing, vibrations, and maybe a dark figure occasionally. But tonight I was starting to fall asleep and my hall light began to flicker and I went into SP mode. I was fighting it and started to have more intense vibrations/ringing and felt like I was actually levitating/floating. Keep in mind the hall light is flickering in all of this and is making me panic. I felt like this lasted more than my typical SP episodes and all of the vibrations were more intense. Has anyone else ever had something similar? Kind of scared because this isn’t my typical SP."
9,falling into sp?,Sleepparalysis,1,"once in a while instead of waking up paralyzed, I'll be attempting to fall asleep and then, still awake, I'll find myself paralyzed. is this still sleep paralysis? i still experience chest pressure and hallucinations during this, the same as when i wake up in sleep paralysis."
10,Sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,0,I was having a dream as usual and then suddenly I was awake and then not really awake? I started hallucinating and then it felt like someone was tapping on my teeth really fast and it feels like my whole body is about to shut down and I can’t move no matter how hard I try to. Then it stops and I feel completely normal? It isn’t my weirdest sleep experience but is it just a weird form of sleep paralysis?
11,First Encounter,Sleepparalysis,1,"Hi, long time snooper but first-time poster here! Apologies if it's a little messy, I had my first SP experience two nights ago, and I haven't thought about anything since so I thought I would share.

A little background to my situation: I was pretty stressed the night before trying to complete a presentation, I had a tonne of sugar that day which then resulted in me feeling super ill and stressed out when I went to bed. My sleeping schedule is currently non-existent as my partner has been getting up for work around 5am for the past few weeks. I have occasionally been spending the night there, whilst also staying up however long I can be bothered staring at a screen doing work. After they left for work that morning, I stayed up for a while, scrolling through twitter, not really aiming to go back to sleep. Still, I seemingly drifted off on my back, which is so incredibly unusual for me.

I woke up (or so I thought) to a presence behind the bedroom door, my first instinct was that it was my partner returning from work; however, I dismissed that theory as I knew I couldn't have slept in that long. I noticed a great weight bearing down on my chest and managed to open my eyes although I couldn't move my head, so all I saw was the skin of whatever was on top of me. I then came to the conclusion that it was, in fact, my partner and they had sneaked in to try and scare me when I woke up, although they didn't talk they only groaned. I wanted to tell them ""I can't wake up"", but I could only move the tip of my tongue, this is when I realised I couldn't move the rest of my body.

My flatmate experiences SP quite regularly so I'm relatively familiar with the symptoms and was luckily able to identify what was happening. I can be quite volatile at the minute, so I was very thankful I was able to remain calm. Once I became aware that it was SP, my partner disappeared, however, I still felt the pressure on my chest and a slight sense of dread. Also, an eerie atmosphere was now present. I looked around the room, and it was a carbon copy of the room I was in beside the lighting was a little different. There was writing on the curtains, I could only make out the word ""springing"". At this point, I was able to move my head, the more I moved, the freer I became so I began to work on my right arm to reach my phone that was under my pillow. When I lifted it up in front of my face, there was a glitchy censorship over my hand, so I had nothing beyond my wrist. Adamant my phone was in my hand, I activated Siri by holding down the lock button and tried to call my partner. This was before ultimately giving up because I couldn't speak coherently. At this point, I was so very aware of what was going on and tried to fight it. I managed to lean over the side of the bed, figuring I'd deal with walking once I got to the floor. However, when I looked over, there was a door open ajar on the floor as if the rules of gravity didn't apply. I decided there was no chance was going to attempt that so I just rolled back over. I can't remember exactly if the phone or the door thing happened first, but after this point, I came to and seen my phone was actually on the floor charging.

I didn't really hear anything that I could notice, mostly just my own moaning trying to talk. Since it happened I have became hyper fixated on reading other people's experiences and learning more about it. I can't help but think if I had actually somehow managed to call my partner, very thankful I didn't work that one out!"
12,Someone Help me figure out what’s going on,Sleepparalysis,3,"For the past few years I have been experiencing sleep paralysis at least 1-3 times every week, however the last few months I have been experiencing it daily, sometimes I have it 1-3 times a night. I sleep with my dog now out of fear. Is there anything I can do to make it stop?"
13,The Times I Have Experienced Sleep Paralysis So Far,Sleepparalysis,0,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalright I have quite a few stories here so enjoy!

1.) This was a while ago, I can't remember when. My family and I were driving home from and it was around 12 am when we got back. I had been sleeping in the car in the uncomfortable way (almost everyone has most likely experienced at least once in their life) and then I was finally in my room. I went to sleep and I thought that the next time I'd  wake up was in the morning. Well I woke up maybe around 2:30ish (I didn't look at a clock until after the incident) to see one of my stuffed rabbits sitting up right. It was propped up against the blanket cuz my legs were bent. It was like I was crab crawling, but it was just my legs that were bent. I also heard intense deep whispers, felt weight (which I thought were hands) on both of my shoulders, and felt waves of a tingling sensation from my feet to my shoulders. I thought that this was my dad pranking me. I thought Ha Ha, you got me dad, and I went to tell him to let him know that he could stop........I couldn't talk. I tried and tried the tingling sensation growing when I tried to move, and it was also really weird because I felt like my mouth was wide open. This was when I realized that this wasn't a prank and I became terrified. I saw something fly up out of the corner of my right eye (like f someone shot a rubber band towards the ceiling. Eventually I regained my ability to move and went downstairs. I checked the time. 2:44 am. I did not know how long I was like that for, but at that point I just wanted to get my mind off of it.

2.) The next time it happened was when I was in the car with my family. We were heading home and I slept all throughout the trip. Then my family stopped for something that I cannot remember. I was chilling, my Rick hat semi-covering my eyes when it started. I just had the tingling sensation every time I tried to move. I could SEE my sister RIGHT NEXT TO ME. I tried to get her attention the only way I could. Breathing heavily. Didn't work. It stopped and I turned to her and said ""Yo I was just in sleep paralysis, how did you not notice?"" She just shrugged.

3.) I had a couple of occurrences while I was video chatting with my boyfriend, I can't remember how many times it's happened though. I mainly remember trying to open my eyes to see him, but I was at an angle every time where I could not see him. His voice soothed me throughout the experience and then I was able to move again. From that point on, if we we are ever on call and he hears me inhale and exhale deeply three times, he knows that I'm going through sleep paralysis and tries his best to comfort me. Some of the times I was going through it, my mouth felt like it was open, so my boyfriend and I named the demon who was holding my mouth open ""Bubbers."" Edit: I tried to move to look up and sometimes I thought I was actually moving a limb, but when I ""stopped moving,"" I realized I hadn't moved at all.

4.) So this one was a weird one. I woke up. One look around and I knew I wasn't awake because my room layout was different. Last time I checked I had a room to myself and DIDN'T have a bunk bed. So I told myself that I was gonna wake up. So I did. Not. This room looked more similar except my bed was split in half. This time I was going to wake up. I could feel my eyelids opening, I could see my room, and the other room at the same time. All while I was having that familiar tingling sensation.

5.) I'm not sure what happened in this experience(?). I saw myself out of bed, a black tall figure in one of my windows. I was trying to walk away from it, but I felt so heavy and I could feel the tingling sensation from sleep paralysis, but I.....was.....walking? Well when I got near the door I started to curl up into myself. It just didn't make sense. I don't know if I was having a nightmare or if it was actually sleep paralysis.

6.) This is the most recent one, four days ago. I fell into sleep paralysis, the tingling, and this time, I could hear my boyfriend saying something to me, but I couldn't understand what he was saying. We were not on call as the wifi cut off in my house at 1 am and it was past that. Nothing else happened and I eased out of it.........into ANOTHER ONE. This time it was much more worse for me. Tingles and this time, I opened my eyes to see (don't laugh) the familiar blocky figure of Herobrine. He was on the opposite side of the bed where I was laying.  I was do freaking horrified. Mainly because it seemed like a figure was there and was going to hurt me. I tried to close my eyes and calm myself down to ease myself out of it. My eyes opened again and to my utter horror, the figure was closer, looming from the opposite side of the bed still, but looking into his white square eyes......I so desperately wanted to scream, but of course.....I couldn't. I just closed my eyes and finally freed myself. I waited for a few minutes and the went to sleep the rest of the night.

So those are my stories so far, if I have any other experiences I'll be sure to write them down here. Also, can anyone tell me if numbers 4 and 5 were actual SP experiences?"
14,SP where you can move ‘out of body’,Sleepparalysis,1,"I’ve had this on and off for years now, but I’ve never had a situation where I’m just laying there completely paralysed unable to move. Usually I get the sense of fear and some kind of entity will enter the room, trying to grab me and turn me over and ticking me etc. (I sleep on my stomach). When this happens I usually fight it out of body, and we end up on the bedroom floor wrestling while I’m smashing it’s face in. I then wake up eventually in my normal position. 
Is this still sleep paralysis? Or just a basic nightmare?"
15,I think I may have just had a sleep paralysis and it was terrifying.,Sleepparalysis,7,It’s currently 8:57 and this took place probably about 6 minutes ago. I was having a dream and this person was surrounding me and then I felt a strong pressure of someone pulling my arm off my bed. It really felt like someone was pulling me. And then I felt something on my back. I think I may have tried to say something but I don’t know if I did or not. It was absolutely horrible. My eyes were shut and I couldn’t move. It probably lasted maybe about 10 seconds or something.
16,I had very weird sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,"1st Time i had it, i opened my eyes and i could move but, my movements were very hard and i could see the light outside the window but no sounds. I think it was like 6 in the morning when i had it, after i moved i could hear weird growls. I closed my eyes and pretended to sleep, after that i could feel like i'm being dragged down, after it stopped i woke up. Second time happened a week ago, it was middle of the night and i could move but this time i felt like someone is watching me. I had my eyes closed and i could feel like someone is hitting me in the legs. Before that i had a very weird and realistic dream where i passed by one passage and then darkness. After i woke up paralysis began and i couldn't hear anything outside. On the end of paralysis i could feel like something is letting me away and i could now hear the outside sounds. (Sorry for bad grammar i tried to explain it best). Also after second paralysis i had my eyes closed for 3 more minutes because i didn't know did it ended or not."
17,just experienced sp for the first time,Sleepparalysis,0,"i woke up at 06:20. it's currently 07:18.

right before, i had a dream about my classmates from vocational school leaving the classroom. i was lowkey aware of being in a dream but then i was like ""hmm. what if i forced myself to lucid dream a little."" then i got nervous because i remembered an animator on youtube who made a video on how lucid dreaming led into sleep paralysis for him, so i attempted to wake myself up immediately. ironic.

i fell asleep on my stomach and was facing a wall, but i felt like if i could move and look behind me, there might have been someone/something there. i tried moving, and when i 'moved' too much i heard an intense ripping sound (like my soul was being ripped out of my body rather than my physical body moving?). it was hard to breathe—it felt like i was breathing through a really thick face mask. at one point i thought i heard myself call out but i don't think i did.

i find it a little funny that i got out of it by thinking about my current hyperfixation.

i only knew what it was and how to leave it kind of immediately because i used to read a lot about sleep paralysis. it was scary. i hope it doesn't happen again but it probably will."
18,Defying the laws of physics - sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,5,"Happened about 8 years ago but I still remember it vividly. Never had a similar experience ever since.

For context, my bed is placed right next to a wall and I was pretty athletic and strong.

Was around 2 or 3 am at night, I had finally decided to put the phone down and shut my eyes to try and sleep.

I assumed the Dracula sleeping position because idk, it's just comfortable at times.

I try to sleep for a bit, emptying my mind but insomnia and gadget addiction is a hell of a drug. The urge to check my phone overpowers me, so I open my eyes and reach to grab my phone.

But I can't move my arms, i cant even lift them off my chest. I felt no pressure or anything of the sort, it was as if I had lost the use of my arms.

I could see perfectly fine and I remember nothing in my room was out of place, the only slightly odd thing was that the moonlight felt more bright than usual on that night.

Freaked me the fuck out so I immediately tried to sit up but again I couldn't. I retained movement and control over my legs, neck and head but I couldn't get up, it felt like my upper back was just affixed to the bed.

Growing more scared and desperate, I swiveled my lower body to face the wall and attempt to push myself off the bed by bracing my feet agaisnt the wall.

Nothing.

I felt my body digging into the bed from the force of my legs but it just would not budge. My upper torso stayed stationary.

I applied more pressure and even heavily kicked the wall but to no avail, my body was still stuck to the same spot.

It is pretty painful kicking a brick wall with your bare feet so I quickly stopped after a while and attempted to instead launch myself off the bed by lifting my legs up and smashing my heels into the mattress in hopes that the return force from the mattress springs would launch me up.

Still nothing. (FYI, that bed is super bouncy and thick)

At this point, I'm so thoroughly terrified and traumatised by this abnormality in the law of physics that my teeth legit start chattering involuntarily.

I finally stopped moving and just shut my eyes and began reciting the lord's prayer out loud while mentally praying for god to let me move again.

The whole time I'm doing this, I'm tensing my arm muscles that wont move and after reciting the prayer twice, I finally calmed down enough to relax my muscles and tested moving my fingers hands, wrists, arms and upper back.

Finally, success!

Probably cause I was mentally exhausted by the whole ordeal, I remember just turning on my side, questioning reality and then falling asleep.

I'm inclined to believe that this wasnt a dream because I remember it so well to the point that I can still remember what the thumping noise of my feet agaisnt the wall sounded like.

So, was I tripping? Had a ghost on my chest? Experiencing sleep paralysis?

Oh, and anyone ever had a similar experience?"
19,Does anyone else experience this?,Sleepparalysis,0,"  

It is currently 4:56am and I have just woken up for the third time since I “attempted” to sleep at 11ishpm. Since I shook myself awake and was hungry, I decided before I forget to finally write down something I have noticed about my dreams/nightmares.

I tend to experience not only lucid dreaming, but sleep paralysis more often than I would like. I know it has a lot to do with my awful sleep patterns and how I fall asleep sometimes, which would be sitting up while watching tv.

While I’m lucid dreaming and realizing this is all of a dream I try my best to take advantage of this, but it usually will end up turning into a paralyzing nightmare (or tries to) and what I find the most interesting is that I seem to know when it’s going to happen. It is not that I am deciding for it to happen, but just know that my wonderful or only plain normal dream is about to become terrifying. 

Two things happen.

1.) If everything is clear, like it is daytime and I can see people and things around me normally, it will all suddenly become much darker, almost like you were outside during dusk. 

2.) If I am looking at a person in my dream (which I was this time) and their face goes from normal to demonic looking.

\- Also, just an extra, but not all the time, I hear horror style organ piano music (I know this all sounds like a vintage horror film).

Once I realize all of this happens, I shake myself awake. Through the years I have really mastered escaping the grips of a sleep paralysis monster. 

QUESTION: 

Does anyone else seem to know when a good lucid dream is about to turn into a nightmare, like signs? I feel like I am pretty fortunate to have these warning signs because there have been times where my sleep paralysis was so awful that I started choking/coughing (drowning dream) on my own built up spit.

Also, why is my subconscious warning me?

Sorry if this is all over the place, but I needed to get it all out now before I forget. 

Thank you!"
20,BF hearing voices,Sleepparalysis,2,"So my boyfriend just shared with me his experience last night. Where he was trying to go to sleep but suddenly had the feeling of his whole body being electrocuted, and he couldn't move. Whilst he couldn't move, he began to hear voices, a lot of voices he described it as being at a dinner party. He says he couldn't distinguish what the voices were saying, or if the voices were male or female. He just said that there was a lot of them. So my first thought while hearing this was that maybe it was a form of sleep paralysis. But he swears that he was trying to go to sleep and couldn't. That's when it happened. and I've only heard people who've had sleep paralysis as not being able to move, but only seeing things in their room, like shadowy figures, not hearing things. Please reach out if anyone has any similar experiences or an explanation!"
21,Any way to stop SP?,Sleepparalysis,28,"I am not getting much sleep and feel terrible during the day. I’m afraid to go to sleep.

Edit: Thanks everybody for the suggestions + info. I really appreciate it and will try out some of your tips tonight."
22,SP ?,Sleepparalysis,2,"Last night I experienced what I think may have been sleep paralysis but I am not sure.

It started by me watching the room where I slept as if it was a theater stage. I couldn’t see myself in bed as the side that was visible to me was the one my bf slept on. I then “woke up” and somehow I was above myself. I was looking at my sleeping body as if from a hovering perspective and this freaked myself out so much that I somehow landed back in my body in what I’m assuming was another false awakening. Because I thought I was awake and was scared I tried to call out my boyfriends name but no sounds came out of my mouth. It was like trying to scream under water. I then tried to shake his arm and kick his leg but it felt as if I had no strength. Again it felt like throwing punches underwater. After what felt like a couple minutes of doing this I woke up, like actually woke up this time. My boyfriend was still sound asleep so I know I hadn’t made any noises or actually moved. 

It was so weird and felt so real. Was it maybe a lucid dream or SP?"
23,This wasn't Sleep Paralysis. Please tell me differently [Serious],Sleepparalysis,10,"I fell to sleep belly down, diagonally on my bed with my cloths still on. My bedroom light and lamp were turned on too.

I was woken up. I had 2 pillows propped behind my head. The back of my head was cramped up against the headboard. My chin was touching my chest. They opened my eyes (I didn't open them). My pupils were staring directly and my chest and I couldn't move them. My body was positioned on the edge of my bed, feet touching the edge, shoulder 8 inches from the edge. They closest \*one\* was playing with my wrist, turning my hand around. He gently placed my hand on the bed and said ""We do not know what's wrong with him."" There were 2 other huddled up close behind him. They closed my eyes and backed me out.

I think I was put into this \*exact position\* so I wouldn't see their heads. They were not human, but their intention was not to scare me. I didn't feel fear or scared at all. They had bare arms, orange skin, no finger nails, no hand veins, no hand bone lines, no hair on their skin. Their arms were close to 1 thickness from wrist to bicep. No skin pigment changes anywhere.

I could see my full bedroom perfectly. The collar of the shirt I fell to sleep in. My gray hoodie. The sheet pulled down to my stomach. My feet point up under my blanket. I could see my bedside table perfectly in my peripheral, the objects on it. I could see my closet door opened, how I left it, and all the shirts in my closet. The memory is a perfect waking vision of my room and the things in it.

After being blacked-out again, i had a slight dream and woke up. I thought ""my wrist doesn't bend like that"" and then, it turns out it does - I can point my finger tips well past my shoulder with the palm of my hand facing down. When I woke up my pillows were normal, and I was sleeping on my side normally. I put myself in the exact same position as that waking memory. Chin down, pupils pointing at my chest, and tried to open my eyes - I couldn't see past my top eyelids - perfectly matching up with my waking memory too.

Please tell me this was \*Sleep Paralysis\*. I really, really, really don't want to be a crazy person.

.

TL;DR - Got put in a weird position, woken up by caring, benevolent space doctors. I didn't feel fear in the moment. I just thought ""well this is fucking weird"" before being put under again."
24,False awakenings accompanied by sleep paralysis symptoms,Sleepparalysis,0,"Something very strange has been happening to me. First of all, I shouldn't be able to have dreams while taking naps (they range from 10 to 30 minutes max), but I do. I always had dreams during the day, in short periods of time, which isn't normal, according to what I've read about sleep. This is a symptom of narcolepsy, but I don't have any other symptoms other than this one, therefore I don't believe I'm a narcoleptic. Can this be explained in any other way? 

In any case... Twice this week I've had a sequence of lucid dreams, in which I ""fall asleep"" and ""wake up"" multiple times, in different layers of the dream. At times I believe that I am in real life, but the hallucinations and restrictions of movement and speech that are characteristic symptoms of sleep paralysis convince me that I'm dreaming. I always ""wake up"" in my bed. I am unable to move or scream. I know that I'm dreaming, and I consciously try to wake up, avoid scary hallucinations by focusing on random ones, or fall asleep again. This never happens at night, and I'm able to sleep properly. 

I've never tried to have lucid dreams before, and I don't have much control over them, although I can control my actions.

Some of the things I've seen are: My mother, in a vampire-like form, a small possum trapped below my arm, and a projection of a couple in cartoonish monkey outfits, kissing. I've also heard something breathing through the wall. That was particularly scary. I always calm down when I realise that it's not real, though.

What do you guys think? Should I be worried? I don't think it's a real sleep paralysis, but I've had those before and I can tell it's very similar. Even the heaviness and the silent despair... I hope this isn't too off topic."
25,What do you feel/experience before SP?,Sleepparalysis,9,"I can always tell when it's going to happen. I get this weird feeling in my brain, sort of like an electric feeling, like getting small electric shocks and feeling really dizzy. After that, my limbs start to feel very heavy, and at this point, I usually try to move a lot so it wouldn't happen. I get SPs when trying to fall asleep.

I get them very often, pretty much every night. It's a wonder if it doesn't happen. Have you noticed any ways to prevent it from happening? I'm starting to feel very frustrated after experiencing them for years. Even though they're a part of my everyday life, I still get very anxious and scared every time it happens and I often have trouble falling asleep."
26,Paralyzed speaking.,Sleepparalysis,11,"Every time I experience sleep paralysis I am able to kind of yell in a very weird paralyzed voice to my husband to wake me up.  Usually I try saying his name or saying help.  I am always terrified and know it’s coming on and try to beg for help.  Someone recently told me I was astral projecting,  but I’m not sure?  It’s usually right when I fall asleep,  I can see the entire room around me,  I cannot move or speak but I’m always feeling completely fearful.  I’m usually so very comfortable in bed.  I don’t get it?  Happens often.  Any thoughts?"
27,Worst SP Experience To Date,Sleepparalysis,1,"Couple of things to note before I begin is that I have had SP experiences since I was a kid and continue to get it avg 2 times a month, also I can safely say I have experienced most scary things that happen during SP which leads me to this morning or about 30 mins ago... 


This morning I had a good 5 hours sleep before waking up at round 5:30 am, I stayed on my phone watching some YouTube with my AirPods in. Then around 7 I realised I would like to get some more sleep before I have to get out of bed, so I put on my sleep mask and a comedy special to fall back asleep with my head facing the ceiling.

As soon as I fall asleep I am put into and extreme amount of pressure (more than I have experienced before) during SP and I am having difficulty breathing during this I was wheezing really bad and thought I was gonna die due to lack of oxygen, I believe I almost ran out of breath which woke me up. 

Not too long after that I couldn’t help it but fell back asleep this time Instantly upon SP i feel a sharp pain near my hip which lasts the whole experience, I feel immense pressure and wheezing can’t breathe. Even though I had my sleep mask on i swear I could see a picture of my family on the roof bc I have always thought you see your family before you pass away. Not being able to comfortably breathe I could feel my body leaning back and all I could think of was “am I going to die”, “is this what happens before you die”, “I’m not ready to die yet I’m too young”. 

I truly believe that what started out as a fun experience during sleep paralysis is starting to take a nasty more serious turn and I can’t help myself from thinking is this the way I’m going to die.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far :)"
28,I Think I Experienced Sleep Paralysis This Morning (?),Sleepparalysis,0,"Hi... I don't post to reddit very often, but something happened this morning and it's got me all dazed, so was hoping to find out if I really did experience sleep paralysis or just a weird nightmare.

I went to bed around 11:30pm, but woke up at 4:15am. I went back to bed but awake again at 6:30am since I take a family member to work. I got back home around 7:30am and was exhausted (I'd gone to the gym yesterday and put it down to that) so I went back to bed to get an extra 40-50 minutes rest before I had to get ready for work.

I went to sleep totally fine, and my alarms started to go off at 8:10am as planned. It's Alexa so I was able to turn her off with my voice, and I opened my eyes to look at the clock. I decided for an extra 5 minutes (typically) but then I seemingly opened my eyes again and the clock read 15:23 and the display seemed broken. I got up from bed in a panic screaming about how I'm late for work and someone's gonna yell at me, but I needed to feed my fish. I got half dressed and opened the tank lid, but there was a huuuuuge eel like fish in the tank with my tiny fishies. It obviously didn't fit in the tank and was squirming. But I wasn't phased for some reason? I then went to open another tank lid, and that's when it hit me - I was still asleep. I only have one tank in my room so I looked at the clock and it read 8:25am.

My brain was like ""oh we should get up! It's time to get dressed!"" and the visions stopped and I saw myself in my bed. But I couldn't move and about 10 seconds later I was back at the fish tanks. There were now 3 tanks, and these monster fish were jumping out since the tanks were faaaar too small for them and I kept catching them and putting them back in. I was speaking to them, telling them ""get back in there now, it'll be fine, I know it's too small, who put you in these tanks?"" (I have no idea if I said these things out loud).

I heard so much background noise -  some sort of radio, someone playing Mario Kart but it was a little distorted, people yelling outside, my phone going off. I just focused on the fish really...

They were splashing and pushing water everywhere and trying to bite me, but I didn't get wet or hurt. I saw this smaller fish and it... floated. It was floating around the outside of the tank, so I grabbed it by the tail fin and turned it to face me. I said ""oh are you a piranha? I best not put you with the other fish, you can stay with me."" And it opened it's mouth - thin and very sharp teeth pulsated in and out of it's gums and it had dead eyes.

That scared me enough to come back out of the vision, and look at the clock. It said 8:40am and I'd had enough, and somehow was able to relax and pull myself together and get out of bed. 

I made it to work 15 minutes late, but honestly all I remember this morning is driving my family member to work and then that strange living nightmare.

This sometimes happens at least 3 times a week, where I'll have a surreal and strange dream so vivid that I'll think I'm already awake. And then when I actually do wake up, I'm dazed and confused for a good few hours. 

I originally put it down to only my antidepressants, but I don't know if it's something more?

Do tell me if this post isn't suitable for this subreddit. It feels good to get it out into words though, so thanks for listening if you did read it...


TL;DR - Went to have a 40 minute nap, ended up having a frightening nightmare about demonic fish that I was aware was of but couldn't wake up or move unless in the dream. Lasted about 20 minutes."
29,This just happened and I haven't had SP happen this way.,Sleepparalysis,3,I do believe this was sleep paralysis because it was in a waking up stage but it was still in a dream if that makes sense. But anyway I was in my room but not in my bed I was talking to this dude about my computer and he got really close and asked me a question and was putting pressure on a point on my waist that basically paralyzed me it sent a really weird spiraling almost tingling sensation through my body and I woke up and was slowly able to move. I then fell back asleep and it happened immediately again just not in the same way.
30,Any horror movies based on sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,11,0
31,My SP episodes are starting to feel too real.,Sleepparalysis,2,It seems like each night my episodes get worse and worse. Half of the time when an episode starts im wide awake and just paralyzed. I never see anything I just feel the pain that is happening to me. EX: during most SP episodes it feels like im being choked out and each time i try to move the hands around my neck get tighter and tighter. When the episodes are over I can still feel the pain from whatever was choking me.
32,Sleep paralysis pro! XD,Sleepparalysis,14,"Happens so regularly I’m at the point where I know it’s not real, still scary AF though! I’ve had it where Ive felt someone spooning me in bed really tightly, then I’d turn over on my back but then it holds me down. Ive felt like I’ve been screaming before but then I awoke everything was silent and family still asleep (normally light sleepers ). I’ve had a little gremlin/devilish looking creature, quite small, at the end of my bed running down towards my pillow. All scary shit but I put it down to lack of sleep.When it happens now I literally just stay calm, breath , say to myself in my head it’s not real and then it stops. A lot of other experiences I have which happen more regularly than the physical stuff is just loud noises or the sound of someone speaking to me /shouting just as I fall asleep. It really does make u not want to fall back asleep again though. Aren’t our minds FUN !"
33,Fine line between SP and dreaming,Sleepparalysis,6,"So lately my experience has been different but just as unnerving. 

Currently, what I believe to be SP, occurs just as I’m getting off to sleep - I tend to get into REM sleep within minutes as I’m usually exhausted (yay for ambulance shift work); but this dream state is almost instantly interrupted by SP (I think). 

So I’ll be dreaming then *bang* pitch black. Followed by the realisation that I can’t move and everything feels heavy. Now I don’t hallucinate (thank f***) but I get a sense that I’m on a countdown and I need to wake before “something” reaches me. 

Now I don’t know if this is SP or just an extension on dreaming. I’ve never experimented with just relaxing into the feeling so I don’t know what the outcome would be. 

Additionally, slightly away from my thoughts above, but when I’m “thrashing” to get out of this state - I can clearly feel my body as a dead weight but almost as if my “outline” is moving instead. Trippy stuff. 

Can anyone relate?"
34,A quick question,Sleepparalysis,6,Has your sleep paralysis demon ever spoken to you?
35,New SP condition...,Sleepparalysis,0,"I've had it since I was a teenager (43 now) and during the last few episodes I have an itch that I cannot scratch! 
So: paralyzed, shortness of breath, and itchy, but (thankfully!) no demons/shadow people!...Can anyone relate???"
36,So last night I experienced my first SP,Sleepparalysis,2,"So last night I experienced my first SP.. scariest thing i’ve ever had happen to me. I woke up in the middle of the night, hearing footsteps on the other side of my door. My door is behind my bed so I couldn’t see anything. I tried moving my head around, but couldn’t, I even tried screaming, I couldn’t. I Close my eyes in hope of falling asleep, but then I hear the weirdest noice ever. I can’t even describe it. I look up and theres a fucking 3 headed monster just looking at me. Then i closed my eyes and fell asleep. 
And honestly the scariest thing about this is, the next morning I go to School, and the first thing my best friend tells me, is that he had just experienced the same SP as me.... w.  T.   F."
37,Is this SP??,Sleepparalysis,3,"I’ll try to be vague.. I’ve had sleep paralysis on and off in my teen years (21 now), but I think it’s coming back. It’s just so different I’m not sure so if some of you could maybe help me gain some perspective. 

Every time I fall asleep I am woken up by the loudest bang you’d ever hear. Like a car crash happens in my brain and it jolts me awake and I think I was in a bomb explosion or something. This just started about 5 days ago and it happens 2-3 times a night. Last night was the worst, I really felt like somebody was in my house. I heard loud running footsteps and an alarm going off, and I was stuck in bed I couldn’t move. I was terrified. 

I swear I wake up and these sounds I hear feel so real. I’ve heard voices, screams, and bangs/crashes. It scares me to fall back asleep. I just don’t know what to do cause I’m losing so much sleep I feel like I’m losing my mind. I cry every time cause I’m so frustrated. 

Sorry for the rant guys.. anything helps ❤️"
38,First time experience with sleep paralysis last night.,Sleepparalysis,0,"So I’m 23 and have never had sleep paralysis until now. I’ve had other weird things like hallucinating when I wake up in the middle of the night.  
  
Last night I woke up around 2am unable to move. I was hallucinating like mad, stronger than ever before. I saw text scrolling over every surface. I feel like I could read it but it immediately slipped out of memory.  
  
The physical sensation felt a lot like mushrooms if you’ve ever done that. Really stoning sensation except I couldn’t move if I wanted to.  
  
I cant describe how it felt mentally. Really weird. Like a trip kinda, and I felt a mental energy crescendoing within me until I snapped out of it. Imagine anxiety/tension/fear building within you except it wasn’t a bad feeling. Very powerful."
39,is this sleep paralysis or something else?,Sleepparalysis,4,"Hi Guys,

For some time now, randomly during the night I get this weird sensation coming over my body. Sometimes it happens when i'm just falling asleep and sometimes i wake up to this feeling. So all of a sudden I feel this huge pulling force weighing on my body but also almost pulling me and I'm unable to move. I have to struggle a lot to finally shake myself 'awake' even though it feels like im already awake and just stuck. I always sleep on one side (not facing up) but it doesnt matter which side i sleep on, it happens on either side. One other thing I noticed is sometimes I cant fall asleep again without it happening again as im trying to fall asleep. Its very different to what ive heard about other peoples sleep paralysis but it feels like im being pulled into a black hole and I cant move.

Do you guys have any ideas on what i might be experiencing?

Thanks in advance"
40,Sleep Paralysis Podcast,Sleepparalysis,8,"

Hi everyone im glad to be posting to this group to see if anyone would like to share their sleep paralysis, out of body, experiences or astral project stories on my podcast. If so send me a message on here so we can talk!"
41,"Alien abduction, anyone?",Sleepparalysis,7,"I had an SP episode where I was lying in bed and all of a sudden I feel the strongest gravitational pull towards my open window. Outside the window it’s glowing green light, and the pull is so unbearable that I can’t breathe. I know in my heart I am about to be abducted by an alien ship. I try to resist the force pulling me upward- telepathically, with my heart pounding like a hammer against my chest. The most desperate and terrified I’ve ever felt. And then, suddenly, I begin to feel lighter. The green light fades and I can suddenly breathe again. The best relief I’ve ever felt. My heart slows its pressured beats and I slowly realize it was all a waking dream.

Has anyone else ever experienced some kind of abduction in their SP episodes?"
42,its not that bad,Sleepparalysis,1,"I have sleepparalysis once every few months and while its pretty horrifying atleast the first or second time you have it, its not that bad if you get used to it. 

Once i realise that Im in sleepparalysis I try to stay calm. The easiest way, atleast for me, to get out of it is to increase your breath frequency. Your body will get stressed and wake up eventually. 

If you know that you are in sleepparalysis you can do some funny stuff with your thoughts because you are almost asleep and dreaming. I once thought about the creepiest thing I could imagine and tried to dream it. The results were ... pretty disappointing... I woke up and had to laugh about how crapy this ""nightmare"" was, because I knew what was going on and that I could control my thoughts."
43,WHY would anyone WANT sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,50,"Sleep paralysis is correlated with negative emotions and bad habits/lifestyles. Sleep paralysis is literally a nightmare! What people SHOULD want to induce is lucid dreaming, which is correlated with positive outcomes and habits. 

You don't NEED sleep paralysis to get into lucid dreaming. Yes, sp is on the way to lucid dreaming, but ONLY because sp is a disruption in REM sleep. So if you do a lucid dreaming technique wrong, your REM sleep may disrupt. 

I have more information about these sleep states and more on my blog. Please don't torture yourself with sp. 

I'll link my blog down below."
44,Sight Paralysed,Sleepparalysis,1,"So I've suffered intermittently from sleep paralysis for about 7 years now, but an experience I quite often get is that my sight becomes paralysed but my body can move in a dream like state. So I'll be in a dream where my eyes are fixed shut, and if I force them open with my fingers all I can see is what I'm facing in my sleep ie. usually the light on the ceiling as I sleep on my back. 

It's so weird for so many reasons as it's not like conventional sleep paralysis where my body is paralysed, and also I can't understand why my brain knows exactly what I'm facing in my sleep with my eyes shut (although I suppose this happens with normal sleep paralysis anyway). Even when sleeping in a completely different room which I did last night for the first time as I argued with my partner, my brain knew I was in a different room so when I forced my eyes open in the dream I saw this different room. Bizarre.

Anyway, anybody else have an experience similar to this? I'd be fascinated to know."
45,Please help sleep paralysis but I can move,Sleepparalysis,5,"This is my first time on Reddit and I've made this account to purposefully find out what's going on with my sleep.

I'll write two accounts of what's happened at two different times and see what you guys think of it. And I'll explain later on in the post about what it feels like. This has happened on more than the two occasions mentioned these two are just the most impactful times.

To start off I should say that I have been lucid dreaming all my life. It comes very naturally to me and I didn't realize it was weird until about age 15 (I'm 22 now). I dream very vividly every night multiple times and have very bad insomnia so.i wake up a lot in the night.

About 3 months ago I was asleep in my flat in Manchester. There's a train right outside my window so the room vibrates when a freighter goes past in the night and it usually wakes me up. So this night I heard the sound and i woke up. I saw something by my door and immediately started shitting myself and tried to sit up to get my phone. But I couldn't move and I was extremely distressed. This lasted for what felt like 2 hours with the thing still staying there and me desperately trying to move to sort the situation out.

Last night a similar thing happened except there was nothing in my room (most times this has happened I haven't seen anything demon like). I was trying to move and get out of bed for what felt like 2 hours. I was shouting my parents (this is at home) and I don't know if I was actually making noise as neither of them were home. I could hear the cat next door trying to get through my window and when I was actually able to move he was there so I know o must have been somewhat awake. Bearing in mind I wake up at the slightest of noise. When I did wake up it felt like I just broke out of what was happening to me and i was confused at why I couldn't move the whole time. 

Now to explain how I was feeling during these episodes. It didn't feel like normal sleep paralysis. I could definitely move without a doubt. I was literally grabbing the bed and moving myself with all my might only to end up back at my starting spot. When I woke up my bed was in such a state and at points when I could see clearer I was at different points of the bed and sometimes the floor. I could physically feel this as well and as someone with a lot of lucid dreaming experience it was not as it is in a lucid dream. I was physically exhausted from the amount of moving I was doing. I could also only open what felt like half an eye and what I could see was similar to that to mixing weed and alcohol (blurry, confusing and hazy). But I could definitely see and Could see myself desperately trying to move. I can't stress enough how much I was genuinely moving I wasn't frozen but so weak like when you are in a dream and trying to run fast but just can't. But I was absolutely awake. 

Please can someone help me I'm honestly terrified of going to sleep because it feels never ending and doesn't fit with any sleep paralysis symptoms and it's nothing like any lucid dream I've experienced."
46,Has anyone else ever seen this thing?!?,Sleepparalysis,0,"Alien? Demon? Sleep Paralysis story..

   About ten years ago, I was living in downtown Indianapolis with a friend of mine.  It was a Saturday afternoon, and he was working an auto body job and had to be in that day.  I was home alone.
   For some reason I was tired and so I decided to go lay on my bed.  I never take naps due to a lifetime of lucid dreams and sleep paralysis episodes, and so I did not intend to fall asleep; just lie down and relax my eyes.  However, right from the start I had violated the first unwritten “sleep” rule I ever created, which is “Never fall asleep on your back”.  This is because sleeping on my back ALWAYS induces sleep paralysis.
     This is the most terrified I’ve ever been.  I’ll try to explain as best as I can.
    
   My eyes were closed and I was just watching the back of my eye lids.  I began to notice an area closing in on my vision, which was even darker than the backs of my eye lids, from the outside inward.  
   Once the edges of the darkness touched together and fully closed, suddenly I found myself gripping the wrists of something that was trying desperately to choke the life from me.  
    It was tall and long-limbed and looked very much like a grey alien does.  Its skin was pale grey and wet looking.  Its eyes were very big and glassy, like fish bowls filled with ink.  Same head as the grey alien, except much more gaunt and pronounced cheek bones.  And it had a mouth.  Kindof.  More like 5 or so vertical slits where a mouth should be.
   But the worst part were its hands.  They were fairly large, but his fingers were very very long.  There were joints spaced about evenly all the way down each finger, and each finger seemed to move independently from the rest, like a snake with a limited number of joints would move.  
  Since I was trying very hard to hold his hands up by the wrists, his fingers were wrapping around the back of my neck and around my throat.  
   I couldn’t think clearly because, the only way I can explain it is, he was scrambling my thoughts with some kind of static waves.  I had to will myself awake and just like a Nightmare on Elm Street scene, he disappears into thin air and my arms are at my sides.
   It was just as real in my experience as I am sitting here today.  Has anyone else seen or experienced this thing?!?  I’ve been dealing with sleep paralysis since I was five.  This was different.  Let me know!!!"
47,how to induce sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,4,"is there a step by step process that i can do? i just want expirence this thing once and never again.

can i play chess with my sleep paraysis demon?"
48,People of reddit please tell me what just happened to me.,Sleepparalysis,26,"So here's what happened, I fell asleep at around 1:00 AM in the morning. I ""woke up"" who knows when. I thought I was sitting there with my (eyes closed)- idk if that can happen in SP but that was the thing. I felt this absolute titanic shaking in my legs, I noticed they were up in the air so I kept trying to put them down on the bed (I thought I was having a seizure).  Now here's the freaky part I felt this presence in the corner of my room by the door, which was scaring me to new levels of scared. So I tried to scream nothing came out and every time I tried the shaking would get so much worse. Now here's the part that makes me question if it was SP or just some lucid night terror. I got up out of bed and went to tell me dad and rinse and repeat the whole thing six times. After telling my dad I would be back in my room I didn't even walk. (At this point I was pretty sure I wasn't awake.) And then I would experience the whole thing again. Finally actually woke up around 2:30 AM, is that long enough for my brain to experience that? What just happened to me guys?

To hopefully answer any questions yes I have been extremely stressed lately, yes my sleep schedule has been awful lately. 
The whole experience my eyes were closed except for once when my left I opened (couldn't see anything), and out of pure terror I forced it closed.

Edit: and what helped me was actually telling someone and taking a nice long shower.

Thank you guys for coming and responding so quickly you're all awesome. 

Also wanted to add for clarification I'm 16."
49,Does anybody else feel like someone is grabbing them during sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,4,I've been getting sleep paralysis my whole life but only in recent years have I statted to feel like someone grab me and touch me. What's even weirder is that it seems to be of a sexual nature. One incident that stands out to me is when I was in sleep paralysis and there were 'shadow people' (they look like 'fuller' black stick men to me with purple 'eyes' that look almost like a flame) standing around. One of them was thrusting his pelvis into me extremely violently as if he was trying to rape me and saying things like 'you like that you little bitch?' (no joke). Funnily enough though since then when I get sleep paralysis I don't feel anyone touching me now. Has anybody had a similar experience?
50,How to fight SP,Sleepparalysis,0,"You can fight the demons/aliens/exgirlfriend/spirits or whatever whatever you call them easily.

If you find yourself paralyzed and unable to move, try to CALM down and focus on one point like your BREATHING and then force a movement(hands or legs are generally the easiest). Most of the time this works and you will wake up. 

Sometimes the entity is smart and when you move, you will move your astral body and not your physical bady so you won't awaken. But this doesn't matter as you will get to know and re focus on your physical body and breathing (MEDITATION)

Another more fool proof way according to some sources like Qur'an and ayurvedic texts is to sleep on your side as apparently the bodies energy flow is stagnant if we sleep on our backs or stomach and it's easy for them to paralyze you. 

The wierd dreams won't stop but they can not paralyze you so easily."
51,I want SP again.,Sleepparalysis,3,"I've had sleep paralysis since I was 17 years old (26 now) and let me tell you, it has been a WILD ride. I could go on about my experiences as they vary from the ""boring"" pressures to the skin chilling sights, but that's not for this post. There was a few months that I would have an SP event almost twice a week. So often that I had gotten so close to actually figuring out how to turn them lucid... but for 6 months now I've had a dog. Since having Goose, I've only had a very mild event that didn't last very long. I kind of miss the SP events.

Is there a way to kind of ""influence"" sleep paralysis?"
52,Hallucinating but not paralyzed?,Sleepparalysis,5,"I’ve been having vivid, rememberable dreams for the past several days, mostly all “nightmares” (they were stressful but not scary) about breaking into others’ houses/preventing people breaking into my own, and mundane stuff like being late for work.

Last night I was having the late for work dream again, when I awoke suddenly to the feeling of something touching me. Something kind of sharp, but not pointy? Like the end of a ruler or something. I dunno.

I woke up with a jolt and kind of sat up to swat at whatever was touching me, but there was nothing of course... but at the foot of my bed I just briefly saw a silhouette of a person. It looked at me, then its head turned away and it just kind of... slipped around the corner from my view and was gone.

I was rather unsettled and confused but went back to bed anyway. After waking up properly in the morning I thought maybe one of my roommates had been in my room for some reason. I’ve asked them and they all say no.

Could this is SP? Or something else? I definitely was able to move. Maybe that was all a dream too?"
53,Has anyone with SP embraced it and used it to develop psychic abilities/clairvoyance or anything of that sort?,Sleepparalysis,15,"If so, how did you do it?"
54,I just had Another SP after My last 1 and a Half Month ago I'm 15,Sleepparalysis,6,I'm a 15 year old And I'm Worried that this may Occur More in my Life 1st SP was a Nightmare that had Long arms reaching out for me with White glowing eyes reach out for me like the one from Scp 087 the Game. 2nd wasn't as bad I just Closed my eyes and fell asleep waking up instantly. I'm Just worried if this is Something Normal Or Not.
55,Experiencing sleep paralysis every time I nap???,Sleepparalysis,2,"Hi. So up until 2 months ago, I had never experienced sleep paralysis. I'm a college student so my sleep schedule hasn't been 'normal' in years. I used to take naps almost everyday in between/after classes. But the sleep paralysis is new. It's always when I'm waking up from a nap, never during a full nights sleep, at least to my recollection. And its now progressed to happening EVERY time I take a nap, which is about 3-4 times a week. It's like my mind is awake but my body is still asleep, and I can't move or scream. I live alone and I have a reoccurring hallucination/dream/idk that someone is breaking into my apartment. I could hear them entering the door and messing with the lock, and loud footsteps coming towards my bedroom. I kept trying to force myself to move, for my body to wake up or scream or just something, but i was frozen. 

Is it normal to experience sleep paralysis this often, and so specifically associated with naps? I also got kind of nervous when I googled it and saw it could be a sign of underlying mental health issues :/         I guess it could also be associated with the stress of the pandemic? I've just been avoiding taking naps at this point."

57,My brother passed away a few years ago,Sleepparalysis,2,"This is fairly short because for me they never last long. My boyfriend had gone to work around 6AM, usually this wakes me up and I back to sleep until around 9AM. This time, I fell asleep on my back, it happened so quickly I wasn't even aware I was sleeping, just immediately pulled into a dream. There stood my dead brother, and my sister who was standing in front of him with her back turned. I tried to tell her our brother was right there, tried to tell her to turn around, but as I was doing this indistinctive whispering got louder and louder until I woke up in sleep paralysis. The sleep paralysis only lasted a few seconds, it seemed like it had only really been a few seconds since I had fallen asleep, but I just wiggled my toes and woke up."
58,To the consciousness of reality and of dream,Sleepparalysis,10,"Hey all, I am practicing dream yoga for quite some time now and have learned and experienced a lot about human existence and the creation of the universe.

So, this is my take to reality and consciousness which might help you to see what my mind wants to say. You all can find it [here](http://mindonmushroom.com/) and let me know how you perceive it. Chao!"
59,My first and only sp with an entity,Sleepparalysis,7,"My worst and only experience was after I watched a horror movie. 

I 'woke up' and looked at the ceiling. But there was this transparent, starfish like think creeping towards me. When it was right above me it dropped down and slowly moved up to my face. 

I was confused for a second and wanted to laugh for some reason. But then it darted into my mouth, I could feel it feeling my insides. My heart, lungs, everything. I couldn't breathe as I convulsed. I was able to feel how my heart slowly stopped working and my lungs were unable to function properly. My head began to hurt as a feeling of hate filled me. I don't know how exactly I did it but I forced myself out of sleep paralysis. My face was beet red and my heart barely pumped but I was alive."
60,Rapid heartbeat?,Sleepparalysis,0,Does rapid heart beat when wanting to induce SP mean I’m getting there? Like I’m not even nervous but my heart is racing like a mf
61,An interesting problem I feel is unique but terrifying,Sleepparalysis,6,"  Sorry if this post is worded poorly or is all over the place. I just woke from this episode and needed to write it somewhere and hopefully find answers. I'm currently in somewhat of a frenzy and have a splitting headache from it. 

  So recently I've been experiencing this weird phenomenon where I can feel myself falling asleep.
Not like, the jolt some people talk about where they're falling asleep and feel like they're literally falling. But as in I'm laying in bed, and I feel my whole body turn completely numb, all while I'm completely conscious. It usually starts at my legs, then creeps up from there.
  I also hear a sound similar to when you have a big yawn-- that sort of rumbling sound in your head. Also, my heartbeat feels super pronounced, like although my heart is beating normally, it feels like it's beating super hard and super fast.
   I can snap out of this feeling, but if I do, when I try to fall back asleep, it just happens again. 
  To go into more detail of my exact feeling though, is I have my eyes closed, feel my body kind of ""turn off"" and the rumbling starts. I'm wide awake and fully conscious of what's happening, and sometimes I'm conscious long enough to start seeing a dream form. Usually I never get to that stage due to me either being scared or being in pain. Yes, the numbness hurts, surprisingly.
  Whenever I ""wake up"" from this and I open my eyes, it's kind of frightening. Sometimes I can see things like I'm dreaming, sometimes it's auditory, sometimes it's both. My vision is always super shaky and my body is also shaky, like I'm in a super intense earthquake.

One last thing, I feel incredibly sore throughout my body, but most intensely in my arms. Also, the headache I got from it is damn near unbearable 

TLDR; My body starts falling asleep while my brain is conscious when I try to go to sleep and the experience is terrifying and painful.

I don't expect anyone to read this, and I especially don't expect any answers. But, if someone could give me an idea of what this is, if I have some disorder or something. Or if someone also experiences this, I'd be grateful to hear about it. Thank you.

Edit: Just learned this is a form of sleep paralysis, predormital to be specific. I was under the impression that sleep paralysis was something you only experience while waking up, I had no idea you could experience it while falling asleep."
62,Several months SP free! Auditory hallucinations?,Sleepparalysis,1,"Not sure what I’ve done differently, but I have been several months sp free now. So relieved! Last year I was experiencing it more frequently and now suddenly not at all. While I know visual ‘demons’ are common with sp (and I have experienced them as well). I more frequently heard my hallucinations: footsteps ascending the stairs, walking around the room,talking, and dogs barking (no longer have dogs but they sounded like dogs from my memory) to name a few. It always felt like someone or something was in the apartment that shouldn’t be and a sense of impending doom. 

Are auditory hallucinations common?"
63,I think I just experienced sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,3,"I think I just experienced sleep paralysis, I thought maybe it was a spirit or something, I was half asleep half in a dream, I was in a room and could only stare up at the ceiling while my body was hovering horizontally, the whole dream I kept thinking and feeling of a spirit or a ghost presence, I couldn’t move, speak, or yell, and then I felt a creeping sensation touching my body kind of like getting a cold shiver, and then forceful pressure holding my chest and arms down it happened a few times til I finally woke up it was pretty scary though I’ve never had that happen before. I went to sleep about an hour earlier and had a really terrorizing nightmare, I was being chased the whole dream and it was really vivid."
64,"Last night I was able to induce sleep paralysis by closing my eyes, lying completely still and focusing where my chest would be. The feeling I had when I achieved it felt like a whole body orgasm.",Sleepparalysis,14,Has anyone else experienced this before?
65,What is happening to me?,Sleepparalysis,3,"So when I was a child I was forced to watch The Excorcist. It terrified me. After that time (all the way to being a teenager) I began having SP. I genuinely thought I there was a demon trying to possess me all of those years. I would wake up mid episode paralyzed trying to scream at the demon to get out of my room. 

Then I found out what SP was and that helped A LOT! All of a sudden having a name for it gave me the ability to talk myself out of an episode. I’d just say “This is that thing. You’re ok. Just let yourself wake up.” 

They’ve been gone now for years. On the extremely rare occasion that I have one, again, I can talk myself out of it.

But lately (the last year or so) something new has popped up. Last night was the worst it’s ever been. 

It starts in my feet. It feels like extremely heavy tension in the air, like the air is so dense it’s trying to compress my body. Then it works it way up my legs until it reaches my head. I hate it. It makes my body heat up and tingle. I don’t know if it’s also causing my heart to race or if that’s just happening because I feel scared. 

While it happens, I am wide awake. I can move and I see my room like normal. Tbh, what if feels like to me is that there’s something that doesn’t want to let me sleep. There isn’t a rhyme or reason as to what causes it. I don’t feel pain at all. Just uneasy and scared. 

Is this just a different form of SP? Has anyone had this experience or possibly spoken to a doctor? (tThats not really an option for me in COVID world right now...)

EDIT: I guess I should mention that I ALWAYS feel like there’s a presence in the room. I feel it when my eyes are closed and it almost forces me to open my eyes and check every time."
66,Is this sp?,Sleepparalysis,2,I fell asleep and idk somehow when i wanna wake i realise my heart feels weaker and weaker arms and legs too i wanna get up but i just cant. I CAN FEEL THAT IM GETTING WEAKER as i struggled to wake up. Eventually igave up and it went away i thought my heart had problems
67,I died in my dream...then sleep paralysis happened.,Sleepparalysis,3,"I didnt realize that I was experiencing sp at the time, I thought I had died and ""moved on"". I was aware of my death and was in a black void with nothing but my thoughts for eternity. It was the scariest thing I've ever experienced."
68,Sleep paralysis and false awakening loop where I cant move and keep falling over,Sleepparalysis,2,"I will occasionally have flash awakenings (with many loops) and sleep paralysis at the same time. I try to shake myself out of the dreams and false awakenings. If I succeed, when I try to wake up and get up (in the next false awakening) i feel very top heavy and i keep falling over and rolling uncontrollably. This is very disturbing. I've tried to find someone else who knows what I'm experiencing, but I can't find anything. 
Normally, I have about 3/4 dreams every night. I remember them all very clearly and they're very complex and vivid. Sometimes, they will connect- like I am in the same dream again in a different part of the same setting. I've had dreams in French, dreams where I make up jokes and invent things. I usually always wake up between 3:10 and 3:30am. (Among other times in the night, usually 1 or 12, and 4 or 5)
Its really exhausting. 
My biggest concern is these somersault like dreams, or falling off the bed and rolling over and over. 

PLEASE HELP! Any answers/experiences shared would be amazing."
69,Anyone else?,Sleepparalysis,3,"I /unfortunately/ experience sleep paralysis several times a month. I work night shift and have 2 small children so live in a state of constant sleep deprivation. I often read of people having intense nightmares/dreams/hallucinations etc., however I am always aware I’m in paralysis. I am in my paralysis state screaming for help and trying desperately to wake up and have someone wake me up. My husband says sometimes I lay there shaking, almost seizure like, whereas other times he would never know it’s occurring. Does anyone else experience this? Knowing and recognizing the state and just trying to wake up without the horrific dreams?"
70,Quetzalcoatl,Sleepparalysis,5,"Hello. Recently I've been having a lot of sleep paralysis. First two ones were the 'hooded figure' which just stared at me, looking down at me with no apparent sign of harm; it was merely observing me while I was laying on my back and gazed up at its glowing eyes. I did not feel frightened, just perplexed. The second time I was sleeping on my side and was within my duvet with a small hole to peak through and I saw the same being but only half of its body,it's long ghostly drapes which slowly moved by. 

The other week I was sleeping on my side facing the wall and I had a very prevalent feeling something was behind me and that immense paranoia, anxiety , and terror began to hit me very very suddenly during rem sleep. A very blocky snake & dragon like creature that resembled that of Aztec appeared in my vision as if I had eyes at the back of my head as the being was not in front of me. I was definitely paralyzed though I somehow managed to or simply imagined that I hid under my duvet in hope it would go away but the thing swepted right under with me with its tail and its face came right up to mine and gave such a mocking and sinister gaze like ""ha ha , you cant hide"". 

I woke up. I immediately searched Google ""Aztec snake"" and I was astonished by the results. It came up the God ""Quetzalcoatl"" which goes back to 1150 BC and doing some digging I find very intriguing information. ""Quetzalcoatl is believed to have essentially contributed to the creation of man"" and lots of more info that if you're interested you can Google yourself because there is a rabbit hole of this info. I've never heard of this thing before. I don't even know how to pronounce Quetzalcoatl. I've been saying to myself that it could have been a mere coincidence but the thing is, I would never have known about this being if I did not have this particular sleep paralysis. A very strange one."
71,Textbook sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,2,"Last night I had an intense SP that was abundance in terror, paranoia, and just utterly saddened by the experience. I was sleeping on my side facing the wall and as soon as I fell asleep a sudden prevalent sense of someone behind me occured.

 I did not see it yet somehow I saw it and it was the grim reaper with even the sickle. It was scraping the back of my head with the very edge of the sickle, though a mere tingling sensation was felt. However, I thought this was it and I was just thinking in horror of what events were going to follow next. 

I recall a vague memory of being partly in two different realms at the same time , like I was dead and alive and I was merely being ""tickled"" or that somehow there was some law in the way preventing the reaper getting me. It was a very textbook horror fiction like experience."
72,"Phenibut, Demons and Nightmares",Sleepparalysis,1,"Disclaimer: Everything written is basically just a stream of consciousness written the moment I woke up. Apologies for poor grammar, spelling and writing. 

I couldn't move but I thought I was 
Every time I thought I woke 
Every time I was still in the dream
Time kept looping 
I was semi concious on my side 
Time kept looping 
I tried to get help so many times 
Nothing worked 
I was convinced that I had a serious injury in my right eye 
The only action I was capable of in the real world was murmuring for help

I'm pretty sure that what I just experienced was a semi lucid sleep paralysis. Multiple times throughout the trip I found myself laying on my right side looking straight ahead, this was the center of the 'time loop'. Each time after returning to this position I was convinced that I had stopped dreaming and was now in the real world. I would try in various different ways to search for help and with every unsuccessful attempt I would find myself back at the beginning. 

The senarious varied wildly in desperation and duration. In one I fought through obstructions in my room, out of the door and up the stairs to find [my stepfather]. I woke him with an incoherent outburst of dialogue, explaining that my eye was injured and something had fallen through my ceiling. After listening, seemingly concerned for a moment, he gave an antagonising look and said the words 'everything is going to plan'. Some attempts to rectify the situation were as simple as trying to turn my desk lamp on. However, although I could see my surroundings I was unable to affect them. 

Sometime into the dream I became aware of a presences in my room, watching me. On one unsuccessful attempt to end it I tried to fight the presence head on, which had by this point physically manifested as a large black floating head. 

At random intervals between lying in bed semi concious I experienced scenes that took place in an unknown forrest with my older sister. One detail I remember was a conversation between us where I asked ""did I take any drugs?"" to which she responded ""yes... Do you really not remember?"". It was in one of these forest interludes when I realised I was dreaming. I tried to study the details of my sister's face and read signage that were for some reason in the vicinity, all unsuccessfully, confirming I was dreaming. During one of the scenes the same figure that had haunted me in my room had appeared in the woods. Although it beared no superficial similarities I understood it as the same presence.

Much of what I experienced was consistent with stories I had heard of sleep paralysis. The shadowy figure fits the description of what most people would call a 'sleep paralysis demon'. During the dream I also felt as if my body was under immense pressure. Many times I tried to fight the force pushing down on me but was unable to.

In total the experience was completely maddening. Each time I found myself laying on my side and opening my eyes I thought that I had finally persevered and made it back to conciousness. But these breife moments of clarity would always without detection slip back into the surreal nightmare. I have no idea how long it lasted but for a brief while I was truly begging to question whether I would ever escape. 

[P.S] Shortly after recording this experience I recalled that earlier the previous day (around 3pm) I had taken 1.5 grams of a drug usually prescribed to people suffering from various forms of anxiety known as phenibut. The friend who gave the phenibut to me described it as being comparable to xanax. Throughout the day I didn't experience any tangible effects from the drug and eventually chalked it up to have not taken enough to be considered a recreational dose. Throughout the day I also consumed around 8 units of alcohol (on the lover side of average for me) so I'm not sure how much of an effect, if any, this would have had. 

This was my first time experimenting with phenibut however, I have since read that sleep paralysis and other sleep abnormalities are common side effects of the drug. 

This is also my first time experiencing sleep paralysis and I just have to ask ""how the fuck do some you people ever sleep knowing that you're going to go through this multiple times a week?"""
73,Tingling/weird occurrence when falling asleep and sleep paralysis question.,Sleepparalysis,1," So two nights ago, I recently pulled an all nighter and had to go to bed. I also tried attempting a Lucid Dream for fun but I'm pretty sure I was about to triggering a sleep paralysis.

It started with me attempting to repeat a random phrase in my head. I did it over and over and became relaxed. This is when my lower legs started to go numb/tingle. This rose up to my lower torso and then my arms. It felt like I was being put on sleeping gas.

I was still repeating this phrase in my head but I also started to freak out (heart was racing, starting to sweat, etc.) because I was in fear of sleep paralysis.

At this point, I was going to stop so I began moving my fingers and this had no problem. I was able to move and all sensations immediately went away.

If I had continued, would have I suffered a sleep paralysis?"
74,What was your earliest sp attack?,Sleepparalysis,2,What was your earliest sleep paralysis attack or sp attack or at least the first one you remember mine was when I was around 5 and it was this shadow of a kid who walked around my room for like a couple of times when I got out of the attack I thought it was real and went to my parents who just took it as a bad dream but now I think it was a sp attack and my house wasn’t actually happend.
75,Some questions about sp,Sleepparalysis,10," Hi I'm a 13 year old boy who had 2 sp so far. The first one was when I woke up at like 5 am, tried going back to sleep and slowly started to feel my body going numb. Next thing I know I hear ringing noises and static..... then ROARING AND BREATHING IT WAS SO LOUD. It took like 5 minutes for me to wake up. I was so terrified.
 The second one was yesterday. It took like 5 seconds and wasn't terrafying at all. 
 What is strange to me is that I haven't opened my eyes in neither of them (i'm so fricking glad) is it normal?
 Now neither of them were as terrafying as the stuff I read about here so I want to never have a sp again. Is there a way to lower the chances of it happening again even though it happned only twice this summer? 
What I also noticed is that thinking ""your not real"" or ""your not scary"" helped me to wake up. Is this an actual way to wake up or was it just a coincidance? If not, any other ways to wake up fast?"
76,Sleep paralysis and a dead sister,Sleepparalysis,15,"I've never experienced sleep paralysis before last night. And given the circumstances I'm not sure what to make of it or even think. My boyfriend lost his sister yesterday in a very tragic and unexpected way. They were extremely close. Him and I were up most of the night crying and me just trying to comfort him. I fell asleep for a short time and then I was abruptly woken up by something pulling at my feet. It was like a nightmare in real life. The room was dark but I could see a shadowy figure at the end of the bed pulling my foot, seemingly trying to drag me out of bed. I couldn't speak, I tried to scream but all that would come out were muffled whimpers. It went on for what seemed like an hour and I was scared to look at the bottom of the bed. I was able to finally fall into a restless sleep.
This morning I told my boyfriend about what I experienced last night and his eyes got huge and his skin broke out in goosebumps. He told me he saw my foot moving last night and also felt something touch his foot at the same time. Right after he felt something touch his foot, he said the cat ran off the bed. 
He thinks his sister came to us last night and I want to believe him. It just felt so sinister. But it makes sense to me that she would appear and try in a way to say it's okay. 
I'm still kinda freaked out."
77,I think my sleep paralysis is the scariest,Sleepparalysis,0,"When I have sleep paralysis I almost cannot breath since I sleep on my stomach, I also can’t wake up or open my eyes so it’s like I’m being held down by something and I can’t do anything except use all my strength to move or open my eyes. It usually ends when I get minor access to my body and move around with limitations then I wake up by focusing all my will and strength into opening my eyes or I land back on my stomach unable to move again and then I fall asleep sweating and breathing rapidly. I had one time where I woke up and tried to move but I barley could then I suddenly got weaker and my eyes began closing then someone entered the room and I tried to call for help but I couldn’t so I just feel asleep.
I’ll tell more stories later today"
78,Sp dreams without a nap and an extra person and time travel and a headache,Sleepparalysis,3,"Hi all! I've had sp for most of my life and since it's always lucid, I have sort of learned to accept and control it. Learning to calm down in my sp state usually makes me snap out of it faster and I've been practicing this successfully for years now.

It's gotten to be pretty consistent. Nearly all of my sp occurs when I take naps rather than during the night. It might have something to do with messing up the sleep stages. I dunno, but I've mostly stopped taking naps because of it. Also, every episode is accompanied by more or less the same dream. I'm always alone in my bedroom. The room itself changes and it might be my current bedroom, a past bedroom or something I don't recognize at all. In each sp dream episode, I'm fully aware that I'm sleeping and stuck in this sp state. I wander around the room in a state of mild anxiety, always finding a mirror to watch myself in. Even though my eyes are closed, I can see myself through my eyelids. I eventually go lay in the bed and try to calm down, pretend to be sleeping so that I'll wake up in real life. It always works. 

Today was different though. My alarm goes off at 6am and then again every 10 minutes of I snooze it. I kept snoozing it and going back to sleep so I must have messed up the stages again or whatever because there I was in my sp bedroom again. I was alone, sitting on the edge of the bed. There was a TV on in the background, playing music. Being lucid, I told the TV to play matchbox 20 instead. It complied, but only for a few minutes before switching back to something else. I turned back to it angrily and said ""No! I said play matchbox 20!"" And it did. I felt more anxious this time because I knew I didn't have time for sp. I had to get up and go to work.

 
I was about to go lay in the bed like I always do when suddenly one of my coworkers was in the bed with me. I have NEVER had another person be present in my sp dreams until today. It was as though we shared the room and I wasn't happy about it because she's kind of difficult in real life. She kept talking to me so I got up and went to the window. I could see myself reflected in it and I was younger and thinner, like when I was a teenager. Then my focus switched to what lay outside the window. It looked like some sort of crowded village or festival. The McDonald's was clearly from the 70s (I was born in the 80s) and I knew I had gone back in time. I bounced around the room anxiously before I finally went to lay down. It took so much longer for me to wake up this time. When I finally did, my head hurt and felt enormously heavy. I could barely keep my eyes open. This part always happens and I have to sit up immediately or risk going back to the sp sleep state.

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading my nonsense. It makes me feel better to write it down. Thoughts and ideas are appreciated. ❤️❤️"
79,Hallucinations.,Sleepparalysis,0,"So I don't know how many times I've had sleep paralysis. I do hower know that I've had two where I've been hallucinating.
The thing is, when that happend I kind of saw my body as if I were floating abow it. I know there is a thing called Astral projection but I know it wasn't that. Bcs I hallucinated that the girl from the ring crawled up to me, grabbed my head and wishpered into my ear😂the other one was that ants crawled into my ear and sung opera haha. But my question is, is that normal? That you can see your own body as if floating abow it when you are hallucinating while having sleeping paralysis? Sorry for bad English.

Also, advice, if you feel a headache, then you could try to wake up and it can prevent paralysis. That usually works for me!"

82,I feel something scratch my head,Sleepparalysis,7,"So 2 years ago I had a lot of sp. I was actually very  curious about it and wanted to try. I knew it was the state before lucid dreaming but I never get into it.. The first time was weird, I could actually feel when I was getting into sp by the weird buzzing sound/noise you hear when your body's entering this weird state.
Anyway everytime I tried I was too scared by all the sound and weird body felling you get by doing it so I was just twitching my toe, getting out of this and returned to sleep.
A night I did provoke it. But I knew I was sp-ing by the weird noise I heard. And just before twitching my toe to get out something just scratch my head, like when you scratch a dog or a cat but stronger.
It fucking scared the shit out of me. It wake me up, stood and run to open the light, and sure there was nothing.
Anybody got touched or scratch in sp ?"
83,Scared to sleep,Sleepparalysis,7,I had sleep paralysis for the first time last night and now I’m scared to sleep. It’s very late at night and I decided I’m not gonna sleep tonight  because I’m scared I will get it again. I know this isn’t the best decision but the fear is overwhelming. I’m hoping tomorrow night I won’t feel as scared. Any tips on how to reduce the fear?
84,"Weird knocking during my SP dream, sounded sooo real",Sleepparalysis,7,"Haven’t had SP in a while but had a weird one last night. 
I could hear someone knocking at front door (I’m in an apartment so not too far from my bedroom). The knocking didn’t sound like normal knocking, it sounded like how it sounds when you hit something with a rolled up poster. You know that sound? 
So the way most of my SP dreams have been going are like this: I’m having a dream that looks like my room/me in my room experiencing SP, but it’s all in a dream. 
So for this one, me and my boyfriend were sleeping in my bed and we woke up and heard the knocking. We both were confused and didn’t know who would be here or why they’d be knocking like that, but I was paralyzed and kept telling him to grab my hand. He didn’t get why and I just kept saying “GRAB MY HAND!.” It was a lot of commotion and noise and it felt and sounded sooooo real. 
Then all of a sudden I break out of the SP and wake up, only to find all that was a dream and my apartment was quiet. Even though I was relieved, it was such an uneasy feeling realizing it wasn’t real."
85,Lucid Nightmare Paralysis Talking,Sleepparalysis,0,"Is there a real name for this?  I have always had a combo of lucid nightmares and SP.  But now I can breathe loudly enough, or blow air, or make noises loudly enough to wake up my boyfriend so he can wake me up.  (Lucky for him right, it scares the sht out of him haha).  Sometimes I am also able to say out loud, “ wake me up!!!”   Tonight it happened twice.   The first time I was blowing air onto his back.  Then I fell right back into it and I screamed WAKE ME UP."
86,High pitched ringing in ears,Sleepparalysis,2,"Hi there, tonight when I was trying to sleep I started hearing this high pitched ringing in my ears, so loud it was almost painful. It only would happen when my eyes were closed and once I opened them it went away. I ended up being so tired I almost fell asleep and it turned into full on radio static, SO loud it actually hurt. So I went to sit up and found I couldn’t move at all. I had never had sleep paralysis before so I was pretty freaked out. It only lasted a couple seconds until I figured out I could wiggle a foot and brought myself out of it. Is that sort of thing common? Is the ringing a symptom of sleep paralysis? I’m scared to go back to sleep and could use some advice."
87,This might be helpful/interesting,Sleepparalysis,0,"So a follow up from my last post about something having sex with me in sp.  I’ve tried some of the things ppl told me like using white sage and getting a better sleep schedule. The white sage didn’t work so I started looking for help like therapy or something, even tho I felt like it wouldn’t work because I mean everything I experienced felt so real.  My family kept trying to say how I could some how be hallucinating or trippin out like mistaking the breathing noise I heard in sp for my own or something...

But believe me I considered that for the LONGEST.. like I’m a atheist and everything I don’t or at the time didn’t believe in that spiritual stuff. I didn’t even come out about it until I was almost 100% sure I wasn’t freaking out like during the breathing incident I made sure to hold my breathe for a while during it and even though I held my breath, I still heard it.  Like just think about the sensations you can even feel and not just during sp but after. Sometimes after it I can still feel the area of my body that was hurt or messed with.  Ofc you’d try to think “oh maybe my body is just heavily reacting to the hallucinations” kinda like a wet dream or whatever but cmon if you’ve experienced this u know what I mean. 

Anyways my mom knew someone who believes in spiritual stuff and she knew how to do certain things too.  When I called her all I said was “I’ve been having sp way too much lately” and I said nothing about the sex/breathing/noises and stuff because I still wasn’t comfortable talking about it to other people but it didn’t even matter because right after that she told me “hold on for a second I’ll call u back” and when she called me back there was another lady on the phone (I think it was her daughter) and before I even got to speak she said “so has this thing been having sex with you?” I was so shocked, I wasn’t sure I heard her right so she repeated the same thing to me then all i said was “yes” after that they basically told me a bunch of stuff and as the convo went on she started saying how she picked up some sort of aura on me except that it didn’t come from me but someone else.. 

-Anyways they started saying how I needed to get closer with God and start praying/ reading the Bible if I wanted it to stop and tbh even tho it only has been like a week or 2 since then my sp hasn’t been that crazy so far.. and basically that’s what made me start to believe like I assume she must of did something after I called her because how else did she know what I was experiencing just from saying I have sp?? And that wasn’t the only thing she figured out but the other stuff is too personal to share on here. Other people have said it their self, there’s too many coincidences guys please start praying and reading up on it. 

She even told me their story when she astral projected and how there’s 3 things. The body, soul, and spirt. And even this makes sense like how does everyone describe what falling into sp feels like?? It feels like ur being “pulled” in a way. Again if you’ve experienced it enough u know what I mean. It’s like we’re stuck, like for whatever reason our spirit is trying to come out but it can’t. And I think this is because we don’t know how to astral project but we’re more prone to it happening in a way.  It just makes to much sense like if u go over to the astral projection sub u can see how it’s kinda similar in a way or even how they use sp in order to project.

And lastly I’m not trying to force anyone to believe I just thought this all was very interesting and I’m not knocking the science of it at all.  I do think we hallucinate in it at the same time since we’re kinda in a dream state, and having a good sleep schedule definitely helps, it has helped me too. 

I apologize for making this so long but all I’m saying is think about this for a bit.  You’ve experienced it for yourself."
88,I Steel see my sleep paralysis demon after my sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,1,"This also happens when i dont have sp but i am in a location that remindes me of a SP i had like my room. I still see the creatures i see in my sleep paralysis  in the shadows or around corners watching me, this causes me stress and some times the stress adds to other stress that leades me to another SP. And i am afraid of sleeping, because when i try to relax myself when i try to sleep i feel the presence of the creatures, but also i am afraid that not sleeping will only make all thing worse. What can i do to stop this?"
89,Help me with my Research Thesis on Sleep-related​ Experiences and Dissociation by filling out this google survey form.,Sleepparalysis,18,"Form:

[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqNjaRdAsB49w2MgVtyM0yEDtvwxKOVJWm-CiM4563Flffxw/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqNjaRdAsB49w2MgVtyM0yEDtvwxKOVJWm-CiM4563Flffxw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

The Purpose of the study is to identify how personality traits and stress predict dissociation and sleep-related experiences among adults. Your help is appreciated."
90,Marble Man,Sleepparalysis,1,"So for context I’m a 37 year old Female .  I’ve had sleep paralysis since I was 6 years old. I still get them now if I’m sleep deprived or feeling anxious . Anyway,,, This is where it began...

I remember going into a nice comfortable deep sleep , Then all of a sudden I see from the perspective of “Marble Man “ walking down my street , Walking through the gate, up to my house door ( At this point my little body was so tense) . I could never open my eyes or move a finger . He would gradually walk through my living room up my stairs and stand outside my room . This is where things get horrifying . He would come into my room ( He wears all black , Think black Morph suit) Comes to the side of my bed and tickles me with what I’ve always described as “ Marbles on the end of his fingers “. He would then leave and I could see him leaving from his perspective. Fast forward about 7 years so I’m 13.. In my dream it pans out the exactly the same as the last 6 years but I think stuff this !!! In my dream I wake up and follow him to the landing on the top of my stairs, I confront him and I never have that dream ever again...

Now I have the feeling of not being able to move when I have an episode of sleep paralysis but he never appears. However,,, The last time I had one I heard “ Stacey” in a very sinister whisper right in my ear and now I’m worried he may be manifesting himself to come back....

Is this an other worldly being ? , When we have an episode is it one foot in another terrifying universe or is it simply just a dream ? Who knows but I know one thing ....At 37 it still doesn’t get any less scary :/"
91,"Does anyone else have this weird sleep paralysis ""sensory overload""?",Sleepparalysis,5,"For context: I often have moments of sleep paralysis, but they usually do not last too long I believe. What I'm describing in this post only happens every so often, no more than once a month and this was the first time I remember this happening in at least 4 months. 


So sometimes when I'm asleep or dreaming, it seems like my dream suddenly gets cut off suddenly (like, in the middle of the dream) and then replaced by these extremely loud noises. Almost like static or random noises like voices, alarms, etc. Then once I wake up from it, and hit that stage of paralysis, it's like all the noises are BOOSTED and even louder as I try to move. 


So for example: just a few minutes ago I woke up from hearing those noises in my sleep, and I could feel that I was paralysed but not only did the static noise get extremely loud (think of putting a computer speaker directly onto your ear and turing it to 100%, that's how loud it was), but I also started hearing the noises in my own house a lot louder than ever, and a random alarm siren thing and voice at the same time. This noise got louder until I was able to move, but even after I was able to get up and look around, I was still hearing that noise loudly, just not as loud as before. It settles after a few minutes of being awake. The noise sometimes gets louder if I try to move during paralysis as well. 


Does anyone else have experiences similar to mine? I remember this happening to me even when I was a little kid but could never explain it properly till now.


Edit for clarity: When I have normal bouts of sleep paralysis (this, way more often than what's described above) it's just a few light sounds of static or grinding, and not nearly as loud as what I described above."
92,When I was a teenager,Sleepparalysis,0,"About 15-18 years old, I experienced extremely strange and vivid dreams and sleep paralysis hallucinations. For a long time I abused the otc sleeping medication diphenhydramine, taking large doses to experience the weird effects. I believe this greatly contributed to the sleep paralysis. I've been looking for a place to share my experiences, and this just seems like the right place. I'll try to keep these explanations brief.
1. My first experience with sleep paralysis was as a young teenager, about 15. As I slept I would wake up, but not all the way, like we've all experienced so many times. I felt weight on my chest and the sense that someone wanted to hurt me. I felt as if I was screaming, but when I finally awoke for real I wasnt. This happened many times.
2. A year or so later I began having very strange and vivid dreams, too many to count. Often of being lost in a strange dreamscape or being chased. 
3. At this point I begin having what I think where either very vivid dreams or straight up hallucinations. In one case, I ""woke up"" and sat up in my bed to see my room become elongated and take on the shape of a road overgrown with foliage. At the end of the road was one of those dark figures we often see. Realizing I was still asleep I woke up, immediately was paralyzed by fear. I slept in a loft bed, with a curtain around it, and I saw a hand under the curtain and sensed someone close to me. I think I fell asleep praying, too afraid to get out of bed.
4. In another very vivid dream, I saw myself laying in the middle of a highway in what looked like hell. Infront of me some distance away was a tall demonic looking figure, it ran towards me and jumped on me pinning me to the ground. This was accompanied by the feeling of a huge weight on my chest. It looked into my eyes and I got the feeling the air was being sucked out of my lungs. The fear woke me up. 
5. Since entering my 20's these dreams have stopped. Although, I still experience sleep paralysis and hyptic jerks frequently. 
6. I saved this for last because its definitely a weird take. At the time of this, I owned a dream catcher that I had acquired from an antique store (bad idea). I believe this might have been the cause. I'm very superstitious."
93,I was stuck in a sleep paralysis dream loop,Sleepparalysis,13,I went out drinking last night with my friend and crashed at her house. I had a dream about getting up starting my day and then i walked into a room in my house and was paralyzed. I was paralyzed in the dream and was going in and out of reality state and dream state. I couldn’t officially break out i could wiggle my fingers a little but couldn’t wake up officially. I went back to the dream of starting my day and walking into the room where i got paralyzed. This happened maybe 4-5 times and then this time was different. I was paralyzed but there was a guy sitting behind me in a chair. He was older i think wearing a blue suit with a gold line on the pocket and smoking a cigar.  He had kind of an ugly face with bloodshot crusty looking eyes. He said you are linting. You need to see the difference or you will never escape the loop. I went through the loop again of the dream and being paralyzed. This time i could fully see the room i was actually in and i felt someone grab my throat. I knew i was moving my finger on my leg but my leg couldn’t feel anything. I broke free but i guess not completely because i couldn’t keep my eyes open again. This time dream loop i went into my closet instead of the room.  I had an urgency to find something. It actually looked identical to my closet at my house which was strange to me. The door was swinging slightly and i said to myself this is it maybe i am dreaming. Immediately i was paralyzed. Hands grab my throat. I WANT TO GET OUT a male voice screamed it felt like a hot air was pushed on my face. I was able to break free this time and i didn’t feel like i couldn’t keep my eyes open this time. And i definitely DID NOT go back to sleep
94,Non-scary Weird Sleep Paralysis experience,Sleepparalysis,2,"I was taking a nap when I had a sleep paralysis episode.  I usually don't halucinate but this time a felt something touch my back. I don't know why but I decided that it would be best if I just kept calm and thought about it in a positive way and it felt good and went away. I think the weirdest part was that I hallucinated leaving my body. I know it's just my brain but it felt so real. I didn't fully leave it or anything I just pulled halfway out and got tired. I remember thinking to myself that it felt tingly? I'm not really sure why. It's crazy what the brain can do. I think learning to keep calm during sleep paralysis makes it go much smoother, so I'll remember that next time I get it."
95,Has Anyone Else Never Been Scared During SP?,Sleepparalysis,7,"I've flown around my room, been choked, heard someone enter my room, had my mind flash disturbing images, been sat on (idk it felt like someone had sat on me and I could feel their bones digging into me lol it hurt) etc, but I've never felt threatened during sleep paralysis.

Idk if it's because I was aware of what it was before it started happening to me, so I knew it wasn't real and not to panic, and the trick to get out if it by slowly moving your toes and fingertips, or maybe it's because my mind isn't fully conscious? I still feel half asleep when it happens and my main focus becomes going back to sleep again lol and when it comes to uncomfortable things happening during paralysis all it does is annoy half asleep me, whereas if I was more awake I feel like I would be terrified because I would be worried my brain would make me hallucinate something really scary. 

I've also never seen a demon when I have opened my eyes (i would never open my eyes during sleep paralysis consciously btw, but half asleep me doesn't give a shiiit lol) but I have seen a cartoon ladybug (??) that dotted around my walls for a bit so uh yeah that was kinda interesting.

Anyway yeah I hope this keeps up because I don't want to end up traumatised 😬"
96,I think I've had my fist case of sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,"TL;DR: feeling of dread and pain from dream fades into reality

So, a bit of context, first, i known what SP is and the different effects it may have in different people but I've never suffered it to this point, secondly, one of my biggest fears is not being able to move ou react when in danger, it really causes me to panic. 
So to the story, it happened yesterday,  it was a night w many dreams, complex and long dreams, and after the last dream i woke up, but it was like 7:30 in the morning, since im not working neither going to school because of covid, i just went back to sleep, and i had this weird nightmare where i was at my cousin's bedroom, with other people that werent him, but i also dont remember who they were, anyways, the dream was all black and white, almost cartoonist looking, and i get a very bad felling that im being watched by something behind the door, so I go there and open it, and there is an monster, like, imagine the shape of a drop o water, but reverse, it was round where its supposed to have shoulders and gets thin at the bottom, and its face is like slenderman's, plain white, and from this moment on, i start to fell my back and ears burning in the dream, but slowly it fades to reality as i ""wake up"", when i realise that im fully awake but i cant move for shit and my back and ears are burning just like in the dream and it hurts, and i get the same felling of being watched by the door, only now i know what's behind the door, but i cant see it because i sleep belly down and facing the wall, and suddenly all stops and i get up in a jump like what was holding me down just let go.
It was weird, but didn't quite scare me like a thought it was going to be. During the experience, the moment i realized that what was happening was SP, i was calmer, and just tried to move some muscle, I've read somewhere that if u force some muscle to move, like a finger or an eye blink, u snap out of it. So that's my story, tell me what u think it might've been"
97,my fan saved me,Sleepparalysis,1,"i woke up like 2 times while sleeping but after i awoke myself the third time shit just felt like it pulled me right into a different place, and so i realized i had sleep paralysis. the funny thing about this is that i had my fan on and for some reason it sounded loud as fuck as if it was literally some avalanche falling directly onto the ground right beside me and it somehow snapped me out of it i guess?

this is my 2nd time having a really conscious SP and one thing that i know for sure is to never open my eyes because fuck me if i wanna deal with some demon trying to eat my dick or some shit"
98,Any tips on how to fall back asleep following a SP episode?,Sleepparalysis,15,"Some background info. I’ve been having sleep paralysis episodes on and off since I was a kid. They tend to be more frequent when I’m stressed out or have a lot on my mind, but I usually don’t have more than one or two a month. My episodes are usually pretty mild due to the fact that I don’t have a lot of visual hallucinations. Every now and then I will, bit they’re few and far between. My hallucinations are mostly auditory or tactile. For example, I’ll hear someone banging on my door or feel someone touch my hair. I’m pretty good at snapping out of it and waking myself up, but I haven’t mastered the art of falling back asleep. After I have an episode, I’m always so scared I’ll have another. I’ll stay up for hours just completely exhausted and fighting sleep because I’m afraid of what will happen. I usually wait until the sun comes up and then I feel comfortable enough to drift back asleep. Do y’all have any tips? I just started grad school, so I can’t keep missing out on sleep like this."
99,Sleep paralysis after listening to stories of it,Sleepparalysis,1,I’ve always know about sleep paralysis and what it was. I had never experienced it until one night. I watched a video talking about a dudes ayahuasca expirence and he got sleep paralysis for days after. Here’s the link https://youtu.be/eosN5ZKwEzQ. Anyways that same night I woke up around 6 am I couldn’t move and I was looking at my wall as a black hole was expanding. The whole time I was trying to move and scream but nothing happened. I was so scared to sleep for days after it was weird it happened right after I listening to this story.
100,I scared my fiancé this morning because I was whispering numbers while I was having sleep paralysis.,Sleepparalysis,16,"I’ve had sleep paralysis on and off for years now and last night was the first time I’ve had it in months. 

I had really bad sleep paralysis last night after having a dream I was on a boat in the dark ocean. I started to come out of the dream and my body froze while I was half awake. I couldn’t see anything in the room but I felt someone lean into my ear with the deepest voice I’ve ever heard and start whispering numbers in my ear. They sounded angry. I don’t know why but I started repeating the numbers they were saying, over and over.

Eventually I gained control of my body again and woke up to see my fiancé standing at the edge of my bed, freaked out. She was getting ready for work and she said (in her words):

“What the hell were you just doing? You were saying all these random numbers and you sounded like you were trying to summon a demon” 

I told her I was having sleep paralysis and she just kinda shrugged it off. Probably my top 3 weirdest sleep paralysis experiences I’ve ever had."
101,Scariest SP (?) episode,Sleepparalysis,5,"I have been having SP for about 6 years now, have experienced every symptom from levitating to hallucinations so I know all the steps to get myself out of an episode fast. I also experience sleep paralysis while I am not fully awake most of the time, just in a super vivid dream of being awake.

The other night I “woke up” and was laying there and could tell I was entering into a SP episode so I started to wiggle my toes and my fingers. After a while nothing changed so I assumed I was just awake and this was reality. I got up and walked into the bathroom and when I turned on the lights and looked in the mirror two SP demons were standing behind me. This immediately sent me into a panic attack and I fell down and started crawling on the ground and felt hands grabbing at my legs. After a little struggle, I just shot awake in actual reality now.

This completely disoriented me. I felt that the dream was sooo real that now reality didn’t feel real, very hard experience to explain. I ended up going into my roommates room and she just casually talked to me so I could ground myself back in reality. I went back into my room and watched a little TV then ended up falling back to sleep no problem. 

Just wanted to share this because it was truly an experience like I never had before and really shook me up."
102,"This might help, not sure tho, its just an idea",Sleepparalysis,2,"When you have sleep paralysis you see your room and some scary halucinations,right?So what happens if you wear eye cover? (i dont have sleep paralysis so i cant try, but a video was recomended on youtube, and i came up with this)"
103,SP Under control... usually.,Sleepparalysis,0,"I have had SP for as long as I could remember, possibly since a very young age. Long enough that I know how to prevent it; don't take naps during the day and don't fall asleep laying on my back. 

I haven't had an episode in over a year or so. Last night I had one of those freakish ones you read about, the seeing things kind. 

I never had one of those SP episodes when you see or hear ""demons"" or weird noises. Mine are mostly the awake feeling, hearing what's happening live and in real time, but unable to move or speak out loud.

However, last night I was laying on my side going to sleep and I opened my ""eyes"" to see a black figure standing near my window, looked like a black witch with a witches hat but no facial features. As usual, I ""screamed"" for my husband to wake me up or shake me out of it but he didn't ""hear"" or ""feel"" me move. I was stuck in SP...I was finally able to shake myself out of it and eventually went to sleep with no issues. 

I spoke to my husband the next morning and he freaked. He said, I was visited by a demon called the Hat Man, and he blamed it on me watching shows like Ghost Adventures...which I love.  He thinks that by watching shows like that I am inviting evil spirits and opening myself up. This is not the first time he has said this.  I said, absolutely no way and that was that.  

Anyone feel there is truth to that or a connection? Watching shows that involves spirits/demons and SP?"
104,Freaky sp demon,Sleepparalysis,0,"I’ve had a couple of instances where I’m n ot sure whether it were sleep paralysis or not, but I do know that this one was. My sp demon had very aggressive sex with me. It felt so weird and I had to go and talk to a school counselor about it. Weird times. This was a few months ago and I was pretty shaken up about because the guy was huge-he was built like a wwe wrestler but luckily I haven’t had another incident like that."
105,Felt like I was being sucked into a tornado,Sleepparalysis,0,"So, to start this, back in 2013 when I was fresh out of high school I worked a job that was 4-9am every day. I eventually being addicted to zzzquil because I could not fall asleep. Because of this, I would routinely have lucid dreams and/or SP. They were never really vivid enough to scare me, and I didn't think they were, or could be as scary as they potentially can be. 

Between 2013-now I haven't experienced anything except for the occasional wake up to a loud noise and feel like I was stuck, but it would quickly fade and I would be fine. 

The reason I'm posting this is because I think you guys might find it interesting. Yesterday I fell asleep at around 430am, which is common for me, as I love the night time. Around 5:30am I had an intense dream that involved me walking out to a beach, grasping a beach towel(?) Or maybe a blanket and holding it out in front of me. As I walked towards the beach, there were tons of huge tornados everywhere. I remember walking close to one, and getting the ""sucked up, floating"" and eventual perpetual freefall feeling. This woke me up into a very intense SP state. I couldn't move and I could see but just barely. My hands were grasping my blanket the same way I remember holding it in my dream. I just kept feeling like I was falling, and honestly, I felt like I was dying or having a heart attack. I haven't experienced this feeling in a long time, and it has never been that vivid. When I snapped out of it, I remember trying to walk to the bathroom, but everything looked so fuzzy, like I had water in my eye or something. 

I eventually got back in bed and just laid there, completely full on anxiety. Thankfully my wife was just about to wake up for work, so I was able to talk to her about the experience. She has never had an episode and didn't really understand what I meant, but it felt good to talk with her about it. I was able to sleep after she left. I'm about to sleep for the night and I'm just hoping it doesn't happen again. That was the most on edge I have felt in a long time.  

Anyways, that's about all I can remember. I wish I could have had my Fitbit on and has a heart rate reading, because I bet it was weird. Thank you for reading if you made it this far, and thank you for giving me a place to talk about this. It makes me feel better about the whole experience."
106,I think I just had sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,3,"I just woke up and could see my room, but nothing would move. It’s like I was staring at a still image of my room. I moved around some things like my stuffed bear, I was shaking it a bunch but it just stayed still. It’s like my eyes couldn’t actually see anything that was happening but I could feel it happening. I reached for my phone to call my mom but I obvs couldn’t see to call her, I couldn’t speak neither it was like something was holding me back. I started waving my hands infront of my eyes but still couldn’t see anything that was moving, just a still image of my bedroom the way I first saw it when I opened my eyes. I have eye problems to begin with so this freaked me out I thought my eyes were messing up. It felt very real but I’m assuming it was sleep paralysis and I was actually still asleep... although I grabbed my phone and when I finally snapped out of it my phone was in my hand. So I think I was doing the movements but I was still half asleep? I’m not sure but it was very freaky and weird."
107,my boyfriend experienced sleep paralysis and I just want to help him however I can,Sleepparalysis,8,"I’m new here, I have viewed reddit threads thru google for advice but was driven to actually get on here after this. My boyfriend smokes quite a lot of pot so he usually never remembers his dreams these days but has been able to lucid dream since he read about it at about 8 years old. He moved in with me a while ago now and I should let you know I’m a very spiritual person (he is becoming more so too) my apartment is covered in crystals, I read tarot, I burn sage/ Palo santo, etc. He has very high anxiety and recently will wake up with a weight in his chest without reason, and I’ve mentioned recently although he doesn’t remember his dreams he may still be carrying something in his subconscious through them even if he doesn’t remember. I’ve always been susceptible to nightmares but have never experienced sleep paralysis or anything like what he explained happened last night. I woke up around 4:30 AM absolutely terrified to see him making noises that sounded like he was trying to scream and was moving as though he was in like a straight jacket. I yelled “BABY!!” A couple times and had to shake him to wake him up. He woke up bawling his eyes out hyperventilating and I just did my best to comfort him and remind him he was safe, it was just a dream and everything was okay. Basically what he explained happened was we were somewhere where a friend of his had passed away, and his spirit was there, he locked eyes with the spirit and was and I quote “more scared than he’d ever been in his life, terrified”. I stayed awake until he fell asleep again (took about 2 hours) before I also fell asleep. I’m not looking for explanations as to why this happened as I don’t want to scare him more. I’m just asking for any advice on how to force himself to wake up from this kind of a thing in case it happens again/ any advice for me with regards to reassure him/ any knowledge that would alleviate his anxiety. I love him so much and felt so helpless. Thanks in advance guys I know people are very supportive here"
108,Occuring sleep paralysis/dream,Sleepparalysis,0,"I have this often, and i didnt realize it was sleep paralysis then until recently and i didnt know where to go to seek knowledge and was thinking people will dismiss it as a nightmare and laugh. But i am quite the spiritualist so i know is shouldnt happen more than twice and you dont manage to wake up and get up go toilet and go back into the same paralyisis dream/situation. And i sleep beside the window an it involves a shadow figure too, which i am not really intimidated by as sometimes i am woken up by partner while shouting and hissing at it too try scare it off as thats all i can do as i cant move at all, but few times my partner hasnt been woken up by me hissing and shouting- my ahouting at it has woken me out of it and then i see this shape by the window and at that time i am drowziness sleep and feel so powerless apart from my speech, its loud enough to wake my neighbours. Last time i was reciting with God's name like i was performing an exorcism. I take antidepressants which to be taken at night and knocks me out and thats when i experience these reoccuring events, if i dont take them my anxiety keeps me up all night and i barely get sleep! This is the first antidepressant that actually works well with me. I would be most grateful to hear a bit more and understanding. Thank you"
109,My experience in SP,Sleepparalysis,0,"Hi everyone am new here and honestly I did not know they have a SP group am glad to see theres an actual group on this subject it pleases me to see am not the only one with this problem the only thing is I dont know if I should talk about the experience I had. It all started when I was 19 I was sleeping in my bed. All of a sudden I wake up facing the mirror only to find out I could not move I saw everything normal what I could see with my eyes like a normal person would when all of a sudden from being inside my room In a blink of the eye I was seeing everything black and In front of me was a door its was far away but I knew it was a door. And in that door fire was coming out from the edges when all of a sudden the door exploded open and a lady comes out she was floating her hair floated a little like if she was under water here eyes black and hatred consumed her to a point were you could see like vapor wrapping around her like an Aurora. Honestly shes not ugly compared to other SP experiences I heard of. Shes scary by the way acts but beautiful in her appearance. She keep getting closer and closer until she floated almost next to me and I was trying to get up from the moment I saw fire around the door because I knew what was coming believe it or not. She got up to my face and smiled menacingly with a grin on her face and told me I'll always be watching you.... and I broke free of my SP. But it does not end there. I woke up scared to death,I saw my room, and i was like ok at least I woke up when all of a sudden my door of the room opens little by little and I see a black shadow of a women peeking through the door( its was almost 2am. I could tell it was a woman because of the long hair she had dangling down as she peeked through the door) and then shes closes it slowly(since I just woke up from SP I was still lightheaded so I did not care at the moment and went back to sleep after that) but as soon as I realized that I always lock my room and keep the key and copy with me I woke up ASAP, jumped out of my bed opened the door but since it was locked I just crashed into the door. Out of desperation I unlocked it and went running through the whole house. Checked the 3rd,2nd and 1st floor I even went outside to check around the neighborhood to find nobody. I was concerned. Went to my room and did not sleep all night.ever since that day I constantly have SP in a week I can have from 3 to 7 honestly I got used to it except for the last one I had like 2 weeks ago. It overwhelmed me I was shaking uncontrollably, my body felt like a earthquake never seen In the eyes of man, my jaw was moving from
Side to side.up and down, literally my body felt like it was trying to be controlled... and I think it did because I was still in SP but I saw myself get out of bed dragging myself to the door and when i opened everything was dark( and that's weird cuz it was 5:30pm) i could only see what was in front of me. Honestly I only have fragments of what I did but I saw my dog go up to me like always when All of a sudden she started to whine like an Afraid puppy and went up stairs all I heard was her whining and crying on the second floor. My body felt soo heavy I could not move.  when I woke up I felt like Sh** extreme pain in my bones and muscles I even woke up disoriented for like 3 hours. But after that I haven't had one.... at least for now"
110,Why do I have sleep paralysis everyday?,Sleepparalysis,3,"I’ve been struggling with SP for all my life and now it is effecting my marriage. Every night I am intensely shaking, tossing around, making weird noises. Some nights I have SP maybe 20-30 times. 
   When I was a teenager, I was trying to have lucid dreams. Dreams was so vivid for a while I couldn’t wait for getting to bed and dreaming my best life. I know it is sounds weird but dreams was more exiting than my life at that time. So, question is what is the relation with lucid dreaming and SP? Maybe, I am triggering it subconsciously while I am going into REM sleep I am forcing myself to awaken?I wonder why do I have this condition. I just wanted to hear other if you guys can relate.

    I wanted to go to sleep study but I don’t have insurance for now."
111,First Experience? Thoughts?,Sleepparalysis,0,"I don't know how to to start this off or even if this was sleep paralysis. But this happened a couple months ago.

I was sleeping well trying to sleep. I felt extremely tired, so tired and had this sensation feeling of tiredness all over me but I for some reason couldn't sleep? I tosses and turned, went on and off on my phone then it happened.

For some short period of time I was asleep I cant recall how long but it was really short, I need woke up tired, wondering why I woke up. I dont remeber exactly what happened I was moving around etc finally got to sleep again.


While I was sleep, Im not entirely sure I was completely asleep this time? I kept hearingg something? Thought maybe it was the curtain banging up again the window but idk. Then i saw a face which scared me.shitless. it was wearing a white mask. 

But this time something weird happened. It felt like my whole body was shutting down, my heart was racing abnormally fast like it was about to pop out of my chest. I was concerned, and honestly thought I was going to die. I saw the white face, I tried my best to move. I trief to get up realised I couldnt, then trird to move at least my arm. Well I couldn't and thoight I was dying or having a heart attack so i started to fight harder because I didnt want my parents to find me deaf in the morning (I have a fear of dying in mu sleep). I stopped because it was useless, I was scared shitless and thought that was that. Im noy sure how long this went for. I woke up the next morning.

The white mask felt a presence to me, I felt as the room got colder and hearing things which didnt help.


I havnt gotten anything since or never."
112,There's a woman that torments me.,Sleepparalysis,14,"She has long black greasy hair, her arms and legs are like 3-4ft long, her eyes bulge yellow, and she has like, lots of horses teeth almost, she has a torn white dress. And she always stands in the same place, facing away from me hyperventilating.  Then I sit on my bed and feel her face on the side of mines. I only wake up when I look at her and she screams. I always need a few minutes to catch my breath.  I havent slept in around 3 days now. Im so tired"
113,Dreaming during SP?,Sleepparalysis,4,"Ok, so I’ve experienced Sleep Paralysis a handful of times. I used to say that I experience to often, but I’m starting to think that I don’t, that maybe it’s something else? Or maybe it’s just some different version of it.

Whenever I did experience sleep paralysis, I would be in the stages of waking up. For example, I fell asleep while studying, and when I woke up, I heard someone downstairs cleaning/putting away dishes. I tried to get up but realised I couldn’t, and started panicking. Then I heard someone come up the stairs, and come into the room that I was asleep in. At this stage I woke up, only to discover that no one was in the room, or the house even. And none of the dishes I had to sort out were dealt with. All of the other times were similar to this. 

But other times, I’ve experienced something somewhat similar while actually going to sleep rather than waking up. Take last night, for example. I was laying there, waiting to drift off when I felt myself entering a dream. But I was still conscious. It’s literally like going through some veil and entering the dream world. the dreams would be very vivid, and I would feel everything. I mean everything, to the point of pain. The more I would try to force myself out of the dream and to wake up, the more aggressive the dream would get. And the more my body wouldn’t move. I’d feel myself tensing and trying to move both in the dream and physically but nothing would happen. When I do manage to wake, I’m groggy as though I had been fast asleep, tense, and usually pins and needles. If someone had grabbed me or anything in the dream, there would be an ache there.

I had believed that this was sleep paralysis as I feel very awake, I can’t move, I’d barely be able to breath with the pressure on my chest, and it’s usually a nightmare. I remember each and every ‘dream’ I’ve had during these moments. But the thing is, I’m dreaming. My eyes aren’t open.

Last night it happened 3 times while I tried to go to sleep. To the point I considered not sleeping at all. I know I won’t sleep properly tonight, worried it will happen again. Each time it happened, it was as though I was going back into the same dream space, and whoever was in the dream was waiting for my return. I’ve often got pissed off when this happens. In reality and my mind. All I’d want is to actually sleep, dream, even have a typical nightmare if it came to it. But being ‘awake’ in the dream is beyond scare and frustrating. And I feel like I’m going nuts because of it. I’ve even argued with my own mind during one of these to leave me alone because all I wanted was to get a proper nights sleep. 

I’ve noticed when I did have sleep paralysis before that I’d have aces and pains after from being so tense, but with this, it’s as though I feel everything that happens me. Last night, for example, something was rubbing my back. But when I tried to leave the dream and open my eyes, it started to increase in pressure until the point I felt as though I had been jabbed or stabbed. That area still feels sore if I rub it.

Has anyone here who suffers with Sleep Paralysis experienced this? Or something similar? I’ve tried looking it up and it all related back to it being that. But I’m not sure. I always believed that I’d be awake, eyes open, if it was sleep paralysis. Not awake with my eyes closed in a very vivid dream like state.

I’ve also considered that it’s simply a nightmare, but I’ve had those also and it would usually wake me up, with little memory of what really happened in it. I wouldn’t be entering it with a very clear mind.

I did look at the top post about knowing what SP actually is because a lot of people question it and if they have it, but I’m just not sure if this is some form of it or something more.

Update: I’ll also note that after this happens, when I get out of the dream, I would go through a very mild version of actual SP, but it only lasts for a few moments. My body would be rigid, but because I’d been fighting to get out of the dream space, I’m still pushing to move once I’m in SP so it never lasts too long. Though that depends on how bad the dream was."
114,My experience with sp,Sleepparalysis,1,"I used to have SP since my early teens,at first it was terrifying , some say that sleeping on your back attracts it ( always slept on my stomach ),and i had it quiet often, before having it the first symptoms of it would be goosebumps and weird sensation in my lungs , i feel like getting dragged from my bed to the bathroom vividly and sometimes losing gravity and floating towards the ceiling , also i feel like screaming for help but I cannot talk and my anxiety is going through hell , i get auditory hallucinations of cars and motorbikes nearby but there is none but with time i got used to it and it was quite fun a bit. I used to get it once a week or twice for quite sometime but now I haven’t had an episode for about 4-8 months. I started sleeping on my back a year ago. 

For everyone going through this, it will pass and eventually you will get used to it and maybe use it recreationally haha!"
115,Confusing reality with dreams,Sleepparalysis,2,"I’ve had troubles with sleep paralysis since I was little. I also frequently lucid dream and I’ll wake up feeling more tired like I was running around for hours. Usually when I wake up from a dream it feels so real that I wake up scared and confused and don’t know where I am at first. And then I’ll have this feeling like I was ripped out of somewhere I should have been and I’m not where I’m supposed to be. It’s not every night, but it does occur enough to upset my days. Some dreams will linger with me the whole day. 

Tonight I had a lucid dream as usual but passed out whilst in my dream causing me to go in to some strange state where everything went black but I was conscious and fully awake, but I couldn’t move and I started lifting from the bed and spinning. Obviously this is all in my head and I was in fact imagining this but it feels so real like I was being lifted. 

Honestly just looking for some similar experiences to make sure I’m not losing my mind.

Edit: I also forgot to add how lightheaded I feel after waking up. Especially tonight, it felt like my brain was thrown back in to my head. I’ll be so lightheaded that I can’t really move at first and it’ll take a bit to get my strength back. Even after I’m able to move and begin comprehending my surroundings, My head will feel like I was on a rollercoaster"
116,Calm Sleep Paralysis EPS,Sleepparalysis,3,"Last year, sleep paralysis was common for me. The majority of them were me laying on my side then floating above my bed, then going back down. 

A common thing that happened during my episodes is my feet would move slowly as if I was doing tippy toes but backwards towards me

Despite having so many SP, I’ve yet to encounter a SP Demon. The only “creature” I’ve encountered was when I woke up to a mouse sniffing my ear and moving around my bed. 

Does this mean anything?"
117,My SP last night effected the real world somehow,Sleepparalysis,43,"I should preface this with 2 things. 1st, I regularly take naps in my car during my lunch break. I work 3rd shift so that should normally be around 4am. 2nd, I often record my dreams and regularly have lucid dreams. This felt very different to that.

In the last 2 weeks, I've had sp twice during my lunch break nap out in the parking lot. The first time, just last week was quite odd by itself. When I first noticed I was experiencing so, I also noticed a presence behind me. I convinced myself through the horror of that, that this must be a dream and as such willed myself to move. Out first, I couldn't, and I tried quite a bit. Soon after stopping my initial attempt though, I had this feeling that something was being pulled from the top of my head, and this terrified me. I didn't need to think about it, I just got out of my car and started running. It was odd to me because this wasn't my first time with sp, and I thought for certain that I wouldn't be able too, but no less, I managed it. About 10 ft or so from my car though, I felt this physical barrier. It seemed to stretch all around my car, even though the parking lot was empty. 

With no where else to run, I decided to turn around and face my SP demon. Much to my surprise though, it just wasn't there. It's presence was gone and I couldn't feel it anymore. I saw something much more horrifying though. With my car door still open, I could see a black mass lying in the seat. It wasn't motionless either. Though it stayed in place it's appearance was animated black, with a surface like a violent, turbulent ocean. I understood it better asleep than I did awake, and just started crying until I eventually woke up. I did in fact, wake up back in my car.

The second happened last night. I fell asleep and immediately noticed it. This time a presence was in the back seat directly behind me. I tried doing what I did last time. I recalled the feeling I had of something being pulled from the top of my head, and began trying to move. I only managed to turn my head this time. I saw, out of the passenger window towered a silver truck.(all vehicles tower over mine, I drive a tiny Ford Fiesta) Im more than certain there was no truck there before sleep as I park pretty far out of the way, I don't like being near people while unconscious after all. Before I could look anywhere else though, from the center of my back I felt something pull me into the seat.

I thought this is where I'd wake up because I was still in the car, but it wasn't yet. My arms were now crossed like a mummy and the presence behind me began to speak. It sound like a sultry woman, but slightly more innocent. She said ""What you did and we're trying to do again is very dangerous, for both you and for me. I won't be permitting you to do so again."" I was more scared now than I was the first time. I felt like the SP had happened in my dream and that this woman had sort of imprisoned me by pulling me into an even deeper layer of the dream. It scared me to think that she had more control than me in my own dream. I felt like I was literally tied to the seat, not unable to move, just physically prevented from escaping.

The woman leaned over the back seat a d started choking me from behind. She continued to speak, but I just couldn't comprehend most of the words. She seemed somewhat upset, but also angered, like she was threatened by me in some way as though I had done something to her. As she ranted on, her voice became more hoarse, and I could tell she was choking back more than a few words. The few sentences I could make out we're: ""Don't you dare hurt her,"" ""You better not fuck this up,"" and something along the lines of ""won't let her do it again."" 

At this point I wasn't just having trouble breathing, I was actually coughing and gasping trying desperately to breathe at all. As I feel like she's finally about to kill me, she lets go of my neck with the words: ""...but it's not my place to judge you yet. I will see you again but only after what you're going to do."" She disappears. I could sorta see her before, I could make out her hair and the outline of her figure while she was reaching over me, but now she was gone. Practically turned to dust. I awoke soon after at 4:16am.

As I went to head back inside, I turned around to lock my door and panicked. I thought blood was spattered on my door. It turned out it was just a few berries crushed against it though.(I didn't think to take a picture right away, but I got what was left of it after cleaning most of it. It was regrettably smudged though) I did a walk around and noticed 2 hand prints on the rear passenger door. No one using it. I use the car exclusively for work and never have passengers.

Anyway, I'm terrified of this, ofc, but have any of you guys had similar experiences? Can I even call it SP since I did manage to move out first? Either way, I took pics of the berry smudge and hand prints when daylight permitted. You couldn't see them in the dark to well, so links to that in the comments

EDIT: I should've noted that there is no woman in my life she could be referring to. I only work and sleep, and boy do I like my sleep

EDIT 2: it seems like a lot of people are forgetting how my car was effected. I know my phone camera doesn't pick it up well, but what do you think of the hand marks in my car? To me they seem stretched out, like what children do in finger painting, which concerns me alot. My windows were open too, so if anything wanted to get in, it easily could. I feel like my car was intentionally marked."
118,I just had the strangest most vivid sleep paralysis in my life.,Sleepparalysis,9,"Holy crap... I fell asleep at on my boyfriends couch (he’s away right now, in another state). I woke up, unable to move and I then realize, okay I’m having sleep paralysis. This happens to me a lot, so I’m kind of used to it. But then, by boyfriend walks in the door and kisses me on the check... what the fuck. Still unable to move, I just close my eyes hoping my body will wake up soon. When I close my eyes, I heard voices.. I couldn't make out what they were saying, or i at least don't remember what was said. I opened my eyes and noticed someone’s legs sitting crisscrossed to the left of me... low key freaked the fuck out in my head and was telling myself not to look at its face because well, its not real. Well I look at this fuckers face and just LOL... It was a horses head on someone’s freaking body.. like looking down at me. Lmaoo then things got so strange.. I must have been really falling into a dream state because I swear I touched it and felt it (this made me panic more cause I was like wait.. is this real?). Next I start trying really really hard to move my body and wake up. I picked up my hands and put them in front of my face... it felt like I was actually moving again... but my arms were still at my side and weird white squiggly outlines of my hands was in front of me. Like I was leaving my body. Then I look to the left and the horse guy found a friend.. she weirdly looked my friend Jenna. Finally, after what felt like hours of hallucinating (It was probably 10 minutes tbh), I jolted up and screamed. It was an accident to scream out loud but I was trying so hard during everything to make words that it just happened. I do remember being able to say ""help me"" at one point and I tried breathing really heavy to wake up. Meanwhile all this was happening, my boyfriends dogs were running around the couch playing. I guess made it feel more real.. like everything in the home was normal, except for these visitors. Does anyone know why this actually happens? This happens to me about once a week, and if i nap 100% of the time it will happen. This just happened to be the most intense times I had it and I felt the need to write it out."
119,Sp visited me while napping in the car,Sleepparalysis,4,"I work at a hotel on the beach and we have to park in a parking garage. I was especially tired after working a double, 10 am to 11 pm and i live an hour away from home. I felt like i was too tired to drive so i decided to park all the way at the top, where no one ever parks, and take a small nap in the backseat of my Chevy cavalier before i drove home. I woke up frozen, feeling like there was someone sitting on my chest with their hands around my neck. It felt like someone was pushing my car up and down and shaking it from side to side. I have a 2005 Chevy cavalier it’s a tiny car and doesn’t take much pressure to make it bounce. I heard Male voices outside my car and saw shadows but i couldn’t understand what they were saying. I could hear them yelling at me inaudibly still shaking my car i felt completely paralyzed and i couldn’t even move my eyes. Someone slammed on the car hard and yelled WAKE THE FUCK UP BITCH. I sat up drenched in sweat the car was fogged up and no one was in vicinity"
120,My SP (I think) Experiences,Sleepparalysis,2,"So, I’m currently 15 turning 16 later this month. A few days ago I’m pretty sure I had my first sp experience. The day before it I had set an alarm for 7:45AM because I wanted to watch a stream that started at 8:00AM. I ended up finishing it but since I woke up at 7:45, I was still tired so I decided to go to sleep. Then I wake up to this feeling that a dog was breathing rapidly on my nose and mouth and I couldn’t move. I don’t remember much but my fingers weighed a million pounds, and in this state somehow I knew this was some type of sleep paralysis but I wasn’t scared, just really weirded out. 

My second time though happened about 30-40 minutes ago. I woke up at around 8:30AM today so when 5:00PM came around, I felt tired and wanted to nap. Once I had drifted off, I woke up to a slight pain (unrelated to sp). When the pain subsided, I checked the time (5:56PM) and drifted off once more. I awaken to the same feeling of a dog breathing on my nose/mouth and my fingers weighing a ton, except this time it felt as if I was getting goosebumps in my ear canal. There’s really no way to explain it well but it felt like the inside of my ears were shivering/twitching really fast, and it would come every few seconds. This whole experience was weird because I didn’t know if I was awake or asleep because I could still hear my neighbors children playing outside, but I was paralyzed. After it was over, I checked the time once more and it was 6:04PM. 


I tried to search up what was happening to my ears but I couldn’t find anything on the web so I came to Reddit. Has anyone else experienced this ear canal twitching/shaking/shivering feeling or does anyone know what it is?


Edit: I forgot to mention that when I had my first experience, I was at my aunts house and she owns a dog, but the door to the room I was sleeping in was shut so there was no way it was breathing on me. I later confirmed this because my second experience happened in my house and I do not own a dog."
121,My experience,Sleepparalysis,0,"About a week ago I got sp for the first time in a looong time. I felt this woman that I dont know reach out and touch my back and speak, couldnt move.
Yesterday, Aug 12, exhausted from work I heard this incredibly loud ringing and I couldnt move. When it was over it started again.
I think I will add edits if something like this happens again so I can see a pattern. I hope nothing happens. It's too terrifying."
122,"A UFO, pizza man, and a head",Sleepparalysis,3,"This happened a few years ago and it was one of the scariest moments in my life. 
(I am also on mobile so sorry for any weirdness)

I was laying in my grandparents basement and they have a couple of those small half windows just at ground level so it only lets in a bit of light. I had a few episodes of sleep paralysis before so when I woke up and couldn’t move I knew what it was. Then I started hearing a deep, constant wubbing and I see a beam of light going through the windows. And I am FREAKED OUT. 
After the light passes I hear someone at the other side of the room ordering a pizza and then I hear a pizza man coming down the stairs (I have closed my eyes at this point) and I hear him give the pizza to the man who ordered it. And as soon as he got the pizza the pizza man took out some kind of blade and decapitated the head of the guy who ordered it. My heart was pounding so hard as I heard the head hit the floor. The pizza man then grabbed the head off the ground and I know this because he started walking over to me so slowly and I could hear the blood dripping from the head getting closer and closer. And as he approached the couch I was laying on I could hear him breathing close to my ear and suddenly I opened my eyes and moved my hands and it was over. 

TLDR: A UFO lit up the basement; a pizza man showed up and decapitated the customer and approached me."
123,My body was remote controlled - SP or AP?,Sleepparalysis,1,"I was using a YT video to help me Astral project last night.

I didn't notice falling asleep, I felt conscious the whole time.

However, at one point my body started to move on its own with my head hanging down and sitting up in bed and about to stand up, I didn't understand what was happening to me and was overthinking, because I was not the one moving my limbs. And I didn't know what my body was about to do next. 

And taking in my surroundings I suddenly noticed a third hand somehwhat bigger than mine touching me and moving my body. I got scared and bit the hand really hard. 

A bit later I think I woke up lying in bed."
124,"Do Western beliefs produce more ""hellish"" SP nightmares? What about Eastern beliefs?",Sleepparalysis,32,"A therapist I spoke with about this said that almost all of his clients who grew up in traditional Western religions more often encountered ""demonic"" type characters in dreams, while the ones from Eastern backgrounds did not...  Could that disparity comes from western religion's emphasis on heaven, hell, judgement, guilt? 

For example, my SP nightmare was a devil face which hovered over my bed and seemed to paralyze, suffocate, and inflict intense pain on me for about a half hour.  The therapist suggested that this figure was based on the religious ideas I grew up with.  That made some sense to me but I'd like to cross check that because my one experience was extremely intense. 

So I'm really curious if anyone on this sub, from a non-Western culture, has had a demonic or devil type beings terrorize you in your dreams?"
125,My first experience of sleep paralysis (I think?),Sleepparalysis,0,"Ok so I'm nearly 17 years old (in a couple months) and just earlier this night at about 3 am or so I got pretty tired so I tried to go to sleep, I tossed and turned like I usually do to get to sleep, and once I found a comfortable position I closed my eyes and started to drift away into sleep mode whilst thinking of things about life. I can't say exactly when it occured it kinda just happened but all of a sudden I ""almost?"" Woke up but my eyelids were flickering I couldn't move, but I could breathe. 

Then (I don't know how many people know this game) but SCP containment breach the SCP 0-96 ( This is it:  https://youtu.be/QBBh-b1g-3A)   

I could hear its scream inside my head and I heard thundering footsteps and I kid you not I thought I was going to die so I started trying to do anything possible to move and then all of a sudden BAM I died, jk. I could move my eyes freely and the screaming and footsteps went away and then I regained full control after that. Well that is my story, I don't actually know if it was sleep paralysis or some crazy dream but all I know is that I was in fact concious when hearing the scream and footsteps. 
Also any opinions on if my guess is correct or not of it being sleep paralysis?"
126,2 different SPish experiences,Sleepparalysis,1,"So, I was dreaming. That was a strange dream but nothing special and I struggle to remember a whole picture. Only thing I can recall is the wood house, that is all. At one moment I started waking up and I was like.. shite man I am lucid dreaming... but it went wrong. My consciousness sucked out from the dream and entered a dark state, just the voidness around. I knew my body was laying on the bed and my mind was somewhere else, so I started calming myself. like.. maann, you know what is going on, you are awake but your mind is caged in the place it’s lost control on the body... and I reclaimed calmness and that was pretty odd. But soon enough my whole body started vibrating inside, it was so intense i thought i was gonna dematerialize. I kinda freaked out and one thought occurred to me.... move... just try to move. Because I was kinda scared.. not scared actually. It was indeed a strange feeling. And i tried.... But I failed.. once again I told myself.. You knew you would fail and just do not freak out further. So I got myself calmed and later I had a feeling I woke up completely. Suddenly some uncontrollable emotion forced me to jump out of the bed and start screaming, but I did not play that game. I maintained the position on the bed and continued sleeping. 
Strange thing is that I experienced something I thought was SP before. Let me tell that story too. Couple of years ago I woke up and felt a presence of the most evil creature on earth. I saw a silhouette but not really.. it was feeling that this creature was standing right next to my bed. I have never felt that overwhelmed. This creature was the evilness itself. And I got so scared I jumped from the bed and broke out from my room by destroying the doors. I was screaming.. scream of fear.. scream of terror.. scream so strong that one only can produce when seeing a devil."
127,Cute sleep paralysis demon,Sleepparalysis,2,"It's a classic story. You wake up, you can't move and you start hearing weird sounds and seeing men/monster shaped shadows. Well, tonight i saw a cat sleeping on me. It was so cute"
128,Another episode,Sleepparalysis,0,"So I tend to get/have sleep paralysis up to 2 or 3 times per year, it always seems to be a shadowy figure that's standing next to my bed or hovers over me. I never really knew what triggered it, but last night it happened again and I remember lying there with this figure stood in my room and I was breathing so rapidly. I always seem to try to gasp for help, last night was no different but I can't get my words out, kind of sounds like trying to hum with my mouth open. I've been feeling a little anxious over the last couple of days because I've been waiting on higher education assessment results, so I'm not sure if that has triggered it? Either way, it's a pretty crazy experience and it's good to know that I'm not the only one that experiences it!"
129,I played myself and triggered sp,Sleepparalysis,5,"I hadn't had sp in a while and thought I was safe... WRONG. I ignored several red flags and really brought this episode upon myself.

I foolishly decided that last night at midnight would be a great time to watch The Haunting Of Hill House, a truly terrifying show IMO. One of the characters in the show experiences sleep paralysis *RED FLAG* 

My sleep meditation app then lulled me into a false sense of security and told me to sleep on my back, which I did despite it being a sp trigger *RED FLAG* 

My dreams started off relatively normal before morphing into the plot of Hill House where I became the character with sp. It was truly a mistake to watch this show.

My immobilized ass stared passively at my closet where the shadows morphed into monsters and crept towards me... I finally woke up whisper-screaming after what felt like hours (this happens every time - why do I always think screaming will help?). My dog was quite alarmed by my whisper-screams but mostly in a ""why have you disturbed my slumber"" kind of way. 

I don't know why I didn't put 2 & 2 together and realize that I had created the perfect recipe for my own terror and distress...

Has anyone else triggered sp by watching a movie/TV show?"
130,My crazy sleep paralysis story I wrote when I woke up in the middle of the night (levitation),Sleepparalysis,2,"
Before I went to sleep I was lying there and imagining me in football and people just running at me and hitting me and I kept jolting and panicking almost sounds like ptsd and then when I finally went to sleep I suddenly opened my eyes couldn’t move didn’t panic because this has happened to me multiple times but this was way worse. but I tryed to just fall back to sleep without trying to get out of it but then I opened my eyes because I couldn’t then my eyes forced shut somehow and I could feel both my legs levitate and start to take my body with me but I prayed and they slowly went back down the whole time I was prayed a prayer that is gods prayer that I don’t even know but I knew it was gods prayer in my sleep but not when I woke up I forgot the whole prayer it was something about repent for my sins is all I remember and then my eyes opened again and still couldn’t move for a while then suddenly came back to regular. I didn’t ever freak out but it’s definitely sketchy. Oh and a few minutes later I hear a reoccurring low pitch beep going kind of fast like less than a second at a time outside never heard before in my life."
131,3rd person perspective,Sleepparalysis,6,"So my s/o said that she gets sleep paralysis every night. and that she can sometimes see herself sleeping and a figure. She says her eyes are closed but she can still see everything around her, she can't open her eyes, move, or talk, and she feels like it lasts for an hour. When I asked her about being able to see the figure if her eyes are closed but she said her mind recreates her room (this is where she sees herself sleeping). Then I asked her to describe being able to see herself sleeping. And she said, she wakes up but she feels like she's unable to move, and then she described being able to see herself sleeping like some sort of 3rd person video game, but she can feel everything around her, and if she falls asleep with a tv on she can hear the tv but it looks like it's off, and if there's a window, everything is black, she also says that the light is off but she can see everything perfectly fine, and then the figure sits in the corner staring at her, but she can't see its face (there's 2 corners it likes to sit in but the edge of her bed is also an option for it). I've never had sleep paralysis so I don't know what to say, or what it's like, but I want to get her help. She doesn't want medication or therapy though."
132,I saw myself during sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,5,"I’ve experienced sleep paralysis countless times now. My most intense moments were when I felt someone grab me and say “I’m always watching you” (I kinda laughed during this as it’s a inside joke with myself) and when I felt myself having sleep paralysis I opened my eyes a baby screamed straight in my face and walked of. 

However this moment disturbed me the most weirdly enough. I was having sleep paralysis opened my eyes and I just saw myself opposite me fast asleep. Didn’t move or say anything just sleeping. 

I’m not sure why I saw myself but idk why but it’s just doesn’t sit right with me. I feel as if there is some underlying meaning. Anyone have any thoughts or similar experiences?"
133,When/How often do you get sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,5,"Just had my first SP episodes in a while and I was curious to see when/how often other people get SP!

For me, I usually get SP when waking up, especially when I wake up earlier than I should/want to. Sometimes I end up falling back asleep after a while lol. A few years ago though, I used to get SP when I was falling asleep. Thankfully, I don't get SP that often, maybe once every few months, but when I do, they always seem to come in clusters - like I'd get them two or three days in a row. Also, weirdly enough, I don't seem to get SP when I'm away at college, but I used to get them in high school and now, since I'm back at home."
134,Whispering in my ear,Sleepparalysis,3,"The other night my sleep paralysis was telling me to kill myself.. Has anyone else ever experienced that? It felt so real & I remember thinking ""I need to remember this in the morning because it was so real"" Or maybe it was an evil spirit? Who knows"

136,Wondering if I’m the only one or not that doesn’t have visual hallucinations during SP.,Sleepparalysis,7,"I’ve been having sleep paralysis since I was about 7 or 8. My poor brain didn’t know how to handle this. I didn’t know what it was. It was a time way before google, so I came up with the one thing that it could have been; aliens.  I came to that conclusion because I watched a movie about aliens ( Fire in the Sky), and there is a part where they cover something on the guy that make it so he can’t move. The only difference I could tell between him and me in that small part  on the movie is that my eyes couldn’t open at all. I could never open them during  all of my episodes. This is still the case for me. I certainly do have auditory hallucinations and that ever present feeling of someone standing next to my bed or over me, watching me. I just wonder if anyone else has the same thing. 
Thank goodness that we had internet, even dial up, when I became a teen. I found out what I was actually experiencing."
137,My First Cases (i think),Sleepparalysis,0,"Hello everyone, i think i’ve been experiencing my first cases of sleep paralysis but honestly can not pin point if it is that ..
Some brief information on myself before i explain my experience is that i’m in my early 20’s, i have only just recently gotten over a marajuana addiction (been a week sober) and please don’t judge. Also this has never happened to me before until i had quit ..

What’s happened isn’t to the extent of seeing someone/something in my room, i haven’t heard voices or breathing, and it has happened to me whilst laying on my side/stomach.

So what’s happened is 3 times tonight where i’ve tried to get some sleep, i have felt my eyes under my eyelids start to go crazy with movement, i then started hearing this noise which sounded like an old 80’s sci-fi teleportation/warping sound (it’s hard to explain what exactly i heard), which wasn’t loud the first 2 times but on the 3rd time it was so loud i could barely hear myself think.. and then i am unable to move or open my eyes for a solid 45 seconds to a minute .. i am completely aware in these moments and it seems i can only break free once i mentally say to myself “1, 2, 3” and then rip my arm in the air very intensely, beacause if i tried slowly i just wasn’t able to move anything ..

If anyone can help me with what this is or how to help then please let me know, low key freaking out but i know this sort of stuff happens to a lot of people. Thank you !"
138,"Has anyone else been ""physically"" choked by the shadow man?",Sleepparalysis,13,"Last time I had sp I had the shadow man trying to choke and kill me. He jumped at me very quickly and put his hands around my neck. I could feel the sense of pressure, this lasted for 10 seconds or so but it was very scary.

Anyone else experience this?"
139,Anyone’s eyes constantly rolling back during SP?,Sleepparalysis,1,"Hi all. First post on this sub. This has been happening to me for about 5 years now. It’s very rare for me (tends to only happen if I fall asleep on a couch, chair, etc. somewhere other than a bed.) at first I thought it was just a dream until I started piecing it together that It’s always a POV from where I fell asleep. 

I’ll “wake up” with my eyes rolling back very rapidly. It feels like I just drank a whole bottle of vodka or something, like I’m extremely intoxicated and have lost control of my body/eye balls. (Keep in mind, I rarely drink anymore, and when I do it’s not much.) in this state I will try to stand up and walk around, and sometimes I feel like I’ve actually stood up from where I was lying down. The problem is, once I’ve moved to a new spot I will be sent right back to where it began. All the while my eyes are still repeatedly rolling back. 

Eventually I will snap out of it. Time seems to not exist in this state. I wouldn’t be able to tell you how long this can or has gone on in the past. I always wake up covered in sweat after one of these experiences. And it leaves me in this state of panic and anxiety for the next few hours. 

I’m not sure if this is considered SP or not. I’ve been doing some research on it, and I haven’t seen or heard of anyone experiencing anything similar to it. I’d love to hear some thoughts if anyone has any idea on what exactly is happening to me. Thanks for the help, guys!"
140,Back from another terrific sp episode,Sleepparalysis,1,"[Latest story with some background sp experience info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/hhq83o/still_scared_af_despite_being_well_used_to_it/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

So since last time I've done like a few more but nothing crazy.  Lately im actually not afraid  to sleep on my back and to have small sp...

Went to bed again drunk and high.. woke up at 5am because of the heat and was not able to sleep until 7-8.. I start to feel asleep on my back and hear screams, I feel the sp is coming so I immediately turn to be on my side cause it's supposed to be safer... And immediately it starts... 

Extremely strong classic feeling of having something or someone on top of me crushing me and pushing me. However, I feel like I'm able to move (which was I think part of the hallucinations) so I'm not feeling like I'm in sp, esp because I'm on my side. I'm thinking I'm just hallucinating.. but I can move so that's not sp.. the fact I think i might not be in sp makes the whole thing scarier. This thing keeps crushing me very hard. 

I was dreaming/hallucinating that I was in my bed but it was not my room. It was my old kid bedroom at my father's house back to the time I was in the same room as my brother. This room comes back a lot in my dreams/sp and this is where I had my first scary sp experience (see previous story).
But my eyes were open and I could actually visualize what I had in front of me in my current room. So yeah  purely sp. 

So this thing keeps crushing me it really last for a crazy long time. I also hear some bestial breathing. I feel a hand under my linen and I decide to take it. The hands defo feels like a monster hand, and  It shakes mine very strongly while still crushing me. I decided to try to throw myself out of my bed and also try to wake up my brother by screaming, I did feel like I was flying on top of my bed until like 2 metres from it, getting closer from my brother but then I'm back to my bed like a magnet.

After this, I think I went back to dream deeply cause I felt like I could turn to the other side and found someone next to me. Not a demon tho just a person I know it became gross and it triggered the awakening (on the other side)

I never had such a long episode with so much confusion and uncertainty about the fact I could actually move but still having all the sp symptoms.
I'm grateful my brain decided to end the experience like that and not making me see a demon next to me or I think I'd be traumatized again...
Until I think I turned to the other side it really felt fucking real 

See you soon for more sp adventures"
141,Felt like there was an earthquake during an episode,Sleepparalysis,3,"Has this every happened to anyone else? I just joined the sub and I’ve been having a lot of sleep paralysis episodes lately, just the usual creepy person staring at me from across the bed or being squashed. This time, however, was much different. I actually felt like an earthquake was happening. My ears were ringing to badly it began to make me want to scream and everything looked as if it was falling and shaking around. I realized I couldn’t move so it must be sleep paralysis. I just closed my eyes super tight until I woke up, which took a little bit of time. I have NEVER felt more scared in my life, I was so powerless to do anything and thought for a second I was actually stuck in my body during an earthquake."
142,how do i induce sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,6,i've never experienced sleep paralysis and i want to put myself to the test (built different)
143,Did I just have SP?,Sleepparalysis,5,"Sorry for the basic question, I'm just not sure if this counts? I've never had it before, but I have heard about it. I'll just explain what happened.

I was having a dream where I was imagining this teacher at my school talking about sports, when I suddenly ""rewinded"" what he said to better fit what he would have said irl. But then I started to be a bit more aware in my dream (I've never lucid dreamed before either).

Before I could realize that I was more aware, I opened my eyes. I had this sense that somebody had just walked into my room. I told myself it was just in my head since sometimes I get that feeling when I imagine that happening.

I closed my eyes again, and I started to feel the air above my face get different? It was like I was losing feeling in my face. I opened my eyes again and tried to look at the door in my room.

I couldn't move my body. I tried moving my face and I was able to move my jaw. I took full advantage over the little bit of movement I could make and started moving my jaw a lot trying to ""wake up"" the rest of my body.

It actually worked? I'm not sure if that was a coincidence or not, but after I moved my jaw for a few seconds I could move again. I sat up and immediately looked at my door. My muscles even hurt a little bit after, not sure if that is related.

I ask if this was actually SP because I wasn't sure if I just just dreamed all of that or not? Plus I didn't have any of those hallucinations people talk about (thank goodness).

I read that post on this subreddit that explained SP for people like me, but I still wonder because I didn't really fit *all* of the criteria. Anyway, I really hope somebody can help. I'm sorry if I'm wasting anyone's time, and thanks for reading."
144,Sleep paralysis/lucid dream crossover?,Sleepparalysis,8,"I had the strangest episode last night, where I had a dream that I had been drugged at my own birthday party. I was at a massive cabin and it had my family, friends, coworkers, old teachers and random acquaintances. I remember feeling very over stimulated by the sheer amount of people in my dream.

My family and friends were trying to help me walk, but I kept collapsing and dropping my purse and my belongings. I remember feeling actual embarrassment and I woke up slightly and couldn’t move my body. 

I fell back asleep into the same dream. Continuing on, I received gifts from old high school/college professors. I have been out of school for 5 years now, so I found that odd.

My stomach started hurting in my dream and I woke up and actually made it to my restroom. I was still feeling very sedated as if I was in my dream—the usual intense “panic” of sleep paralysis was masked, but still present under the surface.  

I fell back asleep into the same dream yet again, and was told I was delirious and needed to rest. So there I was, watching myself sleep in my dream. 

I’ve had extreme sleep paralysis dreams and lucid dreams, but this is the first time that they have crossed over. It almost felt like I was traveling to a separate dimension?"
145,Sleep paralysis & false awakening,Sleepparalysis,4,"So I suffered with sleep paralysis on and off for years. I've not had it recently, but I've been having having false awakenings maybe once or twice a month. Last night I seemed to have both at the same time. Crazy hallucinations in my room ( Some big weird demonic bird sitting in the corner of my room, and some rat like demon trying to pull my arm off), but then waking up thinking everything's fine but realising I was still unable to move and then the exact same hallucinations started again. This felt like it looped for hours. I'd actually taken some valium before going to sleep as I'd literally not slept for 3 days due to anxiety. Thought it would help but obviously not haha! I wasn't too stressed though but that's probably due to the valium I guess."
146,Sleep paralysis 6 times in one night,Sleepparalysis,6,"I have never experienced more than one time in a night. It didn’t feel like normal sp, i could feel the sleep paralysis and i was struggling to move and finally sat up to realize I’m not in reality I’m in a dream. Even when i forced myself to sit up i wasn’t fully out of it i still couldn’t move and then i was back down on my bed still frozen trying to move and call out to my fiancé to wake up but i couldn’t move even my fingers. As soon as i forced myself awake and sat up , i would fall back asleep almost immediately because of my sleeping pills. (I take mirtazapine for sleep at night). And immediately I’m back in sleep paralysis exactly like last time. Same scenario. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a episode, has anyone else had this many in one night before?"
147,"Just joined, been struggling with sever anxiety and ""SP"" or which after reading a couple stories below also False awakenings I believe.",Sleepparalysis,5,"So this being my first post I wanted to give some type of introduction to me. I am 21 and have been dealing with bad anxiety and depression since about 2010, this also happens to be the same year I watched my dad die next to me (story for another day). I am not a very good writer so my structure and punctuation will not be the best , but I recently almost ""kms"" so I want to get my stories out in case one day I fall victim to my own head.

My first story so I guess I should start with my first experience as a 13 yo back in late 2011 if I recall correctly. Some preface, I have always believed my house was ""haunted"" or I just call it occupied by lost souls. From strange experiences with my animals to first hand encounters or strange things happening which I will get to those in other subs like r/Paranormal. Anyway, I'm lying in bed asleep and all the sudden like my brain clicked on but I couldn't move nor see anything but I was sure my eyes were open. I heard what sounded like someone pacing back and forth on the concrete floor of my room, almost kinda  had a  slight slow drag to it like a bum leg being dragged. That was then muffled by loud whimpering like he was stand right next to in my face (I was top on the bunk bed). No idea how long it lasted but i eventually just woke up.

In the morning I asked my little brother (10 yo at the time) if he had heard anything last night, I didn't want to scare him so I wanted to be kind vague about it if he had said no because I knew he would ask why. He did not hear it or anything and when he asked why I told him i just heard a branch fall from the palm tree or something. I kept every experience to myself because I was not quite sure what to make of it. Over time they got different sometimes worse sometimes really uneventful. Thank your for taking the time to read my first story. I'm only really going to share my bad experiences considering the boring ones I'm just there kinda paralyzed for a moment then that's it. Have a good one,"
148,Does anyone use a specific method to wake themselves up?,Sleepparalysis,18,"I have experienced SP and lucid dreaming for years. It usually consists of me feeling like i have woken up already, and am trying to leave my bedroom. I can feel the carpet under my feet and the wood of the door handle on my hand as i turn it. Usually, suddenly, a feeling of unsafey suddenly kicks in and i realize i am dreaming, the mood changes.my body goes into panic mode. Recently when this happens, instead of freaking out about how i will get back into my body and waking up in a sweat, ive imput a method, of waking myself up.

In my dream, as soon as i feel unsafe, i go to the bathroom and turn the tap on. I wet my hand. When i do this, i am able to accept i am actually just asleep and it wakes me up.

Does anyone else do anything like this?"
149,Sounds while completely aware after SP,Sleepparalysis,0,"Just had one of those bad episodes where I wasn't even asleep as long as I know. Just a sudden hit on my body and after that I cannot ease my panic attacks. AllI can do is hear everything around me and a ""psst""-like sound is freaking me out while also annoying me. Maybe it's a small bug but I can't tell.

Also, nobody in my house seems to be aware of anything. Not even my dog so maybe I'm panicking in vain."
150,"Having a sleep paralysis inside a dream in wich I'm having SP. After that waking up to ""real"" SP.",Sleepparalysis,9,"It's been like two weeks, but I had that weird dream in which I've experienced a SP, I opened my mouth and tried to talk as usual, same with moving my fingers until I wake up. There was a zombie like shadow stepping trough the door making their way towards me. 

I woke up, finding myself in another SP, keeping my eyes close, feeling a need to cry. Don't remember much more of it except for:

Waking up (for real this time) having a real sleep paralysis, after dreaming of having two SP's inside each other. 

I've never been so scared to ever fall asleep again god damn it and I dont think i'll ever stop thinking about this experience."
151,SP question,Sleepparalysis,0,"So i just had the weirdest case of sleep paralysis. i literally can’t tell if it actually was sleep paralysis, because my arm was over my eyes, but i was still “hallucinating”. 
i went numb, reached for my phone (i thought) and my hand left several tracers, i felt like i started to float from my bed. couldn’t move a single muscle (although trying really, really hard), saw these beautiful yellow and blue butterflies that coated my vision, i couldn’t see anything but. 
they then scattered into a black mist...

then saw a very vivid, scary (not coated in black), wrinkly figure with a huge grin while choking on my tongue and trying to call for my mom/breathe from my mouth at all... and just being unable to. 

but for some reason, it doesn’t feel like it actually just happened. but in the moment it did. 
has anyone else experienced this feeling AFTER sleep paralysis, like a fleeting feeling that it NEVER happened!? or that it was just a vivid dream? but i never wake up from dreams. i feel like i never fell asleep. 

i just couldn’t see my room since my eyes were covered. i thought i was in my closet?! 

anyone?????

tldr: just had sleep paralysis, but can’t tell if it really happened or not because my arm was over my eyes. feels like i’m already forgetting/it never happened."
152,"Had my first sp?Don’t know what it was,can you guys help?",Sleepparalysis,2,"So I was watching video on 3G my WiFi wasn’t working so I got bored and fell asleep,then I was waking up every 2 min(not sp) then I slept again and I woke up I couldn’t open my eyes and then I felt some pain on my heart and I still couldn’t open my eyes and (was sleeping next to brother) all I heard was him panting like penny wise than I woke up/opened my eyes,was this a sp?"
153,Steve Irwin,Sleepparalysis,5,"A couple of weeks ago in SP, Steve Irwin was hanging on a vine that I have close to my bed throwing knives at my cat. I was trying to stop him by throwing pencils at him. It was just my hand jerking from the wrist in very stiff motions but it was the first time one of my body’s parts were able to move in sp. Really weird."
154,Weird vibration feeling during sleep,Sleepparalysis,9,"Hey guys I’m wondering if anyone has ever experienced this. 

So a few weeks ago I was having trouble sleeping. I kept tossing and turning. I believe I finally got to sleep. I had what I think was a dream. I was in the same position I fell asleep in but I felt this intense vibration behind me and almost like someone was behind me. I got freaked out and began to pray. I wanted to scream and just as I was about to I woke up. I was very freaked out and have been sleeping with the tv on since this happened. 

This morning I had the same thing happen again. I was woken up to this vibration all along the back side of my body it got stronger and I started to pray in my sleep then I woke up. In the “ dream “ I was in the same position that I fell asleep in. 

Wondering if this has happened to anyone? In the past few weeks I have been meditating, attempting to do past life regressions and astral projection.  

Thank you"
155,So recently...,Sleepparalysis,4,"I just recently lost someone very close, they were murdered about three weeks ago. Since then I’ve recently been having sleep paralysis. It’s not every night but it has me terrified to sleep. It’s never happened to me before but last night was the worst. I kept getting out of it, then moving probably an inch and getting pulled back in, when I could move I was so unbelievably exhausted and my body was so heavy I could hardly move. I was scared to sleep after this. Any tips on how to stop doing this or is this normal after losing a loved one? I’m just terrified, the only tip someone said was “don’t open your eyes” which I have btw. I have not hallucinated, I’m just trying to scream out to my boyfriend to get me out of this."
156,Anyone?,Sleepparalysis,8,"Hi, has anyone experienced having sleep paralysis and then the person you are sleeping with experienced it too? Because last night it happened to me again and to the person I was sleeping with right after I woke up."
157,Tormented,Sleepparalysis,5,"SP torments me on a day to day basis and it’s driving me completely insane. Almost every night, especially during early mornings from 4-9. It’s always a presence in my room but I can’t ever see them. (I live alone) I feel my hair being played with, I feel hands all over me, I hear silent laughter and I’ll occasionally hear whispering real close to my ear which makes me jump out of bed. Just moments ago I woke up after feeling something blowing in my face. It’s always something new with this demon, I bet it’s going to start singing country roads next."

159,I have adhd am i more prone to getting sp,Sleepparalysis,1,I have done research all i have found is people with adhd are more prone to sleeping disorders and i think i also have insomnia
160,Trying to relax and fall back asleep back fired,Sleepparalysis,3,"I’ve heard when you’re experiencing sleep paralysis you should just relax and fall back asleep, I tried that and it only became worse.  I got that intense tingly feeling going up and down my back and I started hearing this creepy music you’d hear in a music box in a horror movie, this went on for what felt like forever but was probably 30-60 seconds.  I guess it didn’t help that before the paralysis started, I was already having a creepy dream.  I feel like it was because of the extreme amount of stress I’ve been under this past couple of days."
161,Sleep Paralysis with the country road creature,Sleepparalysis,2,"Long story short, I watch many creepypastas and everyone tells me they will get stuck in my head and hit me at the worst moment. I never believed them until last night. So I was in a dream where I saw a tunnel with blue lights and it was empty. I had a fast McLaren 570s in that dream and so I sped down that tunnel until my engine broke down. I decided to walk out of the tunnel and i saw a car speeding at me. It did a U turn before it reached me and yelled: ""WHAT IS THAT?!"". I looked back and saw the country road creature smiling at me. Then I was back in my room and heard my door opening. I saw the long white arms with claws in my room then I saw the face and then it charged at me and somewhat jumpscared me. However it dissapeared and what I did not know is that the dream was over. My heartbeat went up like no other time and I put my head against the wall and started having lot of questions in my head. ""Monsters ain't real, right?"" ""What if I go in my parents room?"" ""Has he ate my family and now I'm the only survivor?"". I was literally freaked out like I never was and then I started to think about cute and funny stuff that would calm me. I looked at the clock and realized the process of calming myself took around one hour. Then I went back to sleep."
162,I dreamt of sleep paralasis,Sleepparalysis,1,"Okay, so in the middle of a dream i was sitting in front of a mirror and NOT looking at it.5 Seconds later IN THE DREAM i start breathing 3 times harder than the guy in outlast (which is really loud) that lasted for around 30 seconds.That happened 2 times more in the SAME dream.Does anyone know wht happened because this isnt a common sleep paralasis or is this even a split paralasis?

Edit:It was a lucid dream and i couldnt move too"
163,Dark shadow on top of me,Sleepparalysis,1,"Last night I had SP for the first time in a while, was pretty intense. I woke up at around 3 and I could see a dark shadow infront of me, it felt like it was sat on my tummy/legs (I sleep on my back). I sat up slighting and gasped for air trying to make a noise for what felt like around 10-20 seconds. It felt like it was sucking the air out of me (dementor from harry potter kinda thing). Then I managed to push myself up and it dissapeared. 

Feels like something out of a horror movie haha. Afterwards I had to tell myself it was just imagination, but I've never experienced that sort of thing before, something being on top of me. 

Anyways... sleep well all :')"
164,Wanting To See Her Face,Sleepparalysis,3,"Now back in the day like7 years ago I had my first sleep paralysis. It was a very intense feeling of unable to move from bed. Of knowing ""someone"" was keeping me still.

Even then I forced myself to rise from the bed, not wake up but atleast get free and during my first SP I saw the long haired girl dressed in white (which seems to be a common one) at the end of the bed as I rose up. Now I was still numb to really move well as she just ran away from the room and I woke up.

Ever since then I've been thinking about her from time to time and I've been wondering who she is.

So tonight I had my first proper sleep paralysis on my new apartment so I had no idea where she would be. Turns out she stands right next to me with her back towards me and looks at the floor with her black hair covering her face.

So tonight again I was able to fight my way through the paralysis, which feels like going through a static field of sorts.

I then with my body still numb grabbed the girl as fast as I could, holding her thightly and tried to brush her hair aside to see her, but my hands were just too numb and suddenly I was back laying on the bed in SP. But I broke through again this time failing to catch her arm and she got away and I woke up.

I am surpringly aware when sleep paralysis happens and always fight my way out of it and I'm drawn towards knowing who she is. I'm not particularly afraid of her or anything anymore, but I do know that during dreams you're not supposed to look at people who purposefully hide their faces nor should I look at mirrors.

But I'm just intriqued by who she is and why she does this to me. I'm not mad at her or angry nor am I hurt. I just kinda want to talk to her since she visits my dreams every now and again.

Should I see her face?"
165,Something from the dark,Sleepparalysis,1,"Hello there!
I have Had a lucid dream before when I was younger but this one I had last night really stuck with me. It was the first time I experienced sleep paralysis.  

So here it goes 🤷🏻‍♀️

The dream started with me entering my bedroom from my living room, I was trying to turn the light on in my closet so I can look for something. My partner was asleep and I could hear him snoring, my closet my darker than normal and the light wasn’t turning on. As I was trying to alert him to hands with very sharp claws come out from the closet and grab my arms. I fall backwards and land on my bed, I don’t see anything and I can’t speak. I’m trying my hardest to say something but worlds are not coming out. I still feel the hands on me and I start thinking to myself “this isn’t real” over and over again. What felt like an eternity, I eventually felt myself being pulled from sleep and the hands released me. 

I’ve never had a lucid dream like that, could any experience dreams care to elaborate what the heck those hands were or help me decipher the dream?"
166,Has anyone here just accepted their SP?,Sleepparalysis,26,"Hi, I’m that one guy who saw his naked father in sleep paralysis. I’m curious if anyone here knows how to identify sleep paralysis right when they wake in it. For me, it’s easy to know and it doesn’t really frighten me anymore. Just the other night, I awoke to a shadowy figure on top of my chest and it was strangling me. My thoughts were “Oh, alright. I’m just in sleep paralysis. Guess I’ll wait this one out.” Can anyone relate?"
167,This morning I had SP about 4:30am,Sleepparalysis,1,One trigger of having SP for me I realised is a broken sleep cycle when I'm not getting enough hours and waking up multiple times a night. I also noticed my last thought before entering SP had to do with DMT. I encountered an entity that felt like my cat next to me even though I let him out my room last night.
168,My sleep paralysis helped me to get out of it.,Sleepparalysis,1,"I just woke up from it, but it was different from the last few times. It startet as a 'normal' dream. I was at a party at my father's house and joking around with one of my friends, carried him arround on my shoulders and such stuff. Then i was like: damn we forgot our pizza, and we went towards the driveway (him still on my shoulders). Suddenly I felt how my feat  got more and more heavy and I thought :fuck I'm drifting in sleep paralysis. Then I  felt how I was halfway in and half awake, I took al the strength I had and threw myself toward my girlfriend, stroking her, shaking her, trying to wake her up. Feeling how something startet to pull on my legs, overwhelmed by panic I tried to shout or scream I opened my mouth but no sound was coming from me. I tried more and more still feeling this pulling grab on my ankles I started to breath as loid as I could. At this moment my girlfriend startet moving, crawling towards me, finally sitting over me trying to wake me  up. Then se leaned over me and pressed her chest on mine. That was the moment I let go...
And woke up in bed. My girlfriend next to me sleeping peacefully like nothing had happened.

It felt so real, everything. I thought she woke me up..
But she didn't..."
169,Sleep Paralysis Podcast,Sleepparalysis,2,"
Hi everyone im glad to be posting to this group to see if anyone wants to share their sleep paralysis experiences on my podcast. If so send me a message on here so we can talk! Would love to know your stories."
170,Turn SP into Lucid dreaming?,Sleepparalysis,4,"Hey guys I'm new here. It's cool to see that there is a whole subreddit about this! I think people saw that SP documentary and now they look at us like a character from a horror movie. So it's nice to see others who go through this as well. 

I've had SP as log as I remember. I can get myself out of it as soon as I fall into it. But then I have to stay up for a couple hours or I go right back into it. 

I consider dreaming a ""hobby"" of mine. I'm really into what my dreams are and what they may mean. I've spent over ten years trying to perfect lucid dreaming but alas I've only done it 3 times. 

My question is, has anyone ever overcome the SP while it was happening and turned it into a lucid dream? Or has anyone noticed any connections between SP and astral projection? I'm a pretty spiritual person and I know the 'figures' come from somewhere inside of me.

After I figured that out I don't see figures anymore. But I float and spin a lot now which is even worse because of how disorienting it can be. 

However I still think we could be the lucky ones if we learn how to control SP and learn from it. My goal is ""Turn darkness into light and become one with that light.""

Anyways, does anyone know what I'm talking about and have any advice?"
171,I finally found a (legit) solution!!,Sleepparalysis,16,"Ever notice how you can always move your eyes during sleep paralysis but can't move anything else? Well, try moving them around super fast and it will pull you right out of that state. You just need to be intentional about it and think of it the same way as you would think about moving your hand. No idea why this is so effective but really it couldn't be easier.

I also find that it makes me feel much less anxious than when I know I have to twitch my finger which can be really disorienting and hard when my whole body doesn't feel connected."
172,is this sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,2,"I'm not sure if this counts as sleep paralysis or not but I've been wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or maybe knows what it is and possible causes of it.

When i was still in school the only way i could get there was if my dad drove me, but he would go to work super early so i'd get there at 7 AM when class started at 9, so it would give me some time to do whatever, i would usually spend the time face planted on a desk trying to make up for lost sleep hours or just sleep a little extra. this is the first time i remember it happening, i'd be completely sleeping but conscious of it, it felt like a weird dream where i couldn't move or force myself to wake up, but i could hear footsteps and muffled  talking, like someone was in the classroom with me, i'd hear someone who i thought was my teacher, my principal or the cleaning guy who wouldn't usually be there at that time, but there was never anyone there. when i finally got up none of the other students have appeared, only an hour had passed and nobody was there. but the most annoying/scary part of it wasn't hearing people, it was knowing i was sleeping but not being able to force myself to wake up, i'd tell myself ""just get up"" and try to burst the ""bubble"" open but nothing.

more recently I've been also dreaming about  forcing my eyes open but everything seems blurry and i feel dizzy and weak, i don't think i ever actually opened my eyes when it happened but it feels real enough.  sometimes i realize what's going on and just sit it out ""ok fine i'll just wake up soon i guess..."" but mostly i keep stressing out and trying to wake up and then shake when i'm finally awake. every time it happens it's the newest scariest moment of my life, until i'm finally up.

is this sleep paralysis? is it something else? can i do something to make this happen less frequently?  i also take really really long to fall asleep. every time i go to bed I usually wait until i'm extra tired before i actually go, if that matters. also considering cutting caffeine and seeing if that makes a difference."
173,I'm scare to sleep,Sleepparalysis,12,I am very afraid to sleep because of the sleep paralysis I have gone through. Is like there's 2 times of sleep paralysis in one night. It happen frequently like 2 times a month. This causes me to feel scare to go to sleep.. is like it going to happen again if I sleep. What do I do.. I am really tired but I'm scare.
174,First One in Years.,Sleepparalysis,5,"I just experienced SP for the first time in 20 years but this time my eyes were open. I watched my bedroom door close while desperately trying to wake my body and wife. My son is the only other one here and he is fast asleep. Advice appreciated! Ideas, anything..."
175,How to stop having sleep paralysis easy,Sleepparalysis,0,"Hi Reddit folks, I created this post to help people tired of having trouble sleeping. I had this problem for 4 years every day when I was young.

**I dont gonna start explainin why this works, the only you need to know is that when u are on a paralysis u are desorientated, i found the fix of this problem when i was 16 years, after living this more than 3 times per night.**

1. **The first thing need is a piece of paper**
2. **Roll up the piece of paper**
3. **Now u need to put the paper on a very nervous body zone, i always use my feet fingers, if u  dont understand u can see this pic** [**https://prnt.sc/twgshe**](https://prnt.sc/twgshe) **u will put the piece of paper there.**
4. **Go to sleep! Enjoy! u will be free after this.**

**Edit:**

I just edit this to write a little part of my story with this.

Im 19 years having sleep paralysis since 12-14 years every night, how u can imagine i saw and feels a lot of stuff on this mind states sometimes more than 3 times per night ¡ **¿the reason?** i was sleeping on my brothers room in complete darkness causing big states of desorientation during the night.

So i started to find a solution and i found this one night for me. **This not suggestion! :**  when u get into paralysis u are on a big state of desorientation, to help ur mind dont get desorientated u can touch a very nervious part of your body to fix the problem of desorientation

&#x200B;

**Second edit:**

This technique is not suposed to be used every night, u can have dream paralysis every day cause the last night u have it and at the night the mind remember the sentation, with my method in one point u will forget that sensation and stop to having it at the night, helping a lot to stop having more paralysis.

176,Religious and supernatural beliefs v. evolution,Sleepparalysis,11,"I'd like to know if demon hallucinations that accompany SP happen to people with absolutely zero religious or supernatural backgrounds?  So, did anyone here grow up as a naturalist, with no belief in the supernatural, in ghosts, in christian concepts of heaven and hell and demons, and still experienced demons in SP growing up? I'm curious how much effect religion has on that.

And if you fit this description, and you did see some weird monster/demons in your SP, as a kid, how did you interpret it?

I'm wondering if its an evolutionary adaptation in a way, if it's a deeply engrained primitive fear, like the fear of snakes, that we all carry from our ancestors."
177,My sleep paralysis demon,Sleepparalysis,6,"So about 2 years ago we went on a schooltrip to the woods and the first 2 nights everything turned out well the 3 night was the scariest thing happend to me so i dont how late it was but i just woke at that time i dint even know demons really existed so when i waked up i couldnt move which i founded very weird then i look to my friend( i was laying sideways) and i saw a bump in the blanket so i knew he was laying there but then to my horror next to him it standed there(i dont know if sleep paralysis demons have genders) so anyway it just stood there and i guess it was about 2m tall, 6.5ft and it didnt came up to me it just stood there so i went back to sleep and never had sleep paralysis   also how do you get sleep paralysis or does it just happen randomly?"
178,"Scary, but positive experience with SP",Sleepparalysis,2,"I have experienced sleep paralysis several times in my life, some times were scarier, other were pretty easy to overcome. Usually my SP behaves with hallucinations, seeing figures and shadows, feeling pressure on my chest, feeling intense panic and anxiety, and full or partial paralysis of the body. 

The first and scariest time I experienced SP was a few years ago, when I woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible feeling of panic, I was unable to move, I heard (better said imagined hearing) my bed creaking, and I felt a super heavy pressure on my chest, it was almost like someone was sitting on it. I also felt like there was someone in the room with me, the air felt heavy, and I was seeing shadows and figures on the wall. I remember I tried to cry and call for help, but I had no voice, I was unable to speak or even move my jaw. I could only move my tongue, but it didn't really help. It was really terrifying, and when I finally recovered my senses after a few minutes I cried and couldn't sleep for the rest of the night. I am the person to always try to find a logical explanation for things, but that experience was something far beyond my understanding, and I wasn't able to figure out what it was. Sure, I was familiar with nightmares and sleepwalking, but that physical powerlessness and the overwhelming panic were something new. 

It was only about a year after that when I learned what SP was, and I finally understood what happened. Since then, I have had more episodes, which weren't so bad as the first one, but still terrifying. Anyway, I was able to recover and overcome the stress it would give me.

Last night, at around 4 in the middle of the night, about an hour after I fell asleep, I suddenly started to feel like my bed was moving, it felt like an earthquake, and I tried to wake up, but couldn't. I was fully awake and conscious, but my eyes were closed and my body paralysed. Usually I sleep on my side or on my stomach, but at that moment I realised I was on my back, which happens very rarely, and from my experience SP happens especially when lying on the back. So I knew it was SP and was totally aware of it. I had my right hand on my forehead and tried to move it, I felt my body tensing up trying to move, but nothing was happening, I suddenly felt powerless and started to panic a bit. I wanted to open my eyes, but was scared I would see stuff, and decided it was best for my tranquility to keep them closed. I tried to also move my left hand, which was on the bed, but it felt numb and barely there. Then I tried to mumble to see if I have my voice, it didn't work, so then I just tried to calm down and breathe deeply. After about a minute, which actually felt like an hour, I was able to move my feet and then my body started to relax and I could finally move again. Then I just turned on my side, calmed my mind and went back to sleep. 

Why I consider it a positive experience is because I was able to control my anxiety, I was able to calm down and relax, until it passed. Usually the panic makes it worse for me and I start to feel like it's the end, but last night I was totally aware that this was going to pass and I would get back to normal soon. I am happy and relieved that I was able to manage it, and really hope for my future SP experiences to be as easy to overcome as this one was."
179,Sleep paralysis without paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,7,"I’m typing this at 5am, all nervous cause wtf. I was completely asleep, all of a sudden woke up to the feeling of someone touching the sole of my foot. For a second I was like, “What is that?” Until I registered it was fingers. As soon as I thought that I pulled my foot away and touched my boyfriend beside me to see that he wasn’t the one doing it. I lay there for a bit, getting my nerves down before I grab my phone to use the flashlight, and there’s nobody there. 

Ok, one: this suddenly woke me up. Why would I be woken by sleep paralysis?
Two: I don’t remember having the “paralysis” at any point of this.
Three: I don’t remember ever having sleep paralysis before. Very vaguely I may remember that I had it once or twice as a kid, can’t really remember.

So I guess I don’t have a certain question but really would like to hear some thoughts on this?"
180,The giant spiders are back,Sleepparalysis,17,I’ve been having these problems since 2014 I wake up and see giant spiders crawling on walls or ceilings or something that’s not really there and I wake up screaming and running pretty embarrassing because it makes people I date think I’m crazy The spiders had stopped for a min and replaced with me being sleep and then losing my breathe and I jump up screaming and running every time last night I woke up and saw a giant brown spider crawling on the wall I didn’t scream and it disappeared out of thin air it’s embarrassing because now my four year old is asking me why am I screaming so loud and it’s nun thing there
181,Unsure if it was SP,Sleepparalysis,3,"Hello, as you can tell I'm kinda frazzled by this at the moment. I've never had sp before but it was so so intense if it was. The reason why I'm unsure is because I cover my eyes with a blanket while I sleep so my eyes are closed but I also don't have the normal 'I just woke up from a bad dream' groggyness. It started like a semi normal dream but I went to pet my cat and he was just frozen in place like he was getting ready to bite me which he never does but my whole body was stuck in this feeling like I was vibrating. I felt my blankets on me, like the sticky heat from them, while I still had this feeling going on through my entire body but I still just couldn't move and I started panicking because I thought I could feel my cat's claws in my arm. I hadn't been asleep for long and since I have lost the vibrating feeling I feel like I'm going to be physically sick. Sorry if this is the wrong place, just trying to find my bearings."
182,Sleep paralysis made me religious (sorta),Sleepparalysis,3,"I still remember my first time like it was yesterday. It happened one night in 6th grade. I was sleeping in my room with the lamp (on as one does when they are 12 and afraid of the dark). I remember waking up thinking that my mother had walked into my room and tried to call for her. Only for no words to come out of my mouth nor could I move to get up. With my eyes half open and heavily lids, the only thing I could see was the light from the lamp across the room and it felt like I was getting sucked into it. Panic immediately set in! I couldn’t move or scream and I didn’t even know if I was breathing. I thought “Oh shit IM GETTING ABDUCTED BY ALIENS!” You know those movies where kids get abducted from their rooms by a glowing hovercraft and the path of static looking light thing that leads to the space ship? My room felt exactly like that and I thought I was leaving earth. In my mind, I immediately willed my eyes shut and started chanting “IM A GOOD PERSON. IM A GOOD PERSON. ILL BE A BETTER PERSON. DON’T TAKE ME NOW.” Some may call this a prayer but if there was a higher divine being I hope they heard my message. And with my two brain cells, I was able to will my body awake. I woke up, grabbed my ipod touch (that was probs my most prized possession back then), and ran straight to my parents room crying. I didn’t tell them what happened, only that it was a nightmare, fearing that I was almost possessed or that aliens would come and get me. I def didn’t want them to think I was a demon child.

Now I’m in college and sp is still a relatively common occurrence. Reading wiki or asking my doc definitely did not help. And everytime sp hits I still chant “ILL BE A BETTER PERSON. IM TOO YOUNG” in my head. Either way science can’t cure sp and i eventually break from it after chanting so I guess it works. In conclusion, i hope y’all w/ sp are being decent human beings and live a long life cuz I swear i get a heart attack everytime this shit happens to me."
183,"URGENT HELP.... Blocked between sleep & awaken, flashing lights black and white like geometric shapes very profound and me in my mind repeating ''hysteria'' with a weird voice",Sleepparalysis,1,"This happened twice and it's freaking me the hell out of me. I think it's been those last two days. Notice that I have huge neuro symptoms with lyme disease, mcas, methylation issues etc... But nothing shows up on non contrasted mri... They didn't tested nervew anyway. Tonight I think I only slept one hour or so but at a point in a ''dream'' I was being chased by a binch of people. I was with other people but everytime we needed to stop making pauses and I was like heck guys we can't stop we can't stop they're gonna get us !!! Then more the time passes more we lose our members. We were first making rounds in a solid car then ended rushing in a marketplace etc. One of them actually ripped my scarf of me I remember looking him at the eyes a long time being angry, but U needed to move asap !! so jumped everywhere took the escalator and ended outside thenI said to them (my companions) to take water bottles with them there wasn't water in it but weird orange thing but I found 4+- glass water bottles took them but then saw the people left the store go search us outisde... So I jumped on the ground like my friends and that when the physical real life manifestation become too. I began to ''be aware in real life I think ?'"" and was blocked physically bit by bit my eyes saw closed very weird very very INTENSE black and white geometric shapes then me in my mind repeating the words ''hysteria hysteria hysteria'' with a very very very distorded voice. Somehow I know I needed, I NEEDED to wake up. If I didn't I think I would (idk if my consious mind of dreams feels that) but would have ended in the hospital being worse I think idk. It just... Deeply felt like my mind and body and the voice saying ''hysteria'' indeed had hysteria or idk what the hell that is ? Just it felt like it was being driving nuts, like it began to be crazy... I'm so afraid to go back ro sleep now but I need because of my symptoms.. Note that my symtpoms did worsen those past two days. Heck still haven't a doctor that wants to help me... Also note that I do a TON of the weirdest dreams every with no meaning at all. Just plain weird."
184,Does sleep paralysis open up a door to the unknown? (Proven ghost story),Sleepparalysis,16,"About 10 years ago I stayed in a beautiful resort in Key West (The Banyan). It was originally built in the mid-1800s and originally served as housing. In the 1980s it was converted into a resort. I thought I would mention this to acknowledge how much history this location holds. 

Anyway, I stayed there when I was 20 in one of their large rooms with my then-boyfriend and his family. His parents and their friends each had bedrooms within this large room, but my boyfriend and I slept on the pullout couch. 

The last night we stayed there we were on the pullout bed watching Seinfeld after everyone had gone to bed. We were in a spooning position with me facing the TV next to the bed, and my boyfriends arm draped around me. I felt him dozing off (he starts twitching a lot) and I felt myself get pretty tired. Suddenly my whole body goes numb. My mind was still awake but my body was asleep. I know this because I could still see the Seinfeld episode and I could still look around the room. And I had been suffering from sleep paralysis for quite a few years already. 

I continue to look around the room and when my gaze returns to the TV I see that there is someone standing between the TV and the bed. Basically a yard away from me. It’s a little girl. Maybe about 8. She’s wearing 1800/early 1900 attire. A little blue dress with white stockings and Mary Jane shoes. Her hair was in curls with a blue ribbon. But her face was what scared me. It was pale; pale lips, pale eyes. And she had a blank expression. She was just looking down at me, staring. I shut my eyes and started hyperventilating. My deep breathing woke my boyfriend who started shaking me. Finally I snapped out of paralysis and she was gone. I dismissed it as a nightmare and went to sleep. 

Here’s where it gets interesting... fast forward 6 years. I got engaged to my then-boyfriend. My best friend planned my bachelorette in Key West. She chose The Banyan resort. When myself and my group of friends arrive, we make our way to our room. I see that we get closer and closer to the room where I had this “nightmare”. Before I knew it, we were in front of the room door. We were staying in that same room. 

I kept quiet and didn’t tell any of the girls what happened in there. I didn’t want to creep them out... that is until the final night we were there. I told them everything I just wrote above. My best friend decided to google the resorts history. Turns out the exact room we were staying in was haunted. And not just haunted by anyone, it was haunted by the ghost of a little girl. 

The call her the “chocolate ghost” because she is notorious for stealing chocolates from housekeeping (the type they leave on top of pillows). 

So this confirmed that I indeed saw a ghost and was not dreaming. But does it also confirm something else? Does it maybe confirm that sleep paralysis opens up a type of door to the other world? Because in all my “episodes” I’m always hearing and seeing things that “are not there”. Makes me wonder...

Anyone else believe this?"
185,Anyone else?,Sleepparalysis,11,Have you ever been bit during sleep paralysis? This shit HURT a slow painful bite. Almost couldn’t handle it.
186,Is it everything alright? Help,Sleepparalysis,3,"I’ve experienced sleep paralysis since i was 14, i’m 17 now. First one with an allucination.
 But over the past 3 years it went worse.
Sleep paralysis have become a daily thing on my routine i go through it literally every day and just when i think i know all the tricks, i experience something new and totally shit my pants.
Over the past years when i try to nap i suffer from it. I discovered the patron and it’s actually taking a nap what causes it, but i just want to take a fucking nap. It happens like three times in a row before i actually fall asleep.
I don’t necessarily feel presence of demons or spirits but i can’t move, or talk, scream, only see whats happening live right there. 
I began to experience trembling, teeth clinching, that feeling when you roll your eyes? Well that same feeling only it’s like they got stuck there. Not gonna lie, feels like being exorcised or having a seizure. Especially the teeth and eyes part.
I try to move but it only causes more anxiousness and tried to don’t fight it but feel like I’m gonna get stuck there forever and kinda loose myself in that limbo. I wake up dizzy and with heart palpitations, wanting to throw up. 
It just really mess my sleep and I’m scared to sleep. 
Yesterday i was having a nap on the couch and my mother and grandma were watching tv in the table in front on me. I knew what was gonna happen and said “if i fell sleep, look at me” i wanted to prove them what it’s wrong but i wished they would pay me attention. I later had 3 paralysis, in front of them.
Maybe all the sensations and movements that i feel i do they don’t happen in real live life and my brain is messing up with me.
I want to know your story and if anybody felt that way, how do you snap out of it, also if anyone were able to see a psychologist or any medical professional that could help. I don’t know what to do nobody takes me seriously.
Hope y’all have a great day, just joined in and feel more comfortable!"
187,I think I just had SP,Sleepparalysis,8,"I’ve never had this happen before and I’m not sure if it actually was. Hoping for some clarification and advice to make it not happen.

I was asleep,  I heard **\*knock, knock, knock \*** from the right side of my bed it woke me. I heard the same knocking coming from the left side of my bed. I told myself it was in my head but i felt uneasy. I got up, used the bathroom and got a glass of water and placed it on my nightstand. 

When I got back into bed I felt scared like **genuine fear**, i tried to ignore it and go to sleep. I started to hear some muttering and whoosh i felt like i was **falling and spinning** and it didn’t stop. I was trying to move but I could only open my eyes and look around me. I felt like something was there and it wanted to hurt me. I wanted to turn on my bedside table lamp so badly, but I couldn’t move and felt like I was spinning out of control. My television turned on and started playing something that was random but I knew it wasn’t really on I just felt that it wasn’t real. 

I finally managed after I don’t know how long to jolt up. I was scared I checked my phone for the time and it was only 3:40AM. I decided it was okay to go back to sleep after making sure nothing was in my room trying to hurt me. As soon as I decided to go back to sleep **I heard the muttering** and felt that **falling feeling happen on the right side of my body** and I forced my self up and I have been up since. 

I’m really glad I didn’t see anything than a weird television program that didn’t exist. Any thoughts on this?"
188,Can my dog tell when I have Sleep Paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,1,"Hi everyone, this is actually my first post to Reddit after being a lurker for about a year so forgive me for formatting or anything else lol.

I have generalized anxiety disorder and with that comes a lot of nightmares and the occasional SP. Usually you get SP waking up or falling asleep, but I get it after being awake already. 

After waking up, I'm able to move and open my eyes normally but then I'll get a weird feeling. It's hard to explain it, but as soon as I start to feel it, I'll start moving around to advoid it. A lot of the time it does work and I'm able to get up for the day or, after a few minutes of winding down, able to fall back to sleep normally. 

If I can't advoid it, I will feel an overwhelming sense of tiredness and fall to SP. When it happens, I usually just hear static. sometimes I'll hear a girl whispering and/ or screaming. I used to think it was this little girl's spirit that's been attached to me messing with me, but I've come to realize that it's most likely my brain pin pointing the sound hallucination and putting a face to the voice (if that makes sense lol).

So, when I have SP, I'm usually laying on my side. After the paralysis kicks in, I'll start to shake/ tremble and I'll curl into a ball. With that, I also feel like I'm on the drop part if a huge rollercoaster, but instead of it being in my stomach it's my entire body. If I'm able to open my eyes, I'll see a bunch if green and orange flashing lights. I think one time I saw a green and orange palm tree on my ceiling.

I've read that the shaking, trembling and curling into a ball is just apart of the hallucination and it's my brain tricking me into the sensation and its not actually happening. If this is true then how come my dog will come and lay on me? She's roughly 50 pounds, so her laying on me helps me wake up faster. 

Can she sense what's happening while shes asleep herself? Before I got her, I got SP almost every night. Now I can go a year with having it just maybe two or three times. I like to think of her as my protector in real life and in dream land lol (shes an American Pitbull Terrier)

I'm currently dog sitting and I was able to bring her with me. The couch is L shaped and I'm sleeping on the lounger,  shes beside me with a cup holder between us instead of the normal way we sleep: our backs pressed together. (Trust me, she's tried. Just no room lol)

I had sleep paralysis this morning and it felt like it lasted forever. The falling sensation and trembling for maybe 7 times in a row (getting it, waking up and then having it happen all over again) before I was actually able to wake up. When I did wake up, she was staring at me. I do remember attempting to call her name but as you know with SP, it probably came out as a weird sound instead. My dog is pretty fearless so she can sleep through fireworks and thunderstorms without a flinch, so I don't think me making a weird grunt would've woke her up.

Could she sense when I'm having sleep paralysis and tries to wake me up?"
189,One method to slip out of sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,2,"Hey folks, I’m new to reddit but not new to sleep paralysis and thought I’d make a post about how I overcame my sleep paralysis (which I had badly for 5 years).

Obviously this won’t work for everyone and to truly overcome sleep paralysis you’ll need to identify the root cause and circumstance for your own experience.

For me, physically, the best thing to do wasn’t to ‘fight’ the paralysis. I think the automatic instinct is to try to sit up or push against the weight against you. I found this to be ineffective. For me, if I rocked side to side enough times, I could wake myself up and slip from the grip. If you can imagine you’re caught in a rip, similar to one in an ocean, the trick isn’t to fight the current but to slip away from it and swim sideways. Similarly, by rocking or trying to move to the side, I was more able to slip from the physical sensation or wake myself up fully. Don’t look ahead, don’t move up or towards, keep your eyes to the side and ease out of it. 

In terms of mental fortitude or emotional capacity - I found when I was scared, shocked, frightened or angry, these things just made the experience worse. Resignation also didn’t help. What seemed to work for me were a few things: if I teased, laughed at, belittle or downplayed the severity of what was happening, it had less of a grip on me. For example, if I saw a creature sitting on my chest, I’d taunt it with thoughts like: is that the best you got? You couldn’t scare a child with that face. Ohh soo spooky, look at me, I’m a scary demon. I’m not scared by you, I’m sorry but you’re simply not that scary, you’re gonna have to try a lot harder. That seemed to do the trick. The more confident I was, the less it occurred or it lessened the duration of the episode. 

Another trick was to look at what was happening in my life. For example, I had a particularly bad burst when I had a bad breakup with a boyfriend and I’d always find it was him on me or in my dreams. I had to muster the courage to talk to him and resolve our issues and once I did, the paralysis stopped. So if you have any outstanding or unresolved issue - it might be worth acknowledging them, and if you’re not in a safe place where you can confront those issues, you’ll need the support of a therapist to talk it out and resolve internally.

That’s about it - if you have any questions, let me know!"
190,probably a demon in love w me,Sleepparalysis,1,"One morning I had just woken up and I was laying in my mom’s bed, (I slept in there alone) and I couldn’t move or anything. I heard someone say my name and it sounded like it was said right in my ear, I ended up turning around bc I was on my stomach or back and nobody was there. That’s the creepiest experience I’ve had with it."
191,No Fear During Paralysis,Sleepparalysis,4,"I’ve experienced SP all my life as far back as I can remember. I’ve experienced it so long I have rarely had a terrifying experience while it happens. There are exceptions but for the most part I’ve just found it interesting. Last night was an exceptional experience. Instead of trying to get out of it, I embraced it. I was able to get out of my bed and walk through my walls. It ended with me flying above my house.
I’ve often had dreams of mediocre flying but last night I truly flew. 
Does anyone else have positive experiences during sleep paralysis? Has anyone else found a way to control their fear and embrace the lucid nature of the dream?"
192,Did we have a joint sleep paralysis dream?,Sleepparalysis,1,"A few years back I had a very scary and confusing sleep paralysis dream that I could never forget.

In my dream I found myself in a big, dark house along with maybe 3 or 4 other people. We all were very confused and asking each other what was happening and where they were at. Now I truly feel like I KNEW these people, but their faces weren't familiar. In my dreams, faces frequently change when I talk to them, but the people in this dream never changed once. I could feel that they were real people and not just another character in my dream. It was as if we were all connected somehow in some way.
In the midst of our confusion, it was like all of our fight or flights were triggered at once. I immediately felt fear and like I had to run. I knew this same feeling was shared with the others bc i remember someone telling me we have to run and hide. I distinctly remember one saying ""She's coming, i can feel her.. she's coming."" Almost all of us seemed to know who ""she"" was (our sleep paralysis demon possibly?). Another person said that we can't leave the grounds of the house, so climbing out of windows or going through the front door wasn't a choice. We all scattered, but i remember one person following behind me to the backyard. Eventually we split and I attempted to climb the fence, but ""she"" got me and threw me down to the ground before I could get a foot over the fence. She was standing over me and holding me by the throat, and when I woke up in a sleep paralysis state, she was still standing over me and choking me.
I remember her words so clearly. ""You can never forget me. And if you try, i will come back and make you remember."" Obviously, I never dared to forget ever since. But how could I?
Im not sure if this was a shared sleep paralysis dream with other people, but I'm putting this out there to see if anyone has had this kind of dream and heard the same things i did. This dream was a few years ago so what the other dreamers might have said could be slightly different, but that's the gist of it."
193,Triple Sleep Paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,14,"Last night I had one of the most terrifying experiences of my life but Im still pretty confused about what actually happened. I clearly remember 3 separate episodes of sleep paralysis that all happened within like 5 hours and I didnt know that this was even possible. I would have a very vivid nightmare for a period of time and then it would slowly fade into a haze and I would become paralyzed and eventually jolt awake for a second, only to fall back asleep a few seconds later and wake up in another nightmare that was a completely different reality each time until I finally woke up for real. Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this?"
194,Does this count as sp?,Sleepparalysis,13,So i think i am possessed because once or twice a month I believe. i have this weird sleep paralysis experience nothing demonic or scary appears but for some reason i can move around but like very slowly and float around my room and i just hear ringing and i just think really hard that i wanna go back to my body and i wake up? Idk if this is sp i just joined this sub reddit so someone pls explain this
195,I have extremely graphic and vivid hallucinations when I’m experiencing SP,Sleepparalysis,1,"So just as the title says, my hallucinations are extremely graphic. I’m not even sure how my mind can conjure up some of the stuff. 

I will note, they have only become graphic after a traumatic event I went through 4 years ago. Yet none of my SP consists of the traumatic event or seems to be related. 

I’ve been told to stay calm during SP, but I don’t recall ever being aware that I’m actually in SP. I become severely paranoid although sometimes I manage to close my eyes which helps. Although a couple times I tried that tactic and when I closed my eyes I found that my eyelids were ‘see through’ so I had no choice but to see these horrible things. 

Some of the things I see (without getting too graphic) are 
-monsters of any sort: gargoyles, horned devil looking things, melted looking monsters. 

-My loved ones being harmed in the most horrific ways. 

-being dismembered slowly. 

-shadow figures

All the while not being able to move or scream. 

I can also be dreaming and something will trigger me in my dream to panic severely enough to where I lose control of my body and wake up in SP. I always hear a scream in my dream, not mine, when my SP starts in this way. It’s a woman screaming. 

I get SP maybe, on average, 3 times a month. I eat healthy, sleep regularly, drink lots of water, etc. 

Any advice on how to not have SP as much or change the graphic nature of it?"
196,The Irony,Sleepparalysis,0,I got the next 3 days off. Been up since 3a.m. and its currently 524pm my time. Im staying home and watching Freddy Kruger movies and relaxing. Im super tired. Have been drinking hahaha. And i have Sleep paralysis. DREAMS ARE MADE OF THESE!
197,Befriending my Sleep paralysis demons,Sleepparalysis,45,Hear me out imma try and just say whatsup with them and chill with them ask em questions and stuff this might work they only hurt when u think they can which increases the chance of that happening wish me luck also any tips on this?
198,It’s been years since I’ve had SP until 2 nights ago...,Sleepparalysis,0,"I think I just need to get this dream/SP off my chest..

I was having a hard time sleeping in the first place, last time I had noticed the time on my phone was about 2:10 AM
I fell asleep sometime after that and had a recurring nightmare. 
Very simple, I was in my new apartment with a girl I went to middle school with, it was very dark in the house and we were on the middle floor. We could hear the sound of someone coming into the downstairs and she went to go check it out, I tried to follow her and would freeze and literally couldn’t move. 
This is where the dream would stop and start over again. 
I never noted what we were doing, it just always started with us being in my dark apartment, the sound of someone intruding the house and her going to make sure everything was okay and me freezing with fear unable to find out what was downstairs.
It felt like it had cycled through this so many times until it got to the point in one cycle she had gone downstairs to see who was in the apartment and I was frozen with fear unable to move like all the other times and then I heard something up on the third floor(loft style) still unable to move I shifted my eyes up the stairs to see a shadowed figure coming down the stairs. 
There was an intruder upstairs coming for me, now alone as the girl I was with in my dream was downstairs. I felt so much panic I tried moving, yelling and screaming. It got closer and closer to me, I don’t know if it was my partner waking me up because I was actually screaming in real life or if I had woken myself up by screaming. 

I was apparently talking in my sleep, repeating my partners name over and over again as if I was asking him to wake me up. 

It had felt like I had been sleeping for most of the night and when I looked it was only 3:19 so at max an hour of sleep. 
It was just such a strange and different experience to when I use to have SP, it’s been at least 6 years since I’ve had SP. I had never been in a dream it was always like I had already woken up in my bed and would feel fear that there was something behind a door and would panic but not be able to move, speak, I could hardly turn my head as if someone was forcing me to stare at the door I feared what was behind. 

It was just such a strange experience and I had such a hard time shaking it off. It hasn’t happened again and I have no idea what sparked it. Because I use to experience SP so frequently I know it’s nothing to be scared of but boy is it hard to remember that when you’re in it."
199,How to experience so,Sleepparalysis,5,Ok so I really want to experience so bad because I’ve NEVER had an experience. I get lucky if I even have a nightmare more than once a year and most people would thunk that’s lucky but I feel drawn to the paranormal but I never experience it. People say it’s scary and I really want to see how it feels but I’ve tried to experience it. I watched videos on how to make it happen and nothing ever works. I am really bored and nothing weird or scary had EVER happens to me and I really want to experience sleep paralysis. So if you know how to experience sleep paralysis PLEASE let me know how and how to control it because I don’t want a damn ugly creature trying to scare me with it’s uglyness. Also I feel I’m pretty good and not getting scared because of ugly ass looking things or scary looking things only jump scares make me jump but it doesn’t scare me so PLEASE leave your tips for me.
200,Has anyone had sleep paralysis within a dream?,Sleepparalysis,19,"Has anyone had sleep paralysis within a dream? I experienced it first In my bed and focused on powering through to become lucid and I went into a dream state but instead of becoming lucid the symptoms followed me into my dream and I could hear all the usuall sounds and the force’s that act on my body when experiencing SP, however I was in a completely different house dream of my ex and her mum. It was quite the somthing."
201,Another episode this morning. Felt a hand gently rubbing my shoulder from behind.,Sleepparalysis,0,"My episodes usually don't involve traditional paralysis, just the hallucinations as I'm coming out of sleep. 8/10 times I can move on command, or at least after building myself up to doing so with a deep breath. And once I do move I fully wake up, and the feelings stop.

As mentioned in another post, I rarely see anything, because I'm usually waking up at 11 am when my room is already fairly lit. It's harder for the mind to manipulate shadows and lack of sight the brighter your bedroom is. Bulk of my hallucinations are touch. And because I sleep on my side, it's always from my blindspot, behind me."
202,"All I heard was ""Eeeevil... eeevil... eevil.""",Sleepparalysis,1,"I was sleeping on the couch at my brother's house and his roommate got home at like 8 am after being out all night. I had an eye mask on so didn't look but I woke up to the sound of him opening the front door into the living room where I was sleeping. I then heard a voice as clear as day say ""Eeeevil... eeevil... eevil..."" what sounded like right outside the front door or by the front window--but NOT in a creepy way. It was as if someone was joking around and doing a really obviously bad job of being creepy. I assumed it was a friend of the roommate who had come home with him and went back to sleep. I laughingly asked him who it was later and he had no idea what I was talking about. He insisted that he had come home alone after staying at his friend's place and had neither heard nor made any noise. I asked all of the other roommates and some of them had heard him come home but no one else heard the voice. I asked him again to make sure he wasn't just messing with me and he swears he doesn't know what I'm talking about. We don't really have the kind of relationship where he'd be messing with me like that either. After discussing it with my brother, the only plausible idea we could come up with was that it may have been auditory sleep paralysis/hallucinations since I was awoken out of a deep sleep before it happened. The thing is, I didn't experience any feelings of being paralyzed per se, though I didn't partucularly try to move either. I also wasn't scared which seems to be common with most experiences (I think?). Lastly, I've never had sleep paralysis before this. 

What do you think the voice was?"
203,I’m really scared,Sleepparalysis,5,"I have never had SP once in my life but for the last two weeks it happens at least thrice a week. I’m up right now at 3am because it just happened and I’m too afraid to sleep now. Anyone has similar experiences with mine? About a month ago, I realised I started having looped nightmares, it plays over and over again. Then it got worse and my looped nightmares started having different layers - for instance, layer one’s nightmare looped by itself, when it completes, layer two’s start and layer two’s is worse than the first, the more layers I get (thus far, max I had was 5), the closer to waking up I became/realising I am in a dream; I can’t wake up in real life until I have woken up from each layer, it is as suckish as it sounds :(. And now, for the last two weeks, SP has been added to the layer looped nightmares and I’m not sure why things got so bad. I’m afraid of sleeping now, it’s wildly uncomfortable knowing I’m awake but can’t move and when I do try, it feels like pins and needles everywhere. I manage to break out of it by trying to squeeze my tongue between my teeth and biting down as hard as I can. :( any comment will be appreciated!!"
204,Realistic demonic dream??,Sleepparalysis,1,"Okay so I’m not sure it was sleep paralysis cause it felt so real or that’s the whole point?? last night I fell asleep around 9:30ish pm. I kept waking up throughout the night but I was in and out of sleep. I remember waking up around 2-3am at first I woke up thinking I was smelling something burning. It smelled like if wood and plastic was burning. I brushed off after sniffing the air for a couple minutes and I no longer could smell that scent. I fell back to sleep Then I heard my window opening and someone or thing crept through my room.. and whatever it was had something plastic with it. So I could hear the plastic moving with the steps. I was have a mini panic attack, I didn’t want to open my eyes or move, my heart was racing. The whole time I was thinking I’ll give it a couple minutes and I’ll turn over and grab my phone and double press the power button so the police can be called. I kept trying to listen where the thing could’ve gone in my house or if it tried to hurt any of my family members. And before you know I fell back to sleep. This morning I woke up.. obviously but I saw nothing missing my house. Later on today I will ask my parents if they heard anything last night.. this really bothers me it felt so real but I’ll be dumbfounded if it was all just a dream. My sister thinks since I’m trying to get close to God it’s a demonic thing that is trying to stop me.. I do believe in the paranormal but I had other dreams that something is trying to tell me things."
205,Today I died.,Sleepparalysis,1,"Im not sure how to start this since Im in this sub for the first time in my life and also only had SP only a couple of times. But this one was different and thats why Im here, writing it down and still trying to comprehend what did even happen to me. Yesterday I got drunk with a couple of friends I havent seen for a year, had some pretty good time. I woke up at around 4am which is a classic as far as my hangover goes, grabbed some (a lot of) water, had a pretty quick breakfast - scrambled eggs with a baguette and blue cheese. I was watching youtube for maybe half an hour and went straight to bed, trying to fall asleep because I was craving for some more rest. So I fell asleep, had som pretty nice dreams actually, I remember I was jump diving in a very nice, sunny location. That was precisely before I was put in what Im almost convinced was the worst pain I have ever felt, both physicall and mentally. It started pretty normally, as soon as I “opened” my eyes I immediately realized that I was having SP. Now keep in mind that I dont know a whole lot about SP so Im not even sure which of these body/mind activities were happening in my sleep or in actual reality. I also concider myself to be a strong person as far as psychic goes even though Im not sure if this is the right way to put it and hope it doesnt sound egoistic either. Basically I started with what I thought was the best approach to stop the SP as soon as possible. I started trying to move my hands but every material I thought I touched felt exactly the same so I knew I wasnt actually moving. Then I slowly started to move my fingers, both on hands and the legs but I was convinced it wasnt doing anything. My next and final step I could think of was just to stay calm and try to fall asleep again, then wake up. Time was passing extremely slow and I wasnt falling asleep so I decided to play with it. Since I know SP often if not always contains some kind of hallucination/s and my dream didnt have any (well, except that I was awake) I decided to create my own. At first I “woke up” in my room, same as with the previous SPs except this time I knew right away that something was off. Previously it was basically indistinguishable from my real room, this time it felt.. assumed. The layout of my room was the same and the furniture stayed but it wasnt so vivid. Also a blindingly aggressive source of white light was burtsing through my windows. Now here comes the part where my imagination started working. I subconsciously changed that awful light to a beautiful meadow scenery, I could hear that kind of nice, natural sounds like when you are taking a walking through the forest. I felt the warmth of summer sun on my skin and felt almost euphoric. Then, for the sake of being me I decided that it was a time for experiment. I remember me thinking that if I could make it this nice, if I could also turn it well.. bad. And I did. I started very cautiously changing the scene to the darker one, I thought if I could imagine some kind of silhoutte standing in door like from a horror movie. In case you havent guessed it, this is where it went downhill. When I saw the silhouette I instantly thought “Ok, I can do this but the meadow was a lot nicer, now make it dissapear”. Closed my eyes, was ready to be on that beautiful meadow again but that wasnt really what happened. The scenery was now what I concidered to be a very twisted, dark mix of both “worlds” Ive imagined. I knew I had to wake up at that point because it was only getting worse but then I felt something I have never felt before. I completely lost control and it felt almost like my own concious attacked me for testing it. The silhouette was still in the door, windows were swapping between the meadow scenery and that blinding light, all the colors of my room went very cold and started fading away and I started to feel extreme pain mixed with adrenaline in all parts of my body. That I thought I could handle but what I certainly couldnt handle was what comes now. I had a literal talk with my concious, convincing me that this is how schizophrenic people percieve reality (mental illnes is probably my only real fear so you can probably only imagine how I felt) and was asking me if I like it that way and if we should keep it like that. I couldnt react to it in any way. When I thought that this just cant be any worse I started choking. Now I knew this was all the SP (still didnt make it a single bit less bearable) but the choking was my main concern at this point. It felt so real that even though I knew that the worst thing to do when you are having SP is to start fighting it like trying to move around and aggresively wake up but when you think you are going to die you are not really thinking about that. I wanted to yell so much that I cant even describe it, I knew I couldnt so I started smashing my hands around me histerically, hoping that my neighbours would hear something and will try to save me. I was trying to create as much noise as I could but I knew I wasnt doing any. I swear to god that I could feel leaving my mind and my body. I was convinced that there was nothing more to do so.. I just let go. I relaxed my body even though I was choking, exactly like when you are drowning and your lungs fill with water. I was staring at my ceiling with no breath left and I was so reconciled with me dying that I think I even welcomed it at some point. At the end all I saw was.. nothing. Pure darkness with no sound and feel and only thing I could think about was a girl that I broke up with half year ago. This is the part that I think I wont be able to explain properly. This feeling it was.. the most peaceful thing Ive ever experienced. My body was left in my room and I felt like I became a part of that darkness that was surrounding me. Nothing and everything at once. There was nothing, not even me or my feelings and the only thing that stayed was my conscious. I saw the girl I mentioned before with a beautiful big smile, extremely vividly, just floating around the darkness I essentially became and the last thing that happened with me was this sheer warmth and eternal peace I felt when I was confident that I was on the edge of death knowing that I had nothing to worry about, anymore. I only asked  myself: “Is this it, is this how it ends?”. (which I only now as Im writing it realized that this were the last words I used when we were breaking up with the girl)

After saying this, I instantly woke up. I immediately realized that nothing of what I have experienced has really happened and the reality has hit me like a ton of bricks. My eyes were full of tears, I started gasping for the air even tho I knew I could breathe all the time just fine because if I couldnt I probably wouldnt be writing down all of this now. I was in complete shock for good couple of minutes which was again something Ive never experienced before.

So to sum it up.. I seriously hope I didnt offend anyone suffering with mental illness with me comparing my experience in SP with schizophrenia. I also hope that it didnt have some kind of romantic or spiritual turn to the end of it. I also realize that this was all just in my head, drinking previously also may have helped to make the SP even worse. And lastly I would like to thank you for reading through all this ."
206,Is this sp?,Sleepparalysis,2,Hello guys.. this is my first ever post so I’m not sure how to approach this?? Anyways.. My brother had a nightmare and I’m not sure if it’s sleep paralysis or not. He said he felt like he couldn’t move and he was calling out to my mom and dad but he wasn’t able to speak or be heard. He also said that it happened twice in 1 night and on the 2nd time he heard someone say “stop struggling” and felt like he was being pushed down. He said he woke up because he broke its fingers and it let go of him? Any information helps😞
207,SP feels like it’s bleeding into my reality because I’ve been having it so often,Sleepparalysis,0,"I’m in a place in my life where i’m very stressed by certain mental conditions and that’s probably making my SP worse, but lately i’ve been having SP dreams that are so intense and vivid and they’re happening so often (almost every other night at this point) that I don’t have time to recover from the last one. It feels like I’m seeing the same things in my waking hours and get the same painful/repulsive tingly feeling in my skin as when my SP demon gets close to me. I get enough sleep (slept 8 hours last night and had two SP dreams back to back), but i’m just worried when I wake up from it and it still affects me throughout my day."
208,"never had sp, but i might’ve just had it from a dream?",Sleepparalysis,1,"just had the most intense dream nap thing that  might’ve been sleep paralysis? it was a series of small naps where every now and then I’d become aware and kinda wake up but  then things started to get weird in the dream (like short bits of life were happening but only for like 2m then it’d clip to another and i got overwhelmed) so i wanted to get up. usually if i am like “oh this is weird like a dream i want out” then that wakes me up but this time it felt like i was stuck in the dream world and  i was trying to move my physical body but all the muscles were really tights and each muscle or tendon felt like felt like trying to stretch a balloon if that makes sense? and i rolled off the bed and tried so hard to get up but my body/brain wasn’t letting me and there was someone in the room with me and they were like “you can’t get out” but i kept trying and pushing and giving all my strength to stand up from the weird squat position i was in. eventually i stood up , but then i realized that that didn’t even happen. like all the movement didn’t actually happen, i had been in the dream the whole time. that whole ending part was like in black and white and it felt like I had some sort of clouded vision, like when you stand up and blood rushes to your head? and i got a bunch of those blood rush sensations throughout the thing. but anyways when i woke up  my whole body was sore and tired, especially my back, and i was kind of out of breath and i didn’t know what was real and what wasn’t, and i sat up and was super confused with what happened and how easy it was to move again. it may have been just a weird dream but it felt like something more. the entire waking up part of it felt like some one or thing was trying to get me. maybe a message?  and before the big nap i had a series of small attempted naps and time went really slow between those. like i had music playing and was ready to doze off but i would kinda doze off and wake and see that only 6 minutes had passed, and i thought it was like an hour. that happened at least 3 times before the weird stuff. i am thoroughly confused and kinda shaken by this all"
209,Who did I meet? Where was I?,Sleepparalysis,4,"Hi all! So I’ve been trying to astral project for a little while now. After a night of mediating for several hours I decided I would go to sleep. I ended up getting sleep paralysis, which I get fairly often. But This time it was different. Normally I’m in my room and often time I see things that are scary. This time I saw a woman she was very very beautiful, and I was standing in a courtyard with lots of stone structures. She said something to me but I can’t remember what. We began floating upward and spinning around each other, it felt amazing, the best feeling I’ve ever had. And then out of nowhere I realized it was sleep paralysis and everything went black. Then it felt like I sat up out of my body and then snapped back down. Then there was a weird image of white swirls imprinted in my vision until I was able to move again. I’ve been shook all day. I want to meet this woman again. Anyone know what happened?"
210,Sleep Paralysis; consequences of sex.,Sleepparalysis,62,"Female, late twenties. Spent 3 days on a birthday bender, playing party monster amongst a group of 10. I made it my focus to keep everyone happy and going like a bunch of spinning tops. I’ve always been able to infect others with my energy but I only let myself do this when I’m drunk. It’s also easiest then to let my guard down. But it’s also against my better judgement because it feels like I’m intruding on that persons will. As a teenager I used to ask myself if it was a form of rape when I did it in bed with men or women. Im only adding this to the story because I wonder if it’s relevant. 

What happened: On the final night i had wanted to walk home 5 minutes but my friends insisted on dropping me off in their taxi. I had felt pretty clear headed. Drunk, warm, happy but contemplative and i really wanted to just enjoy the stars and walk a block through the park. I felt like i just wanted my body and energy to myself rather than being crammed into the back seat of a loud taxi. And to enjoy myself. There are moments after partying, late at night where everything goes silent and it feels like you’re in your own music video. The sky is sparkly and you can watch everyone around you living in their own little worlds. 

Either way, i took their taxi. Walked into my apartment, fell into my bed and i was out cold. 

I woke up at 3-4 from a dream where i saw myself in my bed and someone was on top of me having some sort of sex with me. I wasn’t pinned down, i could “move” but it was heavy. I could feel the weight of it on me. It was like sex but it wasn’t clearly touching me and there was no penetration. But more like wandering hands over me and inside of me. I started enjoying myself, i even made it a point to welcome the sensations and “have sex back”. It felt like everything was melting together. Like when you have sex with someone you care about and start melding together. As soon as i started to orgasm i realised something was really wrong. Like i shouldn’t be giving this person my orgasm? Or that part of me? 

SUDDENLY it was off of me. Standing by my bedside. It was dark like a shadow. Endless blackness. But human like or manlike? With spindly arms. Long hair. Some sort of drawings or symbols all over its body. Concave bone chest. It wasn’t huge or towering. It wouldn’t let me lift up from the bed and was holding me down without physically touching me. I could see myself naked in bed and it right near the top of my head watching me. Almost as if it was amused and calm. I didn’t feel like it wanted to hurt me but it didn’t want to let me go even though i was praying and demanding it would. But i couldn't speak. Just lash out with my thoughts.

I woke up and fell back into fitful sleep and went back to paralysis two more times. This happens often. Back to back paralysis. It just felt like whatever was going on wouldn’t let me be. 

Eventually i got up and got water, and turned all my bedroom lights back on and fell asleep. 


My questions are: Is this a common visitor from my description. What are the consequences of me having “sex” with it or orgasming. Are there other things that can be done with those entities or are they purely there for feed and leave?"
211,A super real life dream(but not lucid)before entering to stage of SP.,Sleepparalysis,0,"I have frequent SP until the previous year which SP just stopped happening , but recently SP was back and the same goes to for the nap in the afternoon today.I know and I am aware of it when SP is about to happen,the feels,the sounds,everything right before SP ,I am familiar with it.So SP happened, and this time I just ignore it and continued to sleep. I dreamt about a badass character doing some crazy badass sh*t and I'm super excited ,just like watching a movie, and then I just realized I was reacting to it in my dream , as well as in real life , by grinning while watching the scene.The sleep paralysis is still there, but right after dreaming abiut that scene,I felt like some sort of energy just swooped in my ear and SP is gone and I woke up.

I wanna experience SP again as I wanna try lucid dream,so I just continued to sleep right after SP happened(which is more likely to have SP when you sleep right after SP happened).But , SP never happens after that.But , I was only right before the stage of SP and maybe I'm too aware of it when its about to happen, and that's why it didn't. but I feel tingling in my head and vibrations as well ,while dreaming.This time I dreamt about my crush , which is hiding from me recently.I've already accepted the fact in real life and was not too depressed about it, but in that dream which is right before the SP stage , it felt so real and it hurts lIke 3x more.My emotions were SO REAL. I woke up being down and sad , and of course I continued to sleep again to make SP happen.And, this time, I fell into a sea, randomly.I was at the same stage as before as well , tingling in my head and vibrations surronding me.I can feel like the sea water going into my ears and my body sinking slowly into the sea.My ears felt so uncomfortable as I thought the water was in my ears and I woke up, once again , and checked my ears.I'm so amazed before the SP stage happened I can dive so much into the dream.I think the last one which is falling into the sea , just if I'm aware of I'm dreaming , I was able to lucid at that moment."
212,What Happened?!? I have not idea how to categorize this!,Sleepparalysis,4,"So this is from about 10 years ago (about 8 years before I could Astral Project) and while I was living in a house with weird paranormal shit which I won't include in this post.  To this day I still can't figure it out.  I woke up into a sleep paralysis situation (laying on my back) for the first time ever because I couldn't breathe and I could not see clearly without my glasses but there appeared to be a horned demon-looking thing on my chest choking me with one hand.  I could feel the across the front of my neck and I could look around with my eyes but I was pinned down and nothing came out when I tried to scream.  I starting praying and struggling to move and with all of my effort I was able to raise my left hand up and get a strong grip (my weaker hand though) and grab a wrist of the hand that was choking me.  I clamped on to the wrist and starting pulling the hand off me neck.  Once I started to get some air, I regained some strength and I was able to pull the hand about 6 inches away from my neck when I realized WTF! My left hand had a death grip on my right hand which was still open and doing a single hand choke across the front of my neck!  I don't remember if the demon started fading before or after I realized I was being chocked by my own hand but this doesn't make any sense to me...

* If this was sleep paralysis, then how could my right arm do this?
* If this was alien hand syndrome, then why has my hand never exhibited behavior like this before or after being in that house?  The only other times that I know of anything similar happening to me was what my wife told me after I told her this story the next day.  She told me that my right hand had tried to choke her a couple times in the prior week.  I was laying my stomach then and luckily my right hand couldn't get any leverage at full extension from the side and she said that she was able to wiggle free.  She said she just assumed that I was dreaming and was considering sleeping in a different room if it continued, but didn't mention it until I told her what happened to me.

We did some things to cleanse the house and eventually moved out, but I can't remember the timing of those things with respect to when I tried to choke myself out, but it never happened again after that.

Any theories?"
213,Can sleep paralysis happen in a dream?,Sleepparalysis,3,"So i had a dream where i was trying to sleep like in real life just but it wasnt working, i think to myself, “ill just go get some marshmallows from the kitchen. For some reason i think my lights are clap activated so i try clapping but i cant move, i decide to look up and i see someone looking down on me. It honestly scared me to death because the person looked too tall to be a family member. I think the shock is what woke me up because the next thing i remember is looking up while lying on my bed. My heartbeat was high so i though “oh it was just a bad dream” but when i look to my left to lay on my side to go back to sleep, its there, the same person looking at me. It didnt move but now i couldn’t move and i thought i was gonna die because i was awake and not dreaming. I , not wanting to keep looking at it closed my eyes thinking if i cant see it, it cant see me. Around 2 minutes passed and i opened my eyes and it was gone."
214,Don't really know what to make of todays morning,Sleepparalysis,3,"To set the stage: I (m20) slept in my gfs bed, while she was at university studying. I fell back asleep after she left at around 9 in the morning. I then dreamt a somewhat normal dream and suddenly found myself lying in her bed alone. Barely being able to move, i tried opening my eyes a little more but they wouldnt open all the way, so i was struggling already. After about 30 seconds of fighting to get my eyes open, someone entered the room. I could just hear a male voice but the figure itself was invisible. He started talking to me about something philosophical and a theory of his, which i sadly forgot about through the day. But he got really angry after i said that i like to believe in facts rather than ideas but i wasnt unfriendly or anything. I told him i understood him and liked his idea but i couldnt blindely accept it. ""The voice"" got so angry that he punched me in the face, or at least it felt like it. No pain, but a shock through my body. At that point i fought with everything i had to open my eyes and push him away but i was barely moving. The most i got out of myself was pulling the pillow from under my head over my face. Then i suddenly woke up amd could open my eyes fully.

Now i really dont know anything about sleep paralysis, neither if this was anything close to it. But it effected me through the day. I'ld just like to hear some opinions. So if you read it, thank you kind stranger. Have a good one :)

TLDR : an invisible dude spoke to me about something philosophical while i wasnt able to move. He then punched me and i woke up."
215,what the fuck happend this morning,Sleepparalysis,12,"i dont know a lot about sleep paralysis, but i know the basics and I think I might have experienced it this morning.

I was almost awake and ready to wake up, until I suddendly felt paralyzed in my whole body. I felt a figure behind me put its teeth down to my neck and started biting me. It was really uncomfortable and scary but it didnt hurt at all. I never got to see the figure but I could hear it making noices. 

After like 30-45 secs of this going on, I finally woke up finding myself punching the side of my head before I sat up and realized that it wasnt real. 

Really scary experience, I'm so scared that this will happend agian."
216,Bursted blood vessel in eye,Sleepparalysis,2,Last night I had a pretty intense SP episode and I was struggling harder than usual to get out of it because I fell asleep on the couch and could hear my family around me so I was try very hard to get their attention. Later that night I got up to go to the bathroom and when I looked in the mirror I noticed a bursted blood vessel (red dot the size of a sesame seed) in my left eye white. This is very strange to me as this hardly ever happens. In fact I can’t remember any time that it has and I’m 43 years old. Has this happened to anyone else?
217,NSFW: my sleep paralysis rapes me,Sleepparalysis,48,"No clue where I'm supposed to talk about this but I just woke up to sleep paralysis again and after what felt like an hour of desperation, finally broke out of it. I never see anything when I get sleep paralysis reccently, I cant open my eyes during it but I do litterally feel myself being raped and someone's nails digging into my arms and really painful sex and it's one of the most awful things I've ever experienced and im just so so desperate for a solution, this is a desperate cry for help."
218,Is it possible to control your sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,5,"I’ve been having sleep paralysis off and on since I could remember. I’ve always had intensely vidid and lifelike dreams since I was a kid. I smoke weed and still have dreams that feel so real. Many of them used to be watching people die, but it was always their skull crushing, like those old liveleak videos of decapitations and cruel things😣 it’s started to get better in that aspect but I’ve been getting more sleep paralysis lately. This morning I got it bad.  i could see everything even though my eyes were shut but in a weird reality. I calmed myself down and first tried lifting up my fingers but nothing. At this point I was just having fun with it. I tried so hard to open my eyes, it felt like a piece of my brain was getting pulled out or something weird. I stopped trying to open my eyes because it hurt pretty bad but I started trying to yell for someone to come in and I guess try and wake me up, but all I could hear was myself barely making a mumbling noise. lastly I tried my body again, it was buzzard, I started to feel my muscles spasming and my hands started twitching uncontrollably, or so it felt. I’ve never had a seizure(I pray to god it stays that way) but I’m assuming that is what it may feel like. Anyone relate? Has anyone been able to control it?"
219,I don't know what to do,Sleepparalysis,3,"I first posted something similar in r/sleep cause i didn't know this sub existed. I searched this sub and i couldn't find a similar question, but if there is i apologize. 
Ive had sleep paralysis for a long time and i dont get scared anymore. I barely even get visual hallucinations anymore so now it's more of annoyance than a scary experience. 
However, the thing i usually use to snap out of it (moving my thumb and then all the other fingers and moving up my arm) doesn't work anymore. 
someone said i should try to close my eyes but that just starts a lucid dream and i end up sleeping. 
I have a decent sleep schedule but i end up closing my eyes a lot during online classes and almost immediately when my eyes are closed i have an experience. 
Is there any way to wake up immediately? 
Ive even tried to watch the class through the paralysis but its really hard."
220,Being attacked by a sucubus during SP?,Sleepparalysis,5,"I generally dont feel physical experinces during my SPs but last sunday un the afternoon I took a nap with my GF suddenly felt paralyzed and feeling that something squezzed my both nipples (not in a pleasant way 😕) and after that the same with my buttocks I was having a painful time when fortunately my GF woke me up. 
I Felt a presence there I closed my eyes by previous experiences.
Has anyone experienced something like that?"
221,Question regarding third eye,Sleepparalysis,2,0
222,I think I experienced my first SP this morning...,Sleepparalysis,6,"I was fast asleep this morning when I felt two hands holding on to mine firmly. For a second, I assumed it was my mum, but I begun to realise that it wasn't. I was trying to open my eyes but couldn't; it felt heavy to literally open my eyes. I then begun to shout for my mum, and even begun to shout for my father (who I do not talk to, and haven't for the last couple of years...that's how terrible this situation felt). However, this was only processing in my head as my mouth was not moving, though I could hear me shouting for help. This, what I believe to be a SP, lasted around 10-20 seconds. I woke up at 4:27 am and didn't even look at my left side (where I felt this happening) for like the next hour. This was no dream, I literally felt a firm grip in my hands. It felt like whatever was holding my hands was crawled, and I ""sensed"" a black figure."
223,I was able to control an SP episode for the first time,Sleepparalysis,1,"A few nights ago, I fell asleep on my back which often triggers an episode for me. At some point in the night, I opened my eyes to see a woman on top of me. Her head was far enough away that I could make out her features; looked to be about mid 30s, had dark brown hair that was twisted back into a late 1800s style, soft eyes, and overall pleasant features. Now that I'm recalling her appearance, she kind of looked like an older version of me from a different era. She looked like she had something urgent to tell me, but idk what it was or could be. I knew immediately what was happening, and I just couldn't be bothered dealing with an episode, so I willed this woman to morph into my bf. I just looked at her and thought ""you're just bf messing with me"". All of a sudden, she took on the form of my bf and became relaxed, putting his head down on my chest and snuggling me as he normally would. As soon as I registered it was now him, I went back to sleep. This was definitely the chillest and least scary episode I've ever had, and first time I was able to control it in any way. Though now I really wanna know what she had to tell me."
224,Was this sp?,Sleepparalysis,6,"I had one terrifying experience, but I'm not 100% sure if this was sp or just a nightmare.

It happened 3 years ago. At the time, my daughter was still a baby and would often cry at night and wake me and my wife up.

We went to sleep at our usual time, there was nothing particularly interesting happening that day and there was no sign that something weird would happen.

I remember waking up in the middle of the night and first thing that caught my attention was the light. To be more precise, the absence od light. We used to sleep with our bedroom door open and light on in the bathroom, so it would give us just enough light in the room to manage, since we were getting up often to take care of the baby. 

But now it was very dark, I could barely see shapes around me. I was lying on my back, while my wife was sleeping on my right. I felt she was moving, so I asked her if she was awake. 

Me: are you awake?
Wife: yes 
M: what time is it?
W: I don't know
M: why is the light off?
W: I don't know
M: did <our daughter's name> wake up?
W: who?

At this point I got very confused, something wasn't right with the way she was replying. I tried to look at her, but I couldn't move my head at all. I started hearing this big commotion from her side, like something very big and heavy was moving and loud, heavy breathing, like a bear was breathing down my neck. Suddenly I was really scared. I was desparately trying to move or stand up but I couldn't. I was sure that this thing next to me wasn't my wife, but something pretending to be her. I remember thinking it wasn't someone, it was SOMETHING. 

Somehow I managed to move my left arm and I remembered there was a night stand on my left, with a lamp on it. So I reached out, grabbed the cord and started searching for the button to turn it on. I found it and started pressing, but all I could hear was clicking and there was no light. 

At that moment, noise to my right became unbearable. I felt strong pressure on my chest, like someone put a boulder on it. I couldn't breathe at all, I was sure I was dying. I saw a hand (it looked more like a claw) with long nails reaching out and grabbing my right arm. I could feel it's nails ripping my skin and it felt like I just blacked out for a moment. 

Next thing I know I was sitting in bed and screaming. Wife was holding my right hand, at the exact same place where I felt the claw. 

Somehow she managed to calm me down and she told me that I started crying really loud in sleep and it woke her up. She grabbed my arm to see what's wrong and I just jumped and started screaming. 

I never experienced anything like that again and I sure hope I won't."
225,Experienced sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,3,So last night was my first time with sleep paralysis. I didn’t see anything but I heard this loud ringing in my ear and felt the force on my hands. Nothing too bad but tonight my mom had it. I woke up to her yelling ‘Help me’ but it was so quiet I almost didn’t hear it. I ran to wake her up and she said a dark figure tried to crawl into bed with her and was just staring at her. I was just wondering if this was hallucinations or maybe we have a demon in the house that’s getting us both? It freaks me out.
226,Kissed by a Being,Sleepparalysis,2,"How many people have been kissed on the lips by something while in sleep paralysis?
My friend just told me their story of SP and they were kissed. I had the same thing. During an afternoon nap I had an SP event during which my mom’s friend from my childhood Paula walked into my room. Paula was never a threat or anything but a nice aunt figure in my life. Her daughter and I were friends growing up. Either way during this SP Paula came into my room, slowly walked around the bed to the side I was laying on. This whole time I was trying to scream, but couldn’t muster anything due to the SP. Paula sits down on the side of the bed right next to me, leans in and then gently kisses my lips. I’m still trying to scream and wriggle myself out of the kiss, and after a few moments of terror I was able to snap myself out of it. 

Is having an apparition kiss you during SP common?"
227,Any particularly funny/stupid experiences with SP?,Sleepparalysis,8,"This one's pretty tame, but during my last SP episode, I was going through all the usual methods I had to try breaking out of it - move my fingers, flutter my eyelids, ignore the creeping shadows threatening to overtake me, etc. I managed to wrench my jaw open and had a brief moment of triumph, before my body settled right back into sleep paralysis, this time with my mouth frozen wide open. I spent the next five minutes or so trying to close my jaw and thinking about how stupid I probably looked, before falling back asleep. 

I also had a different experience in which I had an SP demon (which I normally don't get) looming over me. Instead of having a head, it had my phone sitting on top of its neck with the screen showing someone I disliked calling me, and I hallucinated my hand reaching out to the demon's head to accept the call. That was fun. 

What are some of your sillier experiences with SP?"
228,First SP episode,Sleepparalysis,0,"Hi everybody, I am seventeen years old and experienced sleep paralysis today. I woke up about  5am and started running errands by 7am. While I was running errands I decided to go to the library and pick up a book- the book i picked is Emily’s Brontë Wuthering Heights which was originally published in 1847- I read the first chapter and started to doze off once I arrived home. My senses and awareness were still intact and I started to daydream. I was dreaming I was at a movie theater- when i suddenly felt someone smothering me irl. I thought someone was sexually assaulting me- I was being spooned/ choked. I couldn’t defend myself and was unable to speak/ move for around 2-3 minutes. << It felt a lot longer. I started to feel intense fear. Once I was able too, I shot up and realized nobody was there. I went to my mom and started to grasp what just happened. My mom immediately prayed for me when I was able to discuss what happened to me. She thinks it was a demon- I called my friends and they believe the old book is haunted. I am not really a superstitious person and don’t want to believe it was any of that but I can’t deny the fact I felt a presence."
229,Is it just me?,Sleepparalysis,3,"I have been getting SP for as long as I can remember, at the beginning it was very panicky and usually accompanied with a scary dream. But for the past couple of years (I get them every couple months I guess) I'm very aware of whats going on, and my dream is very life like - I'll dream that I am in my bed, and trying very hard to get up or scream for my partner to help me get out of it, sometimes I do manage to get up in my dream, but then it ends and it starts back to the beginning, still stuck in bed. Its so life like that I have to ask my partner in the morning, did I manage to get up and talk to you last night? I've even had ones where it feels incredibly real when I've tried to text my partner, and I was certain I managed too until I checked my phone in the morning. These episodes lasts for 30minutes it feels. More irritating than anything now."
230,Recovering from an episode,Sleepparalysis,2,My SP episodes often in the middle of the night. Does anyone have any methods they they use to successfully get back to sleep after an episode?
231,An actual good sp experience,Sleepparalysis,0,"I've been dealing with sleep paralysis for maybe a year or 2 now and my experiences are always violent. I always hear weird things and my body feels like its moving at the speed of sound in a direction that changes every 2 seconds. Earlier tonight, I had that type of miserable sleep paralysis. I got to sleep once more, and I have this weird culmonation of dreams and borderline nighmares and wake up once more. At this point its around 5am. I give myself a good 15 seconds to realize everything was a dream and attempt to sleep onces more. When i closed my eyes i saw this faint light and my first thought was to chase it, dont ignore it. Im not in any dreamscape yet so I only raced towards it mentally. The light got bigger and brighter as if it exploded in front of me and i chose to embrace it rather than take cover. Boom, im paralyzed.  My body felt at rest and everything was in slow motion. I tried to move around and I think i saw my own figure do so but it looked more like the silohette of my own soul rather than my body. I couldnt escape my body so it felt like a failed attempt at astral projection (something i srill have never done) because i opened my eyes too early but it still felt amazing."
232,Experiencing Hell through sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,"So this all started when I was 14. I was very into demonology so I read a prayer to summon Satan. Later that night I woke up and was completely paralyzed. I started praying and as soon as I finished the prayer with “amen” i was able to move again. The most disturbing part was that right after finishing the prayer I heard a sinister laugh in my right ear.  Fast forward 5 years and I experience a 2nd sleep paralysis. Before this happened I was begging GOD to show me that hell does exist and that I was ready for it.  2 weeks pass by and it happened! 

   I was in my room getting ready for bed. Woke up around 3:30 am and I was paralyzed. I tried fighting but couldn’t. Out of nowhere half of my room turned pitch black and out of the darkness I saw a shadow of a demon with horns. It came towards me and wrapped his arms around my neck and dragged me straight down into a dark place. As I was being dragged down I felt immense depression and had no hope of ever getting out.I told myself “This is it! Nobody will ever find me here”. This place was pitch black but for some reason I was still able to see the demon. I freaked out and said “Jesus help” and was instantly let go. As I came out of the darkness I heard a women yelling “HELP ME”. That alone made me believe hell was real.   This experience happened so fast but felt like eternity. 

Ever since that experience I’ve had dreams of demons being cast out of me. Everything is fine now but I don’t recommend asking or wishing anything unless you are ready for it."
233,SP LD or nightmare?,Sleepparalysis,1,"I woke up around 2:30 a.m. soaked in my own sweat and scared as hell. I had a dream that all I could see and hear was white noise and I couldn't move properly,  talk or swallow. I got up from my bed scrambling around trying to get help from my parents but I couldn't hear them or really see them due to the white noise. I felt a lot of electricity going through my body and it felt like I was dying. The dream happened twice because I remember ""waking up"" to the same experience. When I finally woke up for real I was shaking and cold, and it felt like I had experience something like death or an abduction (the world felt surreal and sad). Has anyone ever experienced anything similar, especially the white noise and feeling death aspect?"
234,What is the earliest memory you have of sleep paralysis and/or a sleep intruder?,Sleepparalysis,0,"I don’t usually talk about my SP in detail because I feel like focusing on recent experiences make them get worse but I am curious about my earliest memories of SP. I swear I have had it my whole life. My earliest memory of it was when I was around 4 or 5 years old (I know this because of where I was living at the time) and it the way it was would be like a nightly routine into my nightmares. I would fall asleep and there would be a figure standing over me speaking to me and basically instructing me. He would then push me into the nightmare and at this point I was lucid so in the beginning my Initial response was to rebel and get myself out of the nightmare, but then I would find myself back in my room with the figure shaming me and my behavior (sometimes even shaming me for behavior from real life). Eventually I grew out of that and experienced different forms of SP but I’ve never forgotten that first terror."
235,What happens if someone tries to move you while going through sp?,Sleepparalysis,4,"Title says it all really.

For a long time now I’ve tried to communicate to my girlfriend when I’m going through sp through trying to change my breathing pattern if I can. So far I’ve been unsuccessful in getting her attention. The idea is she would just try and move me and get me snap out of it.

I don’t know if it would work but I figured it was worth trying. I wanted to know if anyone else has tried the same and if it works? I was also wondering if it would hurt?"
236,Anyone else thought sleep paralysis isn't that terrifying?,Sleepparalysis,31,"I'm now 18 and when I was 16 and 17 years old I had frequent sleep paralysis happening , like it could be 4 to 5 times a week sometimes. The first time of course it is terrifying for me , can't move any parts of your body, the more you resist the more your fear grows.But after a few months experiencing sleep paralysis , I've figured out how to get out of it in a fast way , is by keep moving your toes(which you can move) as well as your eyebrows sometimes.And using this method I can get out of it in maximum 5 seconds.

So another special sleep paralysis experience happened later , when I was sleeping at night I had SP again.But this time everything felt much more heavier , it is a lot harder to move anything , and this time I opened my eye a little bit. I saw a black figure or dust on my left side.It felt cold and chills on my arms and shoulders. I can hear it mumbling beside my ears( can't listen to what it says).
I felt terrified back then , but when I woke up I feel like its not that horrible , as I'm interested in sp myself that time. So after that experience any other SP is not terrifying anymore for me. And even today I had SP in a nap after a very long interval for not experiencing it , I even feel myself grinned when SP happenned.

Am I crazy or I feel excited because its been a long time until today I experience SP. As I know SP can become luCID dream when done properly(which I failed everytime).Maybe that's why I am excited and I feel like dreams in SP is something so special and different compared to ordinary dreaming."
237,Demon played with my body,Sleepparalysis,5,"Hello guys, I had some SP cases in the past but i was only paralysed for few seconds and then was everything ok. Few weeks later i had my first case with the “demon”. I was paralysed and I realized that I have SP again.. Then i moved my eyes to the corner of my room and saw a black humanoid creature. That creature Immediately dissolved into a black fog cloud and flew over me to my back. Then that fucker grabed my body and started pulling me over my mat. He was doing that aprox. For 10 second and then i woke up at same place i fall asleep. It doesn’t help my insomnia. And I need to know if somebody had similiar experience like me.."
238,Repeat Experience,Sleepparalysis,5,"I wanted to preface by saying I have only experienced sleep paralysis once before in high school. I was facing the wall next to my bed with my back to the room. I woke up and was immediately confused, wondering if I was still dreaming. I couldn’t move, but I could open and close my eyes. 

I felt something tug on my braid. I felt it once and assumed it was just my imagination. But then something whispered in my ear. And laughed. It rugged on my braid again, harder. 

I tried to scream, to move but nothing happened. The third time it yanked on my hair I managed to scream for my mom. Who ran in and ‘woke me’. 

Last night I woke up in the same bed. Even though it’s been over six years since I was in my old room. Again I couldn’t move and the experience repeated itself. I couldn’t move and that thing was laughing and whispering words I couldn’t make out. 

At some point I screamed for my mom and started fighting to move because I scared the bejesus out of my boyfriend who woke me up. 

I’m really creeped out because I never wear my hair in a braid anymore when I sleep because of that experience in high school. And last night was the first night I had put it in a braid in a long time."
239,Had my first sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,2,"Hey guys,

One week ago I had a car accident which caused a concussion. Last night I went to bed around 8:30 because I felt tired and dizzy. I have used some benzo’s to sleep the last couple of days but I threw them away cause I didn’t want to have withdrawals, that on the side. 

It felt like I haven’t slept since I went to bed and apparently I had and have really realistic dreams where I’m texting people, drinking some water etc. and after waking up I realize I have slept and it was a dream. 

So around 23:00 I woke up or I was still awake, not sure.  I felt a very heavy feeling on my chest, had a weird buzzing sound in my ears, couldn’t move or talk. It felt like someone was coming for me, I could actually hear it coming closer. As I said I couldn’t talk or move, I tried to say “stop” or something like that. It was horrifying and I was scared to sleep after that, I have slept around two hours, and again with the realistic dreams so I don’t feel like I have slept. 
This experience has really scared me and I’m scared to sleep from now on when I’m alone. I can 100% say this was the scariest moment of my life. Anyone who has any tips for getting over this? That makes it sound quite dramatic but it really scared me. Thanks in advance!"
240,"Last night it happened, and it felt...beautiful?",Sleepparalysis,2,"I was laying in bed about to fall asleep when I just opened my right eye, I tried closing it to go to sleep but I couldn't it felt like it wasn't quite responding, I probably opened my left eye while focusing on closing the right one, and so never picked up on the fact that it closed if it did, I guess.
After that I try to get under a blanket, that's when I noticed, my body weighed a ton, I simply couldn't move, I started thinking to myself: huh interesting, so is this sleep paralysis?
Then I started asking myself: dang if this is sleep paralysis then where is the demon? I want the interesting stuff to be in it too! I thought to myself that I may aswell experience it all, at that point my brain picked up on the queue or something and went started working; darkness.
Darkness started to engulf my room, like complete pitch black darkness, and then 3 orbs of light that sort of left behind them a trail that would fades into the dark popped up, they started spinning, they eventually became more like multiple small orbs, my 'demon' started forming, a bunch of spheres spinning around formed infront me the shape of a human.
Multiple small orbs revolving each on a different plane to make the shape of a human, that being of light looked mesmerising, then I started thinking to myself: didn't people say the demon chocked them? And so after thinking it put it's 'hands' around my neck, I couldn't feel them, my breathing wasn't in anyway constricted.
After that I guess my eyes managed to close or something? Or maybe everything returned to pitch-black darkness? I reckon it's the prior because my back started spasming, maybe it was more than just my back but I'm uncertain.
I tried to open my eyes while back was spasming but couldn't, and then after it was done I was able to control my body normally.
 I actually felt more parts of my brain working than usual, idk why I feel my brain like physically working sometimes and being physically foggy some other times, but that's another issue I guess.
My back felt better after the spasms then it usually does, it was like a natural massage I guess? Lmao.
It didn't really feel scary, it felt...rather interesting and weird, maybe beautiful is a way to describe it, it left me curious about what happened and wether or not I was asleep."
241,Spiritual view of SP,Sleepparalysis,1,I had sleep paralysis a couple of years ago but tonight i heard a story from another person and I’m wondering if i should see it as something to do with my religion. Should i have seen the shadow as a demon or a spirit. Idk but it never came back idk if it’s a good thing or a bad thing but it did scare the shit out of me in the moment.
242,F sleep paralysis!!!!,Sleepparalysis,0,Geeze!!!! I was in a dream and all of a sudden I sort of became aware. My ex was talking kind of badly about me..it was something I got defensive about..anyways..his eyes turned black and i was like oh ok let’s face this demon head on then! So I saw his eyes and sort of went into them..and i could hear this “euuhhh” growly screaming voice..I was like whatever I need to expel this demon shit and fully confront it..then I “woke up” and the screaming was outside of me. Like ewww like right behind me..just this AWFUL noise...omgggggg What the actual...ugh f***
243,My experiences,Sleepparalysis,0,"Hello everyone! I just discovered this sub and wanted to share my experiences in the past with sleep paralysis. All of these are years old and I haven't had another in quite some time.

1st: My back was facing the ""witch"" and she was using a hold spell of sorts to keep me in place and drain my energy. She had long grungy hair, wore a white mask with black V lines down it, and was giggling as I fought tooth and nail to turn around even though oddly enough I could see her from behind me. This struggle goes on what feels like forever when my alarm clock finally goes off, I see waving rainbow clip art text that reads ""Goodbye"" and then my cat bolted down the stairs. Shook me up for a few days and felt way too real for comfort.

2nd: I was dreaming that I was a soldier on a hillside over watching a snowy field with a red barn. I saw a figure come out from behind the barn. I look through my scope but the figure is no where in sight. As I pull away and look with my naked eyes however, the figure was MUCH closer. Again I look through the scope and again, nothing. Each and everytime I do this, the figure moves closer and closer until it is 20ish feet away. I could see it was the same masked witch, my fingers were frozen on the trigger, and then suddenly I am ""awake"" in my bed, unable to move, and the masked witch is just staring at me from across the room. I try to scream, curse, and fight with no luck and she just...watches. Eventually I am awoken by my gf at the time who said my breathing and grumbles concerned her enough to check on me. 

3rd: I was at a friend's house spending the night. All was normal until I role over and see a brown hooded cloak, mid rotting figure that instantly puts me in the breath gasping freeze that we all know too well. It slowly extends an arm, revealing a flesh rotting hand, points a half bone finger  at me and says, ""I will consume you."" I try everything I can to scream and curse with no luck. Eventually it gets up, leaves the room by walking through the door, and I am suddenly able to breath again. I laugh, ""Ha yeah that's right run away you lil B..ch!"". I  get out of bed and open the door only to see the hooded figure directly in front of me. I am frozen again, forced back onto the bed, and it continues to point and repeat over and over, ""I will consume you."" Eventually I am awoken by my phone and shortly afterwards make a quick goodbye from my buddy's place.

4th: I ""wake"" up, unable to move or breathe. I begin to see a shadowy mass of fog to my right begin to solidify. This one however I am able to self break away from, it vanishes, and after a few shaky hours, I fall back sleep soundly with nothing else.

5th: Again I am ""awoken"" in the typical SP state. I look around but see nothing. I then hear my stairs creek as a very fat plague dr. makes its way up into my room, turns the corner, and just stares at me. I try to yell, ""Go away!"" along with a series of slurs and insults. It eventually slowly turns away and walks back down the stairs and I am able to finally sleep peacefully once more.

Those are all of experiences with sleep paralysis. I have no idea why they all hide their face and I seem to always enter fight mode when it happens. Also I think I should add that all of these events happened during very stressing times in my life. I have never had a single event ever terrify me the way SP has and as odd as it sounds, I low key miss that feeling. Now nothing seems to really scare me and I miss that primal fear. Thank you for taking the time to read my tales and I look forward to reading everyone else's on this sub."
244,It felt like a spirit was channeling through me,Sleepparalysis,3,"So, I recently joined reddit and discovered this page. I’ve shared this story with a lot of people but none that have experienced SP before, so I’m looking forward to any responses to this. 

———

About the time I was 15, I had come home from school around 2:30 like most days. My mornings started at 5am, so naturally I was very tired upon my homecoming. I would take a quick nap most days before starting homework. One day, I routinely went to take my pre-homework nap only to be “woken” a few minutes into closing my eyes. This is where it gets terrifying for me. 

So, I was laying on my back cus I just fell back on my bed and shut my eyes. I remember opening my eyes and seeing these flashes of very bright light in various colors... light purple, light blue, pink, yellow.... I tried to move but I couldn’t. Then, I sat up at like a 45 degree angle (if 90 degrees is sitting normally)... I was stuck like this. I tried to talk but couldn’t. I felt like my soul was stuck in my body but I had lost control. It was a bizarre feeling. Then my mouth started to move “on its own” and I began to try to say words that came out sounding like gurgles. I felt like my body had been taken over because I kept saying “help me” ... it felt as though I had a male spirit in me trying to talk to me or someone. Idk. After what seemed like forever I was “released” and I fully woke up... I jumped up and ran to my mom and just sobbed because it was so terrifying for me. It still fucks me up to this day and it’s been over a decade."
245,Paralysis too lucid dreaming,Sleepparalysis,5,"Can someone tell me how to get from paralysis into a lucid dream, I was told it’s possible, but I find it very difficult to do. It would be really helpful as I literally have sleep paralysis almost everyday lol."
246,just a question fellow sp'ers,Sleepparalysis,1,"hi everyone,

my first experience with this was about 10 years ago.
ive had multiple episodes a night for weeks straight.
the last year ive had no cases whatsoever.
it stopped ever since i smoke a joint before i go to bed.
and i was wandering if more of yall had weed as a solution
im here in no way to adress that this is a solution but just wondering.

thanks"
247,my first sleep paralysis experience,Sleepparalysis,0,"i think i've experienced sleep paralysis before.. but not the sleep paralysis where you see shadows, hear noises or feel like you're being touched. i just couldn't move, but i didn't feel fear and after it had gone away i just went on with my day. anyways, today i experienced something i would never wish on anyone, not even my worst enemy. 

when i decided to call it a night i put on binaural beats to help me wind down, and when i did fall asleep.. people might say that, that could've been the cause.. but, i've been listening to the same sounds made by the same person for months and this has never happened before. who knows though.

i had a dream where i felt my tooth was about to fall, but i was 100% aware i was in a dream, i even said *'oh well this probably means something.'* after that, i had a false awakening but i felt scared for some reason.. i went to look for my sister but i had just ended going in circles around a random neighborhood. people kept staring at me and trying to talk to me in that dream.

after that, i actually woke up but i couldn't move. i tried really hard to, i looked around my sister's room (i'm over at her house for a while.) and everything looked normal, no shadows, nothing scary. i motivated myself and told myself not to give up and to keep trying. i tried really hard but still couldn't move. that's when i tried to reach for the closet door handle. i might've been imagining this because i felt as if i did grab onto the door handle. anyways, from there i tried to pull myself up so i could go find my sister. but, every time i tried it felt as if there was some sort of force or energy stopping me from doing so. i tried this for a couple more seconds before falling onto bed. i was out of breath from trying to get up so i just laid there but then i started to feel uneasy, and dread.

i was terrified at this point and it was just an overwhelming energy that really scared me. i think my intuition was telling me that i had to leave because i had a feeling something was about to happen and that's when i heard something. it was a ringing sound but like a siren or one of those trumpet sounds. i tried calling out for help. in my mind i could hear myself clearly but when i actually tried to scream out to my sister, not even a whisper came out. i kept trying to call for help but after a while of trying i had started to give up, i laid there closing my eyes scared out of my mind. after a while i finally had the ability to move and to breathe.

my legs felt very tingly and it was difficult for me to stand but when i finally did i was just so scared. i had no idea what had happened. and i was trying to think of an explanation of what that was. i bursted into tears when i found my sister and i told her everything.

i have a strong feeling that when i was trying to reach out for the door handle that it was some sort of astral projection. but all i know now is that i experienced sleep paralysis. i just really hope this was the first and final time that that ever happens."
248,Just had another episode of sleep paralysis. Please let me know how I can stop this from happening again.,Sleepparalysis,29,I fear it’s getting worse and I want it to stop.
249,Just had another episode of sleep paralysis. Please let me know how I can stop this from happening again.,Sleepparalysis,7,I fear it’s getting worse and I want it to stop.
250,Did i have sleep paralysis or was it just a nightmare??,Sleepparalysis,12,"So yestarday when i fell asleep it was all normal and i had  a dream, in my dream i was in another country in the house where my grandparents live. It was day time and i was going to bed and when i fell asleep i woke up and could not move and i couldn't even say anything but i could hear my voice and screams in my head and then i see a woman with very white skin, black short hair and green lizard eyes and she had a big smile on her face and her teeth were sharp kinda like shark teeth, sha had big claws stretching down to her feet. She was floating towards me and a song started to play and i realised it was the Halloween theme. I started to panic when she came closer to the point where she was standing beside my stomach, i couldnt move but i heard my screams in my head. She lifted my leg up and skratched them from my ankle down to my knee leaving a really deep wound and there was blood everywhere. She did the same thing to my other leg until i woke up to my mom shaking my shoulder and thats when i also woke up from this nightmare or whatever it was. Im just wondering if this was real sleep paralysis or just a nightmare where i had sleep paralysis. Yes i have expirineced sleep paralysis before but there were no creepy stuff just me not being able to move while i was awake and panicking."
251,*trigger warning*,Sleepparalysis,9,"I’ve gotten sleep paralysis for years now, normally i know how to calm myself down and get out of it. I’ve seen demons, dark figures, etc. But this last time I got it, there was a man figure on top of me trying to rape/ sexual assault me. I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else, I googled and didn’t find anything. just don’t want to be alone it was scarring."
252,Talked with the “Devil”,Sleepparalysis,25,"To start off, I’m aware this was my hallucinations brought forth by my intentions. Just thought it was a cool story to share.

This morning I had sleep paralysis. I decided to experiment. I had the intention to hear the most demonic voice possible and see if I could scare myself. 

First it began with this blood curdling scream/ yell that was both deep and high pitch at the same time. It was so loud it sounded as if speakers where blowing out. It also had this slight digitized tone to it that sounded like it was glitching or distorting.

Since this was my intention I remained calm. I then tried to go into a lucid dream. As I did this I suddenly heard a voice start talking to me. It was extremely deep and low, very demonic and animalistic sounding. It said “I’ve fallen, Evan. I’ve fallen.”  (my name)

Reminding me of the story of Lucifer falling from heaven."
253,First In a while,Sleepparalysis,2,"I have not had sp In a good while. Last night,
I was having a pretty pleasant dream and I’m not exactly sure how it switched from that to a horror film. What I can remember is all of a sudden I’m “awake” in my room. I’m on my bed and a dark figure walks right toward me and I’m terrified. I try to open my mouth to call out my bfs name(he was right next to me) and I couldn’t. I try to move I couldn’t. My anxiety was through the roof and I just had the feeling that this thing was going to harm me. It seemed evil. I almost forgot how terrifying these experiences are. Does anyone know if stress relates to sp? That’s all I could think of that could have triggered it."
254,"Mysterious creature touching me when i go to sleep, and sometimes when i wake up",Sleepparalysis,14,"I dont know if my experience can be categorized as sleep paralysis, but it is definitely something like it. I hope that maybe someone has tried something similar, or know something about it.

For quite some time now, I’ve been experiencing these weird confrontations with some hands touching me when I go to sleep or when I’m about to wake up. But it is especially bad when I’m trying to take a nap during the day.

In the start it was just mysterious hands touching me, but it is getting worse. I’m experiencing it everyday lately, and I’m seriously afraid to go to bed.  A month ago it happend once or twice a week, and it was “just hands”. But now I feel like it’s a full creature, like a spirit or something hovering above me.

Sometimes I feel like it is mad, and sometimes it’s not. I’m completely conscious when it is present, and I can even open up my eyes, and I’m able to move. If I wait too long with waking up myself though, sometimes it will push me down in the bed, giving me trouble to breathe. And sometimes it will breath me in the head, and I can literally smell the breath. That is obviously super terrifying, also considering the fact that I’m only 14 years old and I still easily get afraid of that kinda stuff.

But sometimes i don’t feel like it’s mad or dangerous, and I will just let it be there for some time while I’m too tired to get completely out of bed. But it is also at that point it feels the most real, and not nightmareish. It is invisible though when I open my eyes while it’s present.

Excuse my not so good English, it’s not my first language."
255,Can you dream about having sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,3,"I know the title sounds stupid so let me provide context. I went to sleep at around 9pm and woke up at 2am and this whole week I've been sleeping with my light on ( just forget to turn it off) so I was always have to get up and turn it off. So that happens and I'm not really tired so I scroll around on netflix and find a show to watch, So I watch that for a hour or so and just naturally turn my head to the other side of the bed and see a women lying there staring at me, So then I immediately look up from my side and lay on back when I start to hear noises at the back of my head. Then I see a black creature slowing start covering my door so this is when I try move my hand to cover my blanket over my head to not see whatever that creature was and I couldn't move it and I thought to my self is this sleep paralysis? Somehow I manage to close my eyes (This is where i'm not sure if it even was SP) but when I was close my eyes I just see like faces pop in and out of blackness nothing in particular to remember just random faces. Once the last face disappears I either am awake for a bit then sleep or fall staright back into sleep, The sleep after was nothing scary but a fairly long dream and I remember waking up in between the dream and remembering this whole ""SP"" experience but shrugged it off and continued the same dream in my other sleep which is odd for me as it's never happened before where I can sort of recontinue a dream. I know sleep paralysis can be different for different people but I didn't experience a feeling of not breathing, I could close my eyes for a brief second, and I thought to myself mid SP that this was an ""SP"".  That's why I think maybe I dreamt this and it was a nightmare and you think it's that just call me out for it I'm not trying seek validation for a SP experience . Um I think that's all it's a bit long so if you read it all, thanks. Sorry for my bad english cbf to read over again aha. But yeah would like to hear people's thoughts about this one."
256,Positive affirmations after SP experience ?,Sleepparalysis,4,"Can anyone pass on any helpful affirmations , chants , or sayings to calm the spirit after an SP experience ?"
257,Does lucid dreaming cause sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,3,"Almost every time I've lucid dreamed or at least tried to lucid dream I've woken up unable to move (sleep paralysis) directly after it ended, also lots of the stories I have read have said how it was after a lucid dream so, do lucid dreams cause SP?"
258,Just had my first sleep paralysis!,Sleepparalysis,3,"Aight so to get things started, my room has a window which leads to the deck. I was lying in bed on my phone at like 11:50pm and was super tired so as you'd do if you felt tired, I went to sleep. At the time of having the sleep paralysis I was just lying down on my bed facing the window and couldnt/didn't move (don't know if I even tried). A couple seconds go past once waking up (by waking up i mean entering the dream, it felt like waking up) and i hear two to three people talking on the deck. Immediately, I was shook because the only way onto the deck is either going past my room and opening the door or climbing up the vine thingo. So I'm in bed thinking we're gonna get robbed. A few more seconds go by and the two people stop talking but I can still see their shadow through the window. Suddenly I feel someone's hand pulling at the back of my neck and I wake up in a sweat. 

This was a crazy experience because everything looked and felt SUPER real. The hand at the end grabbing me also felt incredibly real. If you have, thanks for reading :)"
259,I think that r/Sleepparalysis should allow pictures:,Sleepparalysis,16,I was wanting to share all of my sleep paralysis demons that I Drew. But I can’t post them. Commit rather you agree or not
260,Weird story read if you want to,Sleepparalysis,0,"So I was already well rested but I woke up around 12AM so I tried to go back to sleep around 3AM and I woke up in my dream and I was there with my grandma and someone unknown people. Fast forward I was sleep on a couch or something (eyes open, still in dream) and I tried moving, and I couldn’t. I started rubbing my legs together and moving my toes. The weird thing is I could see my body in my dream. I was able to move after a few seconds then I woke up in real life unable to move. I moved my toes again and I was able to move for like about 3 seconds and then I was literally frozen again. After that I moved my toes and sat up so that I didn’t get frozen again because I was getting kinda scared."
261,"Is it normal to get ""sleep paralysis"" before you even go to sleep?",Sleepparalysis,7,"There have been a few times where I'm ready to take a nap and I feel this creepy tingling feeling making its way up from my feet and I realize that my body is slowly going numb. I start hearing a faint white noise and it's hard to move, but when I manage it, I snap out of that paralytic state.  This is rare, but it happens to me very now and then. Has this happened to anybody else?"
262,Couldn’t wake up from my dteam,Sleepparalysis,1,"I was dreaming and for some reason I guess I noticed that and that made want to wake up but I couldn’t really wake up from my dream and I got the feeling thar the people in my dream were trying to let me stay in the dream. I also was sort of being electrocuted and I could feel some of that, not for real because it was a dream, but I did feel something. I also woke up once and couldn’t have my eyes open but then I got soaked back into the dream.

But I’m awake now, not sure if I want to sleep right away or if I’m going to stay up for a while..."
263,Unsure,Sleepparalysis,8,"Sleep paralysis: People talk about demons invoking fear in their victims. Much like a creature such as freddy Kruger entering dreams except it isn't as vivid. You can't seem to make much out of anything. 

My experience is from roughly two years ago, I was dreaming and believed I had woken up, only I hadn't. 
I was experiencing sleep paralysis. There was something above and behind my head. I sleep with the top of my head to the wall and so this shadow figure was leering over me through the wall just above my eyebrows. I couldnt see much as I couldnt move. My bed was in the centre of my room at the time and the door was slightly open. I always sleep with my bedroom door shut. It was open and the light in the corridor was on. I thought this was strange in hindsight ofcourse but at the time I was completely in shock. I was screaming for my dad and trying my hardest to move. The best I probably managed was a loud and distressed moan. Either way my mum heard me and came. My dad wasnt even there It was strange and terrifying. The weird part is that when I woke up the door wasn't open as much as in the dream and the light was off."
264,Very intense sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,3,"I had this very bizarre experience where I was in sleep paralysis for a good 10 minutes (or that’s what it felt like) and couldn’t get out no matter how hard I tried (I can usually get out in a couple of seconds), near the end of the paralysis my room started to get covered in this white cloth and out of nowhere I got slapped on the back and thrown across my room and out my window. Then I woke up and back was still hurting a little, luckily there wasn’t any weird handprint on my back that wouldn’t been so scary"
265,My sleep paralysis exp.,Sleepparalysis,4,"i experience s.p almost every night ,i have insomnia from the fear of it..before it happens my tinnitus gets louder...i believe its caused by demonic attacks though..sick people sometimes die in their sleep from sp cause they can't fight back thats my theory..if this is really a brain activity? Why does burning inscents help prevent it for a few nights?"
266,Had sleep paralysis at the same time in the same bed as my boyfriend,Sleepparalysis,14,"Me (18f) and my boyfriend (20) had sleep paralysis at the same time for the first time. It was very weird- I was hallucinating and hearing words I couldn’t make out and felt the need to check my surroundings and saw something standing over the bed. He woke up at the same time in a panic after being unable to move... and expressed that he heard heard a strange noise and felt really weird, like he was being touched. The vibes were off the rest of the night I felt horrible Energy in my room. it made it all seem more real that he experienced it as well, the negative energy wasn’t just in my head. What does this mean? Is this common? Really just my question is - what the fuck happened to us? Share your stories and why you think this happens. Like wss is paranormal, does it have something to do with the moon phases or what?"
267,What type of sleep paralysis is this,Sleepparalysis,12,so it would start and i would have a hard time breathing. i’m screaming but my voice isn’t heard. i try my hardest to snap out of it. it usually last for a minute. then i snap out of it. but then i feel so tired and fall back asleep in the span of 10 seconds and i’m experiencing sleep paralysis again. i would then repeat the cycle and a whole episode would last 30 mins. i am too tired to get out of bed and gather myself and would fall back asleep to sleep paralysis. i can’t find this type anywhere online.
268,I Had A Rather Disturbing Sleep Paralysis Hallucination And Need Help,Sleepparalysis,2,"Hello everyone, I have been experiencing sleep paralysis since I was 13 years old. Most of my hallucinations have been visual and audio based that was within the realms of reality. There was a particular sleep paralysis hallucination where a wardrobe in my room was replaced entirely by a darkened figure within a rocking chair haunched over. The darkened figure had their arms pulled forwards and was spinning a feminine mannequin head. The mannequin head was characterized with an angular face and sharp cheekbones. Small red lips of lipstick with red eyes and pure black hair that was shoulder length. As the mannequin head twirled it would slowly decay into a mess. Dirt, exposed flesh, and what I imagine was snot running down the face. The window on the opposition of my bed was a train going by with orange lights sprawling across my ceiling. It was not a dream as I moved as normal eventually and ran to the bathroom. I told a friend about this and they never had a sleep paralysis hallucination replace full objects. I am now concerned and need some help. I am willing to cooperate to the fullest extent of my knowledge and really need something to figure this out."
269,SP and horrible screams,Sleepparalysis,0,"Hi! Reading some posts I remebered one ocassion in which my SP started and as I ddint want to see weird things I closed my eyes... Suddenly I started hearing some people laughing like inocent children, after that voices transformed into terrible screams like if they were being torturated, I havent heard something as horrible as that even in movies.

Have you experienced something similar?"
270,I have SP episodes and now my BF can induce lucid dreams on me and stop SP without waking me up. Any toughts?,Sleepparalysis,1,"Hello everyone, I am a very athletic 23 year old girl. Throughout my life I have experienced strong SP episodes,  strong enough to even become cyclical dreams, lucid dreams and with out-of-body sensations.
Now II sleep with my boyfriend and he has helped me waking me up when I have SP, and watching me during my slepp. It often happens that after experiencing strong orgasms I fall into a deep sleep. Many times I experience SP, so he has been looking for creative ways to wake me up (it's very complicated). On the last occasions he has managed to make me interact with him, speaking to me while I sleep and that has caused him to guide lucid dreams. 
He can tell me something and then it happen in my dreams, I can eat whatever i want, fly, ride a bike or any strange creature and even ride a rollercoaster feeling absoluty everything.  Sometimes even dreaming about having sex. 
The last time it happen i was dreaming about a forest and 'something' (Sleep Demon) appeared, I was so scared that i could comunicate that to him so he started talking to me and tickle me(in real world). He appeared in my dream and the SD vanish 

Any similar situation?"
271,"Confused about my recent SP episode, been really paranoid.",Sleepparalysis,18,"I felt a presence during my SP episode for the first time and I wasn’t fully paralysed in bed this time, I was sitting up straight during the episode and felt like I was being pulled by these two black hands and was yelling for someone to come help me. This went on for a few minutes till I suddenly woke up. I don’t have much experience with SP episodes but from what I’ve read people are usually unable to talk and move. However, I was able to yell for someone and could move a little bit to try to break free from being pulled. Is this still an SP episode? I’m just really paranoid and haven’t been able to sleep properly since. I don’t believe in a paranormal presence or anything supernatural but my mental health has been at its lowest lately so my mind has been wandering to the darkest of places and i’ve been believing the worst in every situation which is why at the back of my head I believe that it might be paranormal and not psychological. If someone could tell me if what I’ve experienced is still just an SP episode that would really help."
272,Sleep Paralysis Only When Napping!?!,Sleepparalysis,12,"Anyone else only experience sleep paralysis when napping? Specifically when your about to wake up from the nap? I never experience SP when I’m sleeping through the night. 

I don’t see any shadows or figures above me or hear any odd noises.  However, I am able to see my surroundings, but remain unable to move or speak whatsoever.  It’s even happened in the car before (not driving obviously).  It usually ends with me panicking and forcing myself to fully wake up."
273,Fitbit Findings,Sleepparalysis,0,"Hey everyone! Does anyone else in here have a Fitbit and wear it to bed to track your sleep? I am curious as to whether or not your findings are similar to mine. I didn't sleep well last night, and ended up falling into a sleep paralysis spell in the morning before I was supposed to wake up. Knowing this, I looked at my Fitbit app, and I see that it shows me as being in a REM state for about 25 minutes, and then jumping to awake. I was stuck in it longer than normal, but I was also tired and didn't fight it. 
Anyone else have these findings?"
274,Experiencing sleep hallucinations or something else?,Sleepparalysis,3,"A few weeks ago, I went back to my house and went straight to bed at about 8 in the morning. I'm certain I was asleep, but it felt like my eyes were wide open, as I saw my whole room and my two dogs laying beside me like they were before I slept. I also heard some strange noises, some of were which like someone or something was walking hastily outside my room .my door was open and I wanted to check it out, but I couldn't move. I tried shouting and moving my hand, but to no avail, I couldn't. After a few minutes I could finally move. What did I experience?"
275,"Thinking about how disturbing it was the other night when I woke up from something squeezing my side in a dream and woke up still feeling an intense pain on my side, for at least a good few seconds",Sleepparalysis,15,"I’ve had plenty of sleep paralysis experience, especially when I was younger. This didn’t feel the same as the others tho. It was much shorter, and I didn’t know I was in it until I pondered on it later and linked the comparison of something putting force on me that i couldn’t see... knew it was nothing good though."
276,Sex With Myself,Sleepparalysis,10,Has anyone had sex with themselves during astral projection? As in your spirit is having sex with your body. That is the best I can describe it.
277,First time someone has appeared,Sleepparalysis,6,I've had sleep paralysis a few times but never was there a presence of anyone I just had sleep paralysis again and it was a little different I couldn't move and there was a light in my closet then I lock eyes with a 6ft man standing in there then after a few seconds everything goes black and I hear a ringing and I can hear myself scream internally while he is breathing on top of me I genuinely thought a man had entered my home because he looked like just a normal human I hear people describe demons but this was a human being
278,Almost died lol,Sleepparalysis,4,"So,
I just woke up from sleep paralysis. I didn’t see any terrifying figures and I wasn’t attacked during it. But, the scariest thing about this one experience was that I was so self aware during it that I thought to myself “okay, I hope I don’t stop breathing like last time”. But of course, because I thought it, it had to happen. 

So I was lying there, unable to breath and it was basically a race to see if I could break out of the paralysis before I actually suffocated. I’d rather the shadow people anyday...."
279,You sleeping paralysis experience?,Sleepparalysis,1,"Hey, i decided to post mine and hear about your experiences related to this. So we can maybe help each other understand this better. 
I have this happening to me occasionally, usually in the morning, rarely during the night.
Mine usually starts by hearing noises in the other room while fully aware im alone in the house in that moment. Also i can hear banging and knocking on the door or a doorbell. 
Than i feel like i have three shadows visiting me, always separately. Only when im alone in the house.

1st one seems tall and he usually quite, just looking at me.

2nd one seems like a crawler, noisy; making sneezing like sounds, hitting objects and his shadow i see moving quickly around the room. 

3rd one seems chubby and he interacts with me physically. He is noisy as well but aggressively. I can feel like he is sitting on my back, kinda shaking me ( like someone wants to wake you up aggressively ) putting some pressure like pressing me against the bed while im sleeping on the side. I also feel pain on the pressed part of the body after i wake up but it fades away after a few seconds. 

Honestly i am not sure what to believe when i read studies and opinions on this. It feels sooo real. And i feel weird all day long.

I am not using drugs, drinking or have necropsy as i noticed these were stated as possible causes in some medical researches. Also i wasn't jet lagged or tired when this happened.  So i really don't know and don't have any valid explanation i can trust fully.
 
What is so interesting for me is that we all have similar ""hallucinations"" and similar feeling while this is happening. 

What is your experience? 
And what explanation is more convenient for you : scientific or alternative?"
280,Im not like the rest,Sleepparalysis,8,I fell asleep tonight around 11 pm. I had a few crazy weird dreams where i felt a presence. I would wake up a minute get comfortable and fall back asleep. This happened all in one night. I was on my last dream before i finally woke up completely at 1:00am .. In the last dream there was an entity or demon of some kind standing in my closet room (which is connected to my bedroom) i went to try to fight it or something i ran into it. It was tall and long greyish black with no features. As i run twords it i am standing where it is and i feel faint and weak. Next thing i know im in my bed and my head is facing my wall to the right and im on my back. Im looking over and i see its face sort of and it looked evil like a grim reaper demon almost but it was shorter this time. It said I AM NOT LIKE THE REST. I couldnt move. I knew i was dreaming but i couldnt open my eyes or move or anything. My legs felt numb. I said to myself in my head jesus loves me over and over and about a minute later or so i was able to move and open my eyes. I cant sleep now. I am not a super religious person. I do believe but i have my doubts. I have never been baptized or anything like that. My family is Catholic though (grandmother and back in her days they were) my mom and i have never gone to church but maybe a few times when i was younger. I have recently started looking into the crystal healing and witchcraft stuff but i havent practiced any candle magic or spells. I would only do that with good intentions and if i knew what i was doing. But i do fully believe in all that stuff and i see it as my own spiritual way. I was watching some videos about this woman and her haunted house before I went to sleep. But i always do and watch scary movies alot too. Idk what that thing was but the fact that it SPOKE to me like in my head almost is what has gotten me awake and freaked out. My SO is asleep next to me but i cant fall back asleep. Has anyone else experienced this entity? Or what could my dream mean? I am cleansing tomorrow! Thank you so much . Blessed be.
281,How to purposely get sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,64,"I know people don’t really want sleep paralysis but I kinda wanna experience what it’s like. Is there any way that anyone knows of to get sleep paralysis? Or if u had sleep paralysis, what happened?"
282,Shadow being choking me,Sleepparalysis,7,"
I’ve had episodes of sleep paralysis before. Never like this. 
I was woken up by my fiancée coming to bed at 2:20 am after he fell asleep on the couch. I fell asleep in the bedroom with the light on (I’ve done this often lately as I  have recently become uneasy in the dark, like something is watching me) I remember him coming in and turning the light off and complaining about me having left it on again. It startled me awake, but I quickly fell back asleep. 
I dreamed my sister was in my living room and my mothers dog. My sister was sleeping on my couch and my fiancée was in bed with me and he all of the sudden woke up and said he needed to go to the bathroom (he does this usually all the time throughout the night). I knew deep down this was a dream because my sister lives in CA and I live in FL, but yet here she was. 
So my fiancée says he’s going to the bathroom, I hear him get up and the bathroom door close. 
I’m left alone in my bed and I feel something bump the bed from underneath, I turn to the other side -my fiancées side of the bed and I see it. A shadow being, no face, messy short hair, heavy male energy and very long pointy fingers. I’m paralyzed and I can’t speak. It looms above me and then it starts to choke me. I can’t breathe. Can’t move. Can’t scream. I eventually am able to get the words ‘help, please help’ and call out my fiancées name. It feels like forever and this thing feels like it’s killing me as it’s chocking me. Finally I’m able to turn my head to the other side and look away from this thing, I close my eyes and scream in my head ‘it’s not real it’s not real it’s just a dream’ I immediately wake up its 2:34 am (it felt like forever in my dream) I turn around and it’s very dark, I reach across my bed and my fiancée is there. I just held his hand and eventually fell back asleep. I didn’t dream after that, I woke up in the morning and my fiancée asks first thing, why were you screaming last night... Which immediately reminded me of the whole nightmare. 
I’ve been having a lot of nightmares lately, but I’ve never dealt with a shadow being trying to kill me. It’s usually people I know or animals, never some unknown entity. Plus my SP episodes are never this intense. I felt so helpless and scared.

I’m annoyed because I had been focusing on astral projecting and now I’m just too scared to even sleep. I’m 8 months pregnant with my 3rd child and my first pregnancy symptom has always been very vivid dreams, but I’ve never had nightmares like these.

 I don’t know if it matters but I saged the whole house earlier that day... so I don’t know if maybe I let something bad in or pushed all the good out."
283,I had quite the scare a few years ago. Does anyone else name their demons? Or is that a me thing.,Sleepparalysis,13,"SP, the minds way of messing with us.

I had one encounter with my sleep paralysis demon. I named it The Long One.

Does anyone else name their sleep paralysis demons?

[This is a long read but it's my story of my encounter with The Long One. ](https://www.reddit.com/user/EatsSoapOnTheDaily/comments/hzqim0/a_soap_eaters_sleep_paralysis_experience/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)"
284,Anyone else experience these visions?,Sleepparalysis,0,"Okay my SP started about 3 years ago maybe 4?..it started with the average weight on my chest and just fighting myself to be able to move to catch a breathe, but as time went on i began seeing things, like flash images, or even things moving around. Not just shadow people, but ive seen strange entities. Some times i do have a negative feeling seeing them and other times i dont. But im really curious about if this is common..last night i started having a spell, i was laying next to my girl, and ofcourse struggling with SP, but i kept seeing these 2 entities at the foot of our bed, to me they seemed female(idk guess thats the impression i got.) But their hands were on fire...for one flash theyd be moving back and forth and the next in my vision(or so i like to call them) all i seen was their hands touching our legs and then them laughing...the point of this is just seeing if others have similar experiences or maybe some help. I dont feel i have attachments im just curious..the entities ive seen are usually profound and specific."
285,How do you cope?,Sleepparalysis,8,"I'll be honest, I've thought about posting in this forum a few times to share my experience, but it is still too disturbing even for me. So I'll just ask the question without the experience. How do you cope with hallucinations in sleep paralysis? I get the full range from tactile, visual, and audible. They seem to be getting worse and it is causing me to lose a lot of sleep."
286,I’ve never had sleep paralysis with open eyes.,Sleepparalysis,9,"I always read about people getting sleep paralysis where their eyes are open they have crazy hallucinations and such... but my sleep paralysis happens with my eyes closed and I rarely experience any type of creepy auditory or any such hallucinations at all.  For me the scariest thing is how my breathing is automatic and often more shallow than I would like.  


What are some of your SP stories that freak you out about the phenomenon?"
287,Sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,11,"So I have a common state of sleep paralysis, at my old place it was normal to be greeted by the random figure in my room and being startled awake. Recent I had moved in with two of my friends, and I haven't quite noticed anything cause they tend to wake me up when they leave to go somewhere. Well today it was a normal day, I woke up to my roomates talking so I got up and made food. I timed something on the tv andnoticed I was still tired so I tried to take a nap in the recliner, this I had learned was a bad idea, an hour later I had woken up and heard a whisper say ""She is looking for you"" I was able to move my head so I thought it wasn't sleep paralysis, I tried to see who was talking then the same voice shouted "" She found you!"" My head snapped back to the chair and I could feel all my limbs being held down along with my head and neck. I screamed help but to me it sounded raspy like I was saying nothing, so I tried to move and knock something over but whatever was holding me down stopped me completely. I screamed for help again and I heard my roomates door slam open. My roomate, who is starting he first year as a nurse was running to me, I was facing the other way, I was finally able to move and took a deep breath in, she had said ""I had heard a noise but thought it was the tv, then I heard it again so I came out and heard a faint 'help help' and came running to you, you shot up like you have been underwater for a while and started breathing frantically."" My limbs all are sore like I had been working out and my neck hurts, I can still remember every detail in that moment but I want to be sure it is in fact sleep paralysis, cause that was the most intense episode of it I've ever had."
288,Is my experience sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,7,"This happened at about 5am this morning and it's pretty foggy in my mind but I don't know if this was just part of a dream or sleep paralysis, I remember waking up and not being able to move so then I realised what was happening so I shut my eyes to not see anything scary since I get very scared easily and all I remember was hearing lots of voices and the feeling of being touched by cold hands, was this sleep paralysis or just part of a dream since I don't remember waking up straight after it happened"
289,I just had sleep paralysis for the first time and idk what to do,Sleepparalysis,26,"I’ve never really had many dreams, let alone sleep paralysis but at 4 this morning I did. It was a dream at first. In the dream I woke up and my room was dark, but there was a spotlight on a German Shepard in the corner. It started to speak english, then realized I was awake, stopped, charged me, and bit my neck. Then all of a sudden I’m back laying in my bed and I’m getting choked by two hands. My body starts shaking like I’m having a seizure. My eyes are wide open. I can’t breathe. My body stops shaking. And after like 3 seconds of trying to force myself to move my shoulder finally twitches. I regain control of my body and I jolt up, terrified. Idk what to do. I’m still horrified. Someone pls help me"
290,Longtime SP'ers,Sleepparalysis,3,"For those of you who've had episodes of sleep paralysis for an extended period of time, how would you describe your experience? What is it like when you get episodes now? How long and frequently have you been getting them, and did they start when you were a child or later in life?

I'm 20 years old and I've been getting SP ever since I was about 8. It happens as infrequently as once in 6 months and as frequently a few times in one week. I get a strange feeling before it happens and sometimes can prevent it. It doesn't scare me so much as it annoys me. I don't hallucinate and I have improved control over my body (since I know which parts are easiest to try to budge). It usually takes less than 15 seconds for me to snap out of SP now.

How does your experience compare?"
291,oh oh oh!! it got more intense for me,Sleepparalysis,0,"i've been experiencing SP from highschool. it comes with from just seeing shadows, voices, got air blown in my ear like someone blow a candle, and the more i grow up, it got more close(?) to me...?

this time i was dreaming i was asleep and got SP in it (i saw me in a third person). when i realize it was just a dream, the SP seems to stop. i tried to have a reality check by tring to look down at my fingers, but it was hard, i saw nothing but bright lights and none of my hands. and then it changes from third person to my pov lying down on my stomach just like in real life. but then, something towering over me on the edge of the foot bed. it started poking my lower back, and then goes up on my arms, and my nape before it whisper something with a women voice. it was like calling me, i felt like it was a warning too (shoot i don't remember). when it move i felt that it was standing on my bed, beside me, the bed and the sheets felt like it was moving, like there was really something on my bed. and then i realize i'm alone at home, it was not hard to open my eyes because (idk what gotten into me) i want to see what it was. nothing. and i awoke. i tried to close my eyes again, hoping that i can continue it or at least took a journey to have lucid dream but it was not working.

idk why i feel like it got more intense than before."
292,Can you guys share your sleep paralysis stories? I want to better understand what happened to me and what it means.,Sleepparalysis,2,"I’ve only ever experienced about 4 of them but recently I experienced a stronger one. Usually I just feel paralyzed, can’t speak, and I see a dark figure in the corner of the room. Always the corner. It lasts about 2 minutes or so. This recent one though, lasted about 6 minutes and it was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced in my life.

So recently I have been trying to fix my my sleeping schedule so I have been going to sleep at around 8/9 in the night and waking up everyday at 5am. Now, since I’m barley starting it’s not easy and I don’t wake up with 100% energy. I try to keep myself moving so I won’t fall asleep. This way I can go to sleep at 8/9 without any problems. The reason I do this is because I have trouble sleeping so every single night I take a sleeping pill and I’m trying to get off those. You know, stop depending on them?

So one day I woke up at 5am and I share a room with my sister and my mom wakes up at 5am to go to work. So once she leaves, I brush my teeth, wash my face, make myself some breakfast and head to her room to watch some Netflix. I usually watch the TV sitting up in order to not fall asleep but this day I wasn’t feeling too good so I laid on my back while still watching Netflix. I wasn’t planning on going to sleep.

I just want to add that I NEVER sleep on my back. It’s just kind of uncomfortable for me. I’m a side sleeper. BUT, everytime I’ve experienced sleep paralysis, I was on my back. I don’t know why this happens so if someone could explain that to me, that’d be nice.

So anyways, it was around 10 when I had finished making breakfast and watched a couple of hours of Netflix. Now I know I said I try to keep myself moving but around this time my mind is 100% awake and I’m not sleepy anymore so I just stay watching Netflix until I have to do something else. But like I said, this day I wasn’t feeling too good.

I was watching Netflix and I didn’t really notice at what point I had fallen asleep. I started having a “dream” where there was a man inside of the room and he was sexually abusing me. I have never ever experienced anything like that and in my dream I could FEEL the pressure on me and my thighs. I was yelling and crying in my dream. The room was dark because my mom has black curtains so I couldn’t see the man in my dream. The man then ran out of the room and I don’t quite remember what happened in between this time period but I then started hearing metal clanging right outside of the room. The door was closed and I just knew it was the man. I was so scared I started crying and hyperventilating in my dream and in real life. At this time I thought I was awake and this stuff was actually happening. It all felt so real. I was laying on my back, my body was stiff and I couldn’t move. My eyes were open and I was staring right at the door. I heard the man outside of the bedroom and he was yelling like a maniac, he was clanging on what sounded like metal bars. It sounded like a warehouse. Everything echoed and I heard multiple clanging noises even though there was one man. The sound got closer and closer to the bedroom as he was getting closer and closer. I felt my arms and legs start to shake as I was making so much force trying to get up. I was still paralyzed and I could feel the tears falling down my cheek. I was terrified. The clanging and the yelling man got closer and closer and the closer it got the more terrified I became, once the noise got as close as the door, my body shot up so quickly and I moved to the opposite side of the door expecting the man. I looked all around the room for signs of the man. Still crying. It wasn’t until about 5 minutes later that I realized he wasn’t real and I was just dreaming. It felt so damn real, I will never forget that day."
293,First time happening to me; I thought I was going to die from an earthquake,Sleepparalysis,0,"Hey guys, this is my first post here, and seeing another couple of posts, I think I had sleep paralysis. First, I didn’t see nor hear anything from what I remember, and I also could move, at least after the worst had happened anyway. My boyfriend suffers from constant sleep paralysis, and ever since we moved together he told me they got better, so he was the one to tell me I might have had it. I was woken up because I felt a horrible shake. I felt as if something was dragging my body and bed extremely hard. I live in a highly seismic zone (the strongest and mos destructive one I’ve lived was of 7.1), so earthquakes are a bit normal to us.  

Anyway, I felt as if that was it for me, as soon as I woke up I sprinted towards the door and tried to wake my boyfriend to tell him it was shaking. As soon as we turned on the lights, we saw the water in our nightstands be completely still and saw it was in fact *not* shaking so I started to panic really bad because then I didn’t know what had happened to me. My boyfriend told me ""From how you’re saying it, it looks like you had a sleep paralysis minus the visual and auditory hallucinations"" And I do believe too, that’s what happened to me. I don’t remember having a bad dream before it happened, and to be quite honest, I couldn’t remember at all what I was dreaming about. Jokingly I told him ""Well, I don’t know, but if it ever happens again to me, I won’t doubt a second to sprinkle some holy water in our house"" and tried to get back to sleep. He also told me I was lucky it was all physicall and not how they usually go because I can imagine they can be quite scary. 

The strange think for me was that as soon as I felt it, I literally jumped from my bed and sprinted towards the door. I thought you couldn’t move *at all* with sleep paralysis, and I’m thinking  the fact I live in a highly seismic area had maybe something to do with it. Maybe it triggered my subconscious fight or flight response? I don’t know guys, but I really, really, reaaaally do hope it never happens to me again. I’ve never felt such terror as this one before and now I’m scared to go to sleep :("
294,I need help with my sleep paralysis.,Sleepparalysis,13,"Hello!

Could you write your technique for getting into sleep paralysis?

I imagine the golden aura, but it doesn't work.

I really need your answer.

Thanks for your help."
295,"I'm Scared To Go To Sleep Because I Have Nightnares, Help?",Sleepparalysis,35,"It may sound stupid, but I've been bullied all my life up until now I'm 20, grew up in a abusive home, not to mention have 0 friends. I have really bad nightmares and they scare me to death and leave me paranoid sometimes even make me cry, they are so vivid and real i swear it actually happend to me. Afterwards i can't sleep so i stay up all night and do nothing. This has been going on no word of a lie for about 2 almost 3 years i can't even remember the last time I had a good amount of rest, I refuse to sleep now because of this."
296,Did I just experience sleep paralysis ?,Sleepparalysis,1,"I was dreaming just now, 2:32 am, then suddenly i’m awake and I can see a dark figure in the corner of my room, it brings true fear upon my body and I couldnt move, it lasted about 10 seconds.
EDIT: 2:41 am , also felt this weird feeling in my chest, and I currently have goosebumps all over my body that I can’t get rid of"
297,Black chain hovering like a dna model,Sleepparalysis,0,"So this has happend 3 times where I wake up, look and see a dark chain, twisted a little like a double helix off the the side of me, like 6 feet away. It might be a re occurring dream part of it, I have had sp probably 2 times a month ( not bad, just feel like I'm not getting enough air and cant move, I end up shaking myself out of it) I'm getting looked at soon for sleep abnia, but I wanted to see if anyone else has seen this. Again, I dont see anything/anyone when I experience the sp, but afterward/ if I wake up outa no where I'll see that black chain. It's not spooky when I see it, it's just there then it goes away, half asleep I just asked my wife if she saw it and she had no idea what I was talking about."
298,I think i solved my sp problems temporally,Sleepparalysis,11,"I bought melatonin tablets online because i got a job thats during the night so i had to change my sleeping schedule. But before that i would get sleep paralysis often especially if i try to lucid dream again, out of the 3 times i opened my eyes 2 was nothing but once i saw black hands coming out the wall trying to get me, from then on i close my eyes to wait it out. Now that i take the melatonin to change my sleeping schedule i havent had sp for 2 months. (Btw i just found this sub).


UPDATE: i think its okay still but i still need it for my job. on my off days tho when i dont take it i noticed sp is way more intense. this time something was screaming and it caressed my ass which lowkey freaked me out. just to be clear i dont recommend buying pill online cuz i probably got the habit forming kind of pills but its effective so far."
299,Boyfriend wants to experience SP even though I told him it’s terrible,Sleepparalysis,8,"I’ve been having SP for about like 6 years. It’s always been horrible, yet only rarely do I see figures/shadows because i force myself to keep my eyes shut whenever it happens.

Anyways, I have opened up about my SP to my friends and family. It turns out my sister (who has a room next to me) experiences SP too. But my other sister, doesn’t experience it and neither do my parents. 

I told my boyfriend about this ever since we were began dating which was about a year and a half ago. He’s always said that he wants to experience it. I told him that it is absolutely terrifying and I wish that feeling on no one. But he doesn’t care, his mind won’t change. I don’t know how to get through to him. SP has been traumatic for me in the past. It gives me a lot of anxiety and feelings of terror when I’m in it. I don’t know, I just need help on how to make him realize how horrible it is for me and that he should never wish it upon himself."
300,The woman in the portal,Sleepparalysis,5,"When I was younger, around 15 and going through a bunch of messed up stuff (depression, being expelled from school and my parents locking me in my room for 3 months) and essentially going insane, I experienced my first (and only) sleep paralysis demon. To start with some background I was never a good kid in highschool, i was constantly getting into trouble and starting shit with my family. I was the outcast since I was into heavy metal and into darker stuff like the occult. I went to sleep one night and woke up in my bed 9n my back completely paralyzed and dazed. I started to look around my room confused when I noticed there was a black circle above my window (my room was on the second floor of my house) and that it was growing bigger and something started to come out of it. First it was a hand, long boney fingers as if someone took a vacuum and sucked out all the blood and fat, then an arm and another hand and arm as well, then the head. It was a female head, mouth ripped open and a black void inside, her eyes were sucken in and void of any color, not even black or white just...empty. black ooze started dripping from her mouth and she began to pull herself out of the portal, her body mangled and broken with her skin stretch and sunken in, exposing the bones poking through the leathery flesh. Her arms were ungodly long as was her neck, her mouth opened at least 3 times as wide and she let out a truly horrifying scream that sounded like a mixture of a baby crying, a woman screaming, a dog yiping in pain and a low guttural growl all at once. As she slowly pulled herself out, all i could say was ""WHO ARE YOU?"" over and over and over again attempting to move from my paralyzed state. I feel as if she gave me her name but I truly cannot remember it, which I'm sure is what she wanted. She twisted and mangled her own body in such ways that shouldn't be physically possible. I can't exactly remember if she came fully out of the portal or not and I don't remember waking up that next morning either or really the rest of my time locked in my room. After that its all a blur up until I went back to school and ever since I always feel as if there is a woman demonic spirit trying to get me, and I have trained myself to never fall asleep on my back again. While I remain an atheist today this, I will never forget what I saw that night and still have no idea if it was real or not. I truly wonder if it has to do with what I did when I was 12. By which I mean, I drew a pentagram and cut myself putting the blood in each point and the center while saying a prayer to Satan, then when it was done I folded the paper and burned it. Ever since I literally, cannot believe in God and every time I try to go to God my life goes into shit and ruin, so i of course resort back to being an atheist every single time. Anybody have any advice or know the meaning of this demon portal woman? Have any of you see her as well? I can't be alone on this one."
301,SP and bad night vision,Sleepparalysis,0,"I've had tactile hallucinations before, but it's been a while. I realized it's kind of strange that I've never had any visual hallucinations. My night vision is terrible though: not only is my glasses prescription -7, but I also have [visual snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow), so everything is already terribly dark and fuzzy and shifting at night.

If I were to ever visually hallucinate, would my vision suddenly become clear? Or would my brain  know enough to project a staticky demon onto my night vision? Are the hallucinations 100% in my head like a dream, or are they  projected onto my actual vision, like augmented reality?  When I'm dreaming usually it's extremely nonvisual and more composed  of impressions and working with the  concepts of what's supposed to be there.  Wondering if SP demon would be the  same, and my sleep mask/horrible vision wouldn't spare me from ""knowing"" it's there."
302,Do you ever experience your whole face tightening as your falling asleep?,Sleepparalysis,1,"I usually have this happen just as I'm dozing off, and I feel like i can't even breathe for a few seconds. Usually happens as i feel like I'm fading into a dream."
303,Multiple SP episodes back to back,Sleepparalysis,4,"Recently I’ve had a few experiences with my SP which have been so bad it’s really put me off sleeping. I’ll fall asleep and not long after falling asleep, maybe 10-20 minutes later (I’m able to determine how long I’ve been asleep because I fall asleep watching a film or YouTube) I will wake to SP. I’ll do my breathing routine and keep myself calm as possible and when I snap out of it and come back to my body if I don’t get up and go have a cig or go to the bathroom I find myself slipping straight back into another SP episode. It’s been so bad the one time that I fell asleep and in my dream I was having SP, and was shaken by a friend of mine in the dream to then wake up with actual SP again IRL... The most it’s happened I’d say is 3-4 times in a row in the space of a few hours if that. Was just wondering if anyone had any similar experiences or stories regarding multiple SP attacks like this. The only fix to this I’ve found is like I mentioned before, getting up out of bed and doing something like smoking a cig or having a cup of tea / water for 10-20 minutes before going back to sleep to avoid getting into that horrible cycle."
304,"Not really sure what was happening, but I was pretty terrified until I had control again.",Sleepparalysis,2,"About a year ago I bought a house and starting living alone. A few months of me living there and everything seemed normal and fine except one morning. 

One morning I woke up and felt like I was pinned down and the my bed was moving towards the door and back towards my wall. All I remember is trying my hardest to move, but I felt paralysed. I don't have history of sleep paralysis and I also have a hard time believing in ghosts, but this was a pretty crazy experience. 

Nothing has happened since that morning, but I still don't know what was happening that morning."
305,How to have Lucid dream will n SP?,Sleepparalysis,4,"Please help me to understand how I can have this experience. I have read on a few statuses how people have lucid dreams while having an SP episode. 

Can someone help me please?"
306,Get a dog,Sleepparalysis,19,"Hi all just wanted to share my experience with sleep paralysis over the years and how my two doggies have been life changing for me. 

My first sleep paralysis was when I was 6 years old. I'll never forget it as I was sleeping between my mother and father and wide awake talking to my father. I felt two hands grab my ankles and pulled me down to the foot of the bed. Awaiting me was a skull which immediately laughed at me. I then realized I could not move or make a sound. All of a sudden I heard my parents call out to me and snapped out of it. From their perspective I suddenly made struggling noises. I was too afraid to tell them what it was. 

Didn't have any more episodes until 4th grade when I was 9 years old or so. Damn 4th grade. Every. Single. Night. All sorts of ways you have read about. Shadows. Noises. Pressure. I was so young and scared back then. After that year I'd have on average an episode a month. In my 20s started dropping to every month or so, and in my 30s every 3 to 6 months. 

Well about two years ago I got a puppy. He's a good boy, very alert and protective of his happy space with his family. I went abour a year without an episode. Then the 1 time i got an episode... Heard two female voices from my wall and boom was on me and I couldn't move. My good boy barks agressively snapping me out of it. And as I come to, he is staring at my door making growling noises. I smile and go to sleep. Good boy. 

I now added another good boy to my family. I now have more love and companionship in my life. And the sleep paralysis and other shit that goes bump in the night is now eradicated. Good luck out there and stay safe."
307,Has anyone ever been touched irl when having sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,6,"I’ve had sleep paralysis so many times in my life... Doesn’t really bother me anymore
But I’ve never been touched or moved by someone while having sleep paralysis, so I’ve always been curious what would happen. I always imagined that it would suddenly snap me back into being able to move, but idk. 

Has anyone here ever been moved/touched by someone while having SP? And what happened?

*touched by a real life person, like a family member or a partner..."
308,"As people with sleep paralysis, What are y'all's thoughts on the original nightmare on elm street?",Sleepparalysis,8,I know what happens in the movie & in real life are completely different experiences i'm just curious.
309,"New in the sub and feeling identified with your posts, my 1st exp was....",Sleepparalysis,3,"Hi! I have experimented this condition/problem since I was 12 (almost 30) and believe me reading some of your posts makes me feel that I am not Alone and I am amazed of the similarities of some experiences you described and mines.....

My first experience with SP was wierd one: I was tryng to sleep when I wasnt able to move my body but my eyes and head. After that I saw an Aztec sun been reflected in my room's wall, it just was there moving from one side to another one in the same wall, I suffered anxiety .....

That one was a weird one but I Will share some scary and cool experiences under that mental state"
310,Forced into submission and shown images,Sleepparalysis,8,"I usually try to avoid sleep paralysis because it feels like my body is being pulled by chains until finally I can't resist it.

But lately its been going to a whole other level, I close my eyes to escape the sights that await me because I heard stories about it being bad, but terrifying images of black and white landscapes and dead trees + shadow figures around me are starting to form with my eyes closed which never happened to me as a kid, but I everything was slowing progressing until this morning.

&#x200B;

I was sleepy and got pulled into sleep paralysis and was greeted by the terrible land scapes but **It was so real that it felt like a I was wearing a VR headset,**  I was shown disgusting images of a distorted girl who looked like she had the face of a demon and 1920's cartoon like faces flashed in front of me that looked angry and had the background of a yellow film, I felt like I was being ripped out of my self, but I breathed throughout my nose and came back to my senses gasping for ear.

&#x200B;

has anyone had an episode like this? I'm terrified and don't know what to do if it happens again."
311,What’s the scariest apparition you’ve seen till date when having sleep paralysis ?,Sleepparalysis,7,Just curious guys
312,Same “man”,Sleepparalysis,3,"I have had the same demon for years. He comes in different forms but has the same sinister like laugh he makes when I realize it’s him. Sometimes I’ll fall asleep and start dreaming and then realize it’s “him” and then be instantly sucked back into full on sleep paralysis. These times are the hardest to shake because my body is so far asleep. 

Fwiw, I don’t believe for a second that it’s hallucinations. I’ve been dealing with the same problem multiple times a week for 25+ years."
313,Naked bald baby sitting on my chest.,Sleepparalysis,3,"So I was taking a nap around 1 only to undergo sleep paralysis. I didn’t really feel anything else other then a lot of pressure on my chest and stomach. I could kinda move I guess. At first before I opened my eyes I thought it was my cat so I tried to nudge him off but when I opened my eyes there was this random naked bald baby sitting on my chest (with its head and back facing towards me). Then when I nudged it the thing just got up and left down the hallway past my mom who was folding laundry in the hallway (which in fact was actually happening irl at that time). 

Idk the whole thing was just so weird."
314,A try hard SP,Sleepparalysis,2,"Before I got used to sleep paralysis I have had it almost every night more than once, there was that one time I got really annoyed then everything got insane.
First my bed started floating then it went outside my room, there were 2 hallways, one of them is way scarier than the other, luckily I was able to not look there then my bed went to the less Scary one and there were literally all kinds of sounds and images that you might see In a horror movie.
There were arms and eyes on the walls, someone looking from a window
Quick and small steps behind me and doors opening, even I thought this was too much then at the end there was a door opening with that little girl behind it
I felt that jumpscare moment coming but then I woke up....
And I was disappointed for some reason
And I thought there is no way anything can be scarier
Maybe I'm wrong?
I still get lots of sleep paralysis so I might find something better"
315,In control of the SP?,Sleepparalysis,0,"Hey! First time posting on this sub so whats up. My sleep schedules been very ass this past few days due to a change in my work. And i noticed i had a couple SP episodes during my naps. Today i decided to take a nap hoping i’d have another and hoping i can understand it while in it literally. I usually have SP 1-2 time a year so this recent jump in numbers was worrying me 🤷🏻‍♂️ what can i do. Regardless, my dream was me watching pewds play a game ( literally what i was doing prior to the nap) and then suddenly my brain woke up and realized the SP. numb body, my hearing was still the dream and my left eye was closed and still vividly seeing the dream visuals. All the points checked out and i figured might as well fuck around. I started by moving one finger at a time, thumb to finger for each my hands and feet. Trued moving my entire body but that basically messed me up cause the dream started distorting the more i tried moving. Got to a point where it was just intense static audio and the visuals of the “pewdiepie gaming video” were hella distorted, but when i stopped... the dream went on. J couldve just slept but honestly thats when a lil anxiety pulled up cause i kept wondering “hey what if i cant wake up anymore?” In the end i did my usual 3-2-1 countdown and jerked my leg resulting in me waking up. Idk what this says about SP, maybe nothing maybe useful, i just felt like sharing!"
316,Dreams about having sleep paralysis ?,Sleepparalysis,1,"I don’t really know how to explain this, but I usually have dreams about sleeping (going to sleep) only to find sleep paralysis happening (usually in a mild form). So I get those buzzing noises, pins and needles, and chest compressions but no actual other stuff. Then I’ll just casually wake up knowing some how it was a dream and not the real thing the next morning ??"
317,Something creepy about my sleep,Sleepparalysis,0,"(THIS IS A CROSS POST FROM ASKDOC SUB)
I not sure how to properly crosspost. Please correct me if there's other way. I figured out since there's something freaky with my sleep, I'll post it here too to see if I got any suggestions.



Background: male/23/ 176 cm/ 75 kg(my weight doesn't change much since I was 15) / frequent smoker/ frequent work out (5day per week, 2 hour per day)/ diet: mostly processed and unhealthy food

_

Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but this is sleep related issue. Since I was a kid, I've always has problems with being awake from sleeping. I always thought that I'm just being lazy and doesn't felt like want to wake up. But thing start to get weird whenever someone watch me sleep.

_

1) the first time I noticed, is that my brother told me that I've been sitting up for few times (this is only include the time he saw me sleeping in the living room which is quite rare.)  But I never walk.

_

2) there's once I sit up and looks for thing underneath the chair I'm sleeping on.

_

3) I talk, smile, laugh a lot when I'm asleep. Most of the time it gibberish.

_


4) I'll answer whenever someone ask me a question. Sometime accurate answer, sometime gibberish.

_

5) I once wake up with a bloody fist and wall. I'm punching the wall till I'm awake

_

6)I'll always close my alarm without waking up. Even with the type of alarm where it force you to do math. So I can do math while I'm asleep. This has caused me to not sleep at all if I have important things to do in the following day.

_

>Above is mostly notice by my brother only when I slept in the living room, which is not frequent.

_


__________________________________________________
>Below is thing noticed by my partner

_

6) she tries touching, pinching, kissing me a lot, and I won't be awake.

_

7)she even tries something more aggressive things like undressing me without me waking up.

_


8) she literally opened my eyelid and my eyes are wide open that are really red and some eye movement. (She recorded this incident, it freak me out. I look like I'm dead.)

_

All this thing happens throughout the years frequently, same goes to the thing what my partner did to me. (I think she's been doing experiment with me while I'm asleep lol)and I don't have any memory with any of this.

_

Is this some kind of illness? I don't really care about the freaky part. But I really hope I could wake up like a normal person and I could wake up on time. This has been causing some issues to my school and job throughout the years. And money is a big issue for me at this stage of my life. So if possible I hope it can be solved without visiting anyone. 

_

Edit: just wanna said thanks a lot in advance for reading my really long text. And I'm trying to refer some of the background of other post about what to write."
318,Neutral sleep paralysis ?,Sleepparalysis,4,"So, I'm pretty sure I'm experiencing sleep paralysis. I read the post here describing common symptoms and I definitely can't move, speak, open my eyes, have no sense of how much time is passing... But that's pretty much it. I have no negative feelings. It's literally just like my body is asleep & my mind is still awake. If I fight it, I can feel my heart rate speed up and get a little anxious so I learned pretty quick to not fight it. It's like I am just waiting for my body to be done sleeping. I can still hear everything going on around me, I can feel the different patterns of breathing that occur during sleep, and my fingers sometimes twitching. So I definitely know I'm sleeping, at the very least. It's very bizarre and only ever happens when I take a nap. Does anyone else have the same experience?"
319,First post on here :),Sleepparalysis,0,"Had a strange experience last night as I was drifting asleep I found myself instantly frozen and not able to move a second or so into this I hear clear as day a natural sounding robotic voice clear as day say “initiating communication you can hear me yes”, (said somthing else after that somthing like two more sentences and then stopped) and the paralysis went away soon as it started I was left feeling really excited because I’ve always been fascinated with aliens and had sleep paralysis before but never heard such a clear consciousness and calming voice come from within seemed one hundred percent intelligent and I almost woke up my girlfriend but quickly forgot the exact words the voice said and brushed it off and went to bed. I know not everyone is convinced in alien life but I believe I had a brief exciting experience I’ll never forget the crystal clear voice like I heard it in my ear not my mind really calming and concise with somewhat strange grammatical ordering of the sentences. Have anyone else experienced such a voice In sleep paralysis? It almost made me more excited than afraid which is strange as I have sleep paralysis a lot and can never breathe feel like ima die."
320,Literally felt like somebody was peeling the skin of my skull and opening my head up exposing my brain while holding me down.,Sleepparalysis,7,"I was just thinking deeply laying on my stomach before I know it I'm unable to move. ""oh just another episode, let's just move our toes soon to be over"", I think to myself. I move my toes, nothing happens after 30 seconds or so. NOW we know we are in some DEEP SHIT. I started to hear two men with cockney accents shouting, arguing with each other. I tried to listen but couldn't make out the words. My attention quickly spat to my head trying to move it. I could move it a couple centimetres at BEST, when I did it violently shook. I felt something hold my head and legs down. I was calm until I felt the sensation of my scalp being gently peeled off. It wasn't painful but it was beyond odd and the high frequency vibrations in my head didn't help. I was panicking wanting to see whatever was doing this to me before long it stopped and I felt two hands gently go up my legs strangely calming me down. Let's say I didn't sleep soon after the outlandish experience."
321,Sp is ruining me.. rape/hallucinations,Sleepparalysis,46,"I’m gonna start this off by saying I’m 17 and first experienced sleep paralysis probably when I was 10.
I didn’t know what it was at the time, I kinda just shrugged it off as some type of dream since nothing really happened besides the paralyzed part ofc (no shadows, sounds, etc) It never really happened to me that much back then, maybe like once or twice a year or a couple of times a month, honestly I don’t remember but I just remember it not being all that bad.

Now a few months back I woke up to sleep paralysis and for the first time I saw a shadow on top of me.  It shook me so much that just seeing it woke me up in a second so i couldn’t really figure out what it was but I know I saw it.  After that encounter my sp just got worse and worse to the point where I even experienced RAPE... I couldn’t believe it, the whole time I was telling my self it’s a hallucination but after that experience there’s just no way it can be IT HAS to be something bc I even felt pleasure?? like I didn’t like it but I definitely felt pleasured.  (To clarify I’m a straight male and the rape that was happening to me was penetration so that just fucks w me even more...) The next night or a few nights later IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  Then a few nights after that it happened.. again.... except this time there was no pleasure just pure pain.. It felt like it lasted forever and there was nothing I could do about it, couldn’t move, couldn’t open my eyes, couldn’t call for help... I try calling out for God but even that doesn’t work for me. 

After those 3 encounters I started sleeping on my back bc since I used to sleep on my stomach I thought that made it able to rape me.  This did stop it for a little while, it went back to normal sp with nothing really happening, maybe static sounds a couple of times but nothing too bad.  Then just after I thought I found a way around it, it happened AGAIN.  Though this time I don’t think it was like sex or anything but more of sexual harassment like I can feel something going inside of me but it’s not the same as b4 so I think it’s a finger..?? Idk but this happens repeatedly now every time I have sp that happens and even sometimes I can feel someone poke at my private... I just can’t take it anymore I want it to stop Im already depressed w really bad social anxiety this does not make it any better now I’m scared just to sleep bc it’s starting to happen almost every other day .. plz help or atleast let me know if uve experienced anything like this i just don’t know what to do anymore.  

i really don’t think I’m hallucinating it’s all too real the pleasure/pain AND I EVEN FEEL STUFF AFTERWARDS like after the 3rd rape I could barely sit in my fucking chair right... 

Just wanna clarify one more thing, I don’t drink, I don’t do drugs, I’ve never hallucinated b4 besides that one time in sp, and I’m not even diagnosed with anything so this all has to be real, it’s spiritual I believe it bc that’s the only way I can make some type of sense off of these encounters 

TL;DR I’ve been having sexual encounters in sp that I strongly believe are real/not hallucinations and would like to know anything that could help it stop or if you or someone u know experienced the same thing"
322,Insomnia because of SP,Sleepparalysis,1,"I suffer from anxiety and severe depression. For years I've taken sleeping pills because I'm not able to fall asleep on my own. This is because if I do because my body is too tired I get sleep paralysis constantly, literally non stop from the moment I fall asleep until the morning when I give up and get up. Every time I wake up from a SP my eyes will just shut down and a sinking feeling of another episode gives me chills and happens all over again. I literally KNOW when I'm going to have SP. 
Pills worked fine for a while but I want to try and figure out why the fuck the sleeping paralysis is SO SEVERE. And also is coming back and happening again even with the sleeping pills. (I did ask my psychiatrist but he says is only stress)
Can I ask for tips or how did you got better?"
323,Hands feet under the blanket,Sleepparalysis,5,"I have had sleep paralysis since I was just a little kid. Multiple times a week for 25 years, still terrifies me. 

What gets me the most is my hands and feet. If they are exposed from the blanket it’s as if I have zero protection, but if they are underneath the covers, I get simply tormented, not “taken”. Can’t explain it other than that. I have massive anxiety about falling asleep without a blanket over my hands and feet, in case “he” comes. 

(Fwiw, I don’t believe this to be a “hallucination”, sleep paralysis is too real, and similar amongst so many.)"
324,Does past trauma have an effect on what you see or feel?,Sleepparalysis,3,0
325,How do I get sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,9,0
326,Sleep paralysis in my dream???,Sleepparalysis,1,"Ok has anyone else had this experience before? When I get sleep paralysis it’s usually when I fell INTO sleep, not when I come out of it. So I don’t get hallucinations or anything just feels like I can’t breathe. However recently, I’ll get sleep paralysis and do my thing of trying to wake myself up, I’ll either wake up or continue to struggle. Then... I’ll ACTUALLY wake up. If that makes sense? Usually when I’m struggling or “wake up” the first time I’ll be somewhere completely different or the time won’t be the same so that’s how I know it’s a dream. 
For example, I fell asleep on the couch around 9 am after dropping my mom off at work around 8. In my dream I’m still on the couch but my mom is back and it’s 7 pm with a sunset in the background. And in this dream I have sleep paralysis. I’m struggling to wake up, even opening my eyes a few times to see my mom at the end of the couch, then “fall back asleep” in my dream. Then my mom would touch my arm to bring me food and I’d wake up.. then fall back asleep. This would happen a few times that I actually believed it was 7 pm and my mom has come back from work. It was only until I actually woke up that i realized it’s 10 am lol. This has happened a few times before where I was in weirder places or in weirder dream situations. Has this happened to anyone else?"
327,Feeling pain after waking up from sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,"I almost always feel pain during sleep paralysis, and I often feel as if something is pinching me. The pain doesn't bother me that much, but the strange thing is that I still can feel pain even after I wake up. The pain starts to actually go away after 3-5 minutes. Have anyone else also experienced things similar to this?"
328,Giving myself bruises?,Sleepparalysis,2,I’ve been having sp but also feeling and seeing myself get grabbed by my hips or thighs pulled to the foot of my bed and lifted up and I can see myself being “held up” in the mirror. When I wake up in the morning I find bruises in the area or my legs I felt grabbed. Now I have a pretty physical job so I could maybe just be projecting but I’ll have like multiple linear bruises that look like fingers. I’m thinking I may be grabbing myself or something while I’m sleeping but I’m a little confused because I’m supposed to be paralyzed lol. Does anyone else do anything similar.
329,My first and only time so far with sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,"This happened around a month ago, so on the day after the last day of school I was up early in the morning at 2 and I couldn't go back to sleep. I decided to get my phone and start doing whatever with the phone. So multiple times I went back to sleep on the couch for a bit before waking up. I was also super paranoid some creature was lurking at night ready to kill me  (pretty stupid I know but I'm an insanely paranoid person) So nearly as the pitch dark night turned into a more morning feel I close my eyes and then instantly open them. I saw this powder white skinny creature, face very mangled. He was walking towards me but when I opened my eyes I saw it transform into a grandma looking figure, and then it just transformed into a cardboard robot that slowly walked to the side of my couch I was sitting on (wild but very terrifying) I felt like I was there and it was real cause my phone's audio was still playing as I was watching a video. And I couldn't move, I tried moving and soon enough I was able to move but for a second while I was able to move and the weird cardboard robot thing was walking towards me it was still moving. I was so petrified  after the matter I spent 2 days sleeping with my dad in the living room."
330,New demon,Sleepparalysis,1,"Usually the “demon” in my sleep paralysis experiences, is unidentified and mostly just a presence. Today I woke up and noticed the sleep paralysis started so I tried to force my eyes open, and when I opened I saw that I was the demon, and I was able to fight out of it and move but the demon was still there. Now I’m physically fighting with myself. Has anyone else ever seen themselves as the demon before or can explain wtf just happened"
331,"This isn't really sleep paralysis, but idk where else to post this",Sleepparalysis,2,"Its only happened two or three times, but it still scares the crap out of me when it does. I wake up usually in the middle of the night around 3 or 4, and I get up to use the bathroom, but everything feels off, as if i'm dreaming. The weird thing is everything looks normal, but i can't control my thoughts and it feels like someone else is in my head, like i'm fighting my own thoughts or someone else's. At first i thought i must be dreaming, so when it happened again i called my girlfriend and followed up with her the next day and she confirmed that i had called and told her what was happening. If anyone has an idea of what this is or has had it please leave a comment. Also, if anyone knows of any subreddits that would better fit this post then please let me know!"
332,Double sleep paralysis/,Sleepparalysis,0,"Hey I just recently woke up from what I thought 2 sleep paralysis in one, I’ve had sleep paralysis around 4 times before but this was the worst one. I woke up not being able to move so gave in and waited but due to my sinus problems I had congestion and it was hard to breathe in the position I was in then my head started nodding off so I assumed it was over which it was but then I fell asleep again since I was so tired then fell into another sleep paralysis and although I didn’t have hallucinations I was terrified considering the circumstances. I know it may seem stupid to say but was it a seizure or just a really vivid sleep paralysis?"
333,Just a weird experience,Sleepparalysis,0,"I just had another sleeping paralysis, and after 30 minutes i still feel shaken. Each time, its almost the same, i try to wake up and i usually feel like waking up to another dream and so on.... It may take 5 fake dreams for me, but this time i heard my phone ringing, i tried answering it (still wasnt aware it was a SP). Then i couldnt move, but i had this feel it was a very impornant call, so i felt the need to wake up and answer it, so i panicked. I still feel this pain in my chest from it.
Also each time i experience SP i am trying to tell my boyfriend to wake me up, i feel im shouting and screaming for help but nothing happens and that is the worst feel during this."
334,Have you woke up with red marks on you?,Sleepparalysis,16,Many times after a SP episode I wake up with red scratches and marks. The marks were more frequent in when I was a teenager (I’m 43 now). There would be a lot of half circles all over my stomach. Very weird. Anyone else? What could it be?
335,Curiosity,Sleepparalysis,2,What would happen if i get a sleep paralysis and someone awake is near me? I’m curious
336,Sleep paralysis eyes open?,Sleepparalysis,1,Hey so I did salvia and the day after sleeping felt really weird I believe I had sleep paralysis but I could open my eyes and everything looked trippy and weird I didn’t see any demons or any shit but I was kinda able to move my body but I felt my body waking up so I didn’t move and went back to bed is this sleep paralysis? I was also thinking the weirdest shit lol
337,Medical anthropology of sleep paralysis (UK),Sleepparalysis,4,"I am a medical anthropology student at SOAS University of London and I'm currently doing a joint study comparing sleep paralysis among the UK and Russian populations.

My co-author is a Russian psychiatrist who has done research on SP in the past and takes a compassionate approach to this subject. I am now looking for UK-based sleep paralysis sufferers to complete my questionnaire, and hope that the findings can reveal information that will help sleep paralysis sufferers. 

After experiencing sleep paralysis, I conducted another study in the final year of my undergrad degree, on how SP was shared with others, and how the stigma around SP can affect doctor-patient relationships (which I hope to have published later this year). I was really touched by how frequent or distressing SP can affect people, and I think that medical professionals must learn more and do more to help people. 

The questionnaire only takes 4-5 minutes to complete:

338,Reverse sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,19,"I keep having (maybe once a month) this kind of reverse sleep paralysis and I’ve been trying to find a name for it, so I would be really thankful if someone here could help. It usually happens in the morning and I usually hear some voice that ”wakes me up” only that I don’t wake up. I can move my whole body except I can’t open my eyes. I’ve tried literally opening my eyes with my fingers but it just doesn’t work. I’ve tried screaming and scratching myself but nothing I do wakes me up. My body feels completely normal and one morning when this happened I tried to reach my phone and actually could feel it in my hand. And when I eventually do wake up it seems like I haven’t moved at all. So in the ”dream” I can feel myself moving and I’m completely aware of my surroundings but in reality I’m not moving.

So is this just a bad dream or what? In normal dreams I can still wake myself up by blinking or something but in these cases my eyes just feel so heavy that nothing opens them. Usually I’ve been quite calm but for some reason I panicked today when this happened and now I want some answers.

Also sorry if this doesn’t belong here, I just don’t know where else I could find some answers."
339,Mystery man opened the door,Sleepparalysis,1,"So I had recently read a thread on AskReddit about the scariest thing that’s ever happened to someone when home alone. Someone wrote a post about how their dog woke them up barking at the door and when the looked out the peephole, there was some lunatic outside the door.

Well last night this exact scenario happened, my dog woke me up in the wee hours snarling and barking at the door in the meanest voice he could muster (he’s a 7 lb chihuahua). My mind immediately went to the reddit post and I was too scared to look outside. I beckoned pup back to the bedroom, shut the door, and tried to get back to sleep convincing myself it was just a critter or something.

I guess my fear wound it’s way into my sleep because I awoke shortly after, paralyzed in my bed, but could see that my bedroom door had opened and there was a man at the bottom of my bed. The man inched his way closer and eventually laid down beside me. I was trying to hard to scream and only producing these pitiful grunts. Eventually I reminded myself that “it’s ok, this is just SP.” Ive seen people abbreviate sleep paralysis and I guess it stuck. Anyway, I laughed to myself for referring to it as SP and shortly after I woke up, the bedroom door was still shut, and pup was fast asleep curled up next to me under the covers. 

Strange night."
340,I think I just experienced sleep paralysis for the first time ever.,Sleepparalysis,4,"I've always thought that sleep paralysis was a myth and even if not I thought it was something that happened in the middle of a very deep sleep.
Today I woke up when someone called me and I had to explain something to them and then I tried to go back to sleep and I couldn't. So I was just scrolling through Reddit and I was slowly starting to go to sleep. And then suddenly I dreamt that 2 of my friends came inside and started talking. But I was still lucid enough to realise that I must be dreaming. Then one of my friends got onto my bed and lay there. And I could feel her behind me on the bed. Then suddenly I needed to open my eyes and it wouldn't open. And with a huge amount of effort I managed to open my eyes. But I could still hear her lying there in the bed beside me. I could even feel the pressure on my leg through the blankets. 

I wanted to check if she was actually there but I couldn't move at all. I kept trying and nothing was working. So I closed my eyes and then opened them again. It still wouldn't move. This lasted for about 15-20 seconds and then after a while my body started working and I immediately turned around to check if my friend was there and she wasn't. 

Then I tried to get back to sleep cuz I was still very sleepy. And the within a minute I could hear really loud music being played right next to me and I could also hear someone move at the head of the bed. And then it felt like they were looming directly on top of me. Again it was really hard to open my eyes. And even when I did the music was still playing. It took me more than 10 seconds this time to move my body and turn around to look and as soon as I looked there was nothing there. It was a very strange experience and frankly kinda terrifying."
341,Genuine question for anyone thats experienced sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,62,"Ive read you really only experience sleep paralysis while laying on your back. Ive also read you only experience it while alone. Has anyone ever experienced sleep paralysis while not on their back or with other people in the room? Curious on how accurate this is, seems very accurate for me at least. Feel free to share any experiences. 

Edit, I do remember a few times where it's happened and I wasnt on my back, I just get a strange feeling of an evil presence in the room. Its prolly never happened to me with someone else in the room because there rarely are other ppl near me when I sleep. I'd also like to clarify, have any of you seen entities with other ppl in the room?

Another edit: Thanks for all the responses, love all the info. Very interesting"
342,Can you keep getting sleep Paralysis over and over everytime you try to sleep. could it be something else,Sleepparalysis,3,Everytime ive layed down and closed my eyes like a minute or less in to doing so i feel paralyzed and like i cant breath for like 10 seconds but i can still make noises and im having no hallucinations and i also dont feel like im not getting anywhere close to falling asleep but its happend like 6 times tonight and i just gave up on trying to sleep
343,sleep paralysis but no scary stuff,Sleepparalysis,9,"hi! i keep on getting sleep paralysis but its different than what others perceive it to be. my sleep paralysis does not have a monster or a demon. no scary stuff. its just that i couldnt move, scream or whatever and i just get stuck there for a good 2-5 minutes until i snap out of it. its weird bcas i thought there would be scary stuff on it but mine never had one. is it still called sleep paralysis and am i the only one who experiences it?"
344,My only experience with SP (I think),Sleepparalysis,0,"     It was a fall night in 2014. My family of 6 all lived in a small 3 bedroom apartment by our local college. I am a gamer sadly so my hours of gaming would conflict with my family so I couldn’t really play on my own until around 12pm. Advanced Warfare just came out and I stayed up grinding for weapon variants. My eyes grew heavy and ears became null as I stayed up the day prior so I had zero to no sleep in 2 days. 

     I called it around 3 and felt sooo tired. But I kept looking to my left in the pitch black kitchen/dining room as I swore I kept hearing my siblings call for me and run around in the room. But they should (and were) asleep. I was out in the living room and didn’t feel like I could make it to my room I was so tired. I fell asleep on the couch, cautiously watching the dark abyss of the kitchen.

I woke up at an unknown hour but it was still pitch black. My body was feverish and sweaty and I couldn’t move without wanting to pass out or throw up. When I did it felt like pins and needles but I could still move. I slowly made my way off the couch I was sleeping on and stood up and looked at the abyss of the kitchen. I heard multiple scratches like a dog walking on tiled floors as the floor was laminated but we had no pets to do so. It was slow and drawn out and I was frozen, standing in place as these scratches drew closer. I also saw a bunch of shadow figures crawling swiftly along my kitchen floor but barely seeing them. They looked hunched and darker than black. I was filled with such dread and fear in those moments that I passed out on the floor in front of the kitchen. 

I woke up back on the couch early morning (around 7:30 am) before my family would ever wake up. Only remnants of pain in my body was a light headache otherwise I could move fine..

How did I get back on the couch.. was it all a dream? why were there so many figures? How did I not wake up sick at 10am? 

I believe it was just sleep withdrawal but it also physically affected me and my movements like a flu. To this day it’s my only real scary experience other than doors opening and slamming by themselves. But I haven’t had anything happen in the past 4 years."
345,Someone knocking on windows?,Sleepparalysis,4,"This is my first post on this subreddit, and I'm german, sorry for any mistakes.  
Recently something started knocking on my windows at night, first time it was just one small knock, and when I activated my light, I heard something running away (I have gravel around my windows and I can hear the compression bc of this). The second time it became louder and faster, there were multiple kockings, once I activated my lights, it stopped and I heard running. this night I hard it again, but on 2 of my windows, and 2people ran away, since I often have SP. I would like to have some help on this. (btw my bedroom is in the basement)"
346,Weird ladies laughing,Sleepparalysis,4,"I had SP again for the millionth time, and it was so weird. I was lying on my side and realized I couldn’t move. I heard a woman laughing. It wasn’t a scary laugh at all. It was a normal laugh as if she was talking to a friend. Then I heard a second woman voice. She joined in, but then the laugh changed. They both made a sound like ooooooooo-waaaaaaaaa-owwwwwww. It was the weirdest thing. And if that wasn’t already weird, the first woman started lightly tickling me in my stomach. When I stopped SP’ing, I still felt it until it faded away. I never open my eyes during SP because I’m scared of what I might see, so my eyes were closed the entire time. Just thought I’d share my experience. :)"
347,My SP demon,Sleepparalysis,3,"My sleep paralysis demon is horrible, his hands are wrapped around my neck, and he's choking me, and I can't breathe or move obviously. It has long claws. like fingers and a weird shaped head."
348,Last Nights Experience,Sleepparalysis,0,"Last night I was watching Cold Case File before bed. Eventually I fell asleep. When I woke up I could still hear the show playing but I wasn't all there. I was unable to move, but I could still understand the dialogue from the show, being that it was a show about crime/murder, being in that state made me fear that something bad was going to happen to me. I remember wriggling out of this constricting feeling and I was fully in control again."
349,This is a question for those with chronic sleep paralysis im curious does doing benzos or weed stop you from having it or any other drugs help?,Sleepparalysis,19,0
350,I can’t stop experiencing sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,34,"For the past month i’ve experienced paralysis while waking up in the morning or taking a nap during the day. It’s throwing me off because I’ve experienced this a just few times when I was a child but now i’m 21 and just moved into a new place and almost every other time i go to sleep my eyes open and my body is completely asleep, I can hear voices talking outside my room and see shadows of people walking around my room, sometimes they’re familiar faces and other times they look like dementors from harry potter. I’ve tried doing research and people say it is a rare occurrence so it’s starting to freak me out how often I have been experiencing this phenomenon. It scares me more because it only happens to me when my boyfriend isn’t home so I start to think maybe this is real? Even when I do wake up i genuinely question if I am still dreaming or actually awake. To give a rough estimate I’d say i’ve experienced this at least 7 times in just the past 30 days. Anyone have any help on how to stay calm when I do go through this or the causes of it? Or i don’t know how to make it stop?"
351,So I’ve experienced sleep paralysis twice that I can recall...,Sleepparalysis,0,"The first time I thought it was just a nightmare until I couldn’t wake up. I dreamed that my house was catching on fire and I couldn’t move. I kept trying to yell for my family but I couldn’t get a sound out. I physically felt like I was suffocating on smoke. When I came out of it I was panting and panicking. 

The second time was right around the time “The Nun” was being heavily advertised on apps like Snapchat. I fell asleep watching a trailer for it and “woke up” to the demon from it running its nails down my actual spine (like the bone itself and not my skin) and whispering in my ear. I couldn’t move and kept trying to scream but again, nothing came out. When I actually woke up in the morning I was laying in the same position as I was during the paralysis."
352,Confronting The Sleep Paralysis Demon,Sleepparalysis,7,"I have sleep paralysis episodes 2 times a year, but I usually only see black and have to wait patiently to snap myself out of it. However on the rare occasion, I get sleep paralysis with a demon involved. When I was young, back at my old home, in my old bedroom, I was just stuck with it either hovering over me or watching me from the corner of my room. I was always terrified. This figure was a black shadow, I could never really get a clear picture of it, it was slender, skinny and tall. It rarely ever physically harmed me but like most of you know, you can feel other entities intent in dreams and its intent was always to cause harm. Even as a child, although I was scared of it I was always fairly brave, and maybe that's why it never tried anything with more malice. Sometimes it would slip back into the closet, as if that's where it originated. 

In my late teens and early 20's I started being able to lucid dream when I wanted and control my dream state. The black figure didn't return and I went 7 years since without an episode with a demon.  Last night that changed. I was having a dream of conflict. Conflict with my brother and sister. The conflict with my brother escalated and I began to strangle him in my dreams. As I got closer to killing my brother, my hands around his neck, a very simple logic came into my mind...i thought to myself out loud ""I don't want to kill my brother"". In an instant, after that thought, I was suddenly and intensely kicked from my dream into sleep paralysis state in my current bedroom where I live right now. I couldn't move and it was black, like my normal sleep paralysis. But I felt a different sense, like something was inside of me. So I conscientiously entered my dream state with lucid thought. 

As I did, there I was back in my childhood bedroom, laying on my bed with a demon hovering over me. It was a different demon, which looked different from the one I saw in my childhood. I could see it crystal clear. It was 4.5 - 5 ft tall, lanky body, arms and legs were longer in proportion to a regular humans body and the torso was shorter, it had red skin glistening with moisture and yellow goat eyes, its teeth looked like rats teeth, only 2 on the top of the mouth and 2 on the bottom. It stared into my eyes. 

I plunged myself back into a lucid dream because I was ready to confront this entity. I slowly lifted myself off the bed and came face-to-face with this demon, it did not back down. I stood up out of the bed and hovered over the demon with my teeth bared and I let out a wild, deep, unsettling shout from the deepest part of my soul. It started to slowly move back as I stepped forward driving it slowly toward the closet. Halfway to the closet the demon stopped as if to say, ""I will go no further"".  It then let out its own screech. The sound had a mixture of high and low pitches along with something like chattering in the background. This had no effect on me, my confidence to confront and repel this demon was stonewall strong and unwavering. I never actually touched the demon, but forced it back with just my mental intent to banish it out of the realm of my conscience mind. It was a slow process but by the end I had so much control of my single minded determination, that it backed into the closet and dissipated. 

I don't know if I pushed it out forever or why it's even here. But I woke up this morning feeling refreshed and energized. Maybe now that I am older and I have some mastery over my conscience dream-state mind with lucid dreaming, I will be able to continue to keep it at bay. Maybe it will never come back. Who knows...

Let me know if anyone has thoughts. I'd love to know what you think or share experiences."
353,I don’t know,Sleepparalysis,3,"I think in 5th grade was the first time I had some sort of version of sleep paralysis. The night before it happened I got sick but the next day I still went to school thats because there was a event that I wanted to take part in, and it was going to be the last event that I was going to have in that school. During the event I started  to feel dizzy and passed out. My dad took me to the hospital. When I was passed out I could hear everything but could not move nor open my eyes. I remember the conversation that my dad had with the paramedics. The doctor asked if I had any medicine in the last 24 hours. I still couldn’t move and couldn’t open my eyes everything was black. Another thing I remember my dad telling me to not cry so I guess I was crying when I was passed out. Then I was able to open my eyes again. Went home a few hours afterwards 
I never told this to anyone because I have never been able to make sense of it and still don’t.

I don’t know if it was sleep paralysis or something else but what makes me think it is more sleep paralysis is because after that incident I have had other episodes."
354,I think I went through sleep paralysis and some demon type of shit was involved,Sleepparalysis,6,"Last night I experienced the most traumatising thing to have ever happened to me and I'm not sure if what happened means something or it was just a nightmare or I don't even know!

So I woke up from a dream at about 4:30am but I wasn't physically awake because I couldn't move or talk. When I woke up it was like something was putting all their weight onto my chest causing it to be very hard to breathe. I was gasping for air for idk how long and then it all just stopped and next minute I opened my eyes and it was like I was in third person view ( almost like my spirit just came out of my fu\*king body. )  and was looking down at me sleeping. And then I saw in the corner of my eye this creepy demon looking thing just standing at my door - and every time I would try and wake up this thing kept moving closer and closer until he was resting right at my head and was like whispering somthing into my ear. I was still in third person so I was still looking down on this. I was just laying there so still and then I lock eyes with this thing and he just disappears. And then I woke up. 

&#x200B;

I am still freaking out as I can't get this image out of my head! Do you reckon it was just a nightmare or what. ( I don't think it was a dream as I could physically feel the pain of me running out of oxygen.) Someone help ahah I don't know if this is a sign and if I should be concerned for my safety."
355,Hat Man?,Sleepparalysis,2,"I’ve only ever seen him once in sleep paralysis and it was the first episode I can remember having back in 2012. For me it was a man in a white suit and white hat standing at the end of the hallway. Couldn’t make out his features because it was too dark, just the suit. I know other people talk about hat man too in this thread. Is this like some sort of gatekeeper to the sp world? lmao."
356,If you have spiritualistic items...,Sleepparalysis,1,"I thought I'd share my experience with paralysis. Until December 2019 I was having paralysis probably three/four nights a week. The usual paralysis, frozen but aware - seeing ""things"" in different places of my room. Around the same time, my best friend had a reading from a medium. He stated that someone close to her had something attached to it, and both their ""attachment"" and hers would act up when the person was over. 

Eventually we connected the dots, and after I would be at her place lights would turn on throughout the night, the keyboard would type by itself - once they even woke up and the front door was wide open. After all of this, you could say I was spooked (I thoroughly believe paralysis is connected to this kind of thing). 

Eventually after a couple of breakdowns, I realized that I needed to cleanse myself of some things. I had tarot cards on my shelf, and decided to get rid of them. I gave them to my boyfriend and he gave them to a friend who was interested. I also got rid of a Satanic Bible I had on the same shelf. 

Since December I have had paralysis twice. It may be a subconscious thing, or it may be real. From my experience, if you suffer from paralysis often and have tarrot cards, a oujia board, or any other seance items, I recommend removing them from your home and seeing if  the constant paralysis stops. 

I'd love to hear if this works for any of you!"
357,I heard hundreds of people chanting chip,Sleepparalysis,2,"I was having an extremely vivid dream, when all of a sudden I felt as though I was spiraling down. And I heard this one voice, specifically a kid I knew from middle school, and he only said chip. And then I thought haha, chip. But then he started saying it louder and more aggressively, and I heard more and more people. It was like a shouting in my ear, and I found that I couldn’t move, so I knew what was happening and knew I just had to wake my body up. Just all of the people yelling chip was weird, and pretty scary."
358,Kept hearing my mom enter my room while laughing,Sleepparalysis,3,"I had a weird sleep paralysis where my eyes were closed but I could feel and hear everything else and I knew I was not fully conscious but all my senses were awake.

I heard my mom enter my room laughing and leave multiple times and I knew it wasn't her. Then I genuinely felt her walk around my bed, throw the blanket off my body, giggle in a high-pitched tone and throw the blanket back and leave.

I also keep feeling people jump onto my bed and rock it back and forth when I'm in sleep paralysis."
359,Why do I hallucinate for a split second every time I wake up?,Sleepparalysis,2,"Sorry if this isn't the right sub for this, I wasn't sure where to post. For a few days now I have been seeing things for a split second after I wake up. It doesn't last very long but it is still very startling. Usually it's just weird shadows, but they've been getting worse, yesterday I saw a furby (??? lmao) and today I saw a weird scarecrow-like monster thing hovering over me. Both of these only lasted for a split second but they still really scared me. 

Is this just really short sleep paralysis? I'm very confused as to what this is, I can't really find anything about it on the internet. I don't have a family history of sleep paralysis and have never had any problems with hallucinating before this. Thank you for any help!"
360,"I just discovered I've had recurrent sleep paralysis, and now I'm scared",Sleepparalysis,0,"Right around the time I was in the middle of my college education, I started to have these very strange dreams. Very often, about once or twice per week, I would ""wake up"" and just lay there, aware of my surroundings but unable to control anything.

The first time it happened, it felt like I was struggling for my life. I was facing down and on my side, and I was afraid of not being able to move my body ever again; what if I was in a comma? Is this what dying is like?

I ""powered through"" and woke up, only to immediately fall down again, as if I was blacking out and returning to that horrible limbo. After hours, I could finally stay awake. I ran out of the room and took a cold shower, I never wanted that to happen again. But it did.

You could say it got better. I learned to stay calm when it happened, and learned to focus my willpower, so to speak, and force myself awake, something that I've learned to do when dreaming in general, whether lucid or nightmares.

Now, after years, recent reading has made me believe I was suffering from, well, sleep paralysis. My only other experience with it was vague memory I had from when I was 7 years old, where looking back it happened and I saw a creature on top of me, but I never related these events because I never saw a creature again, not even during all of these episodes.

But now I'm scared shitless, because I've read the ""demons"" come from suggestions within the mind, and now that I'm aware of it I'm afraid they'll start appearing, which makes me anxious because I'm scared of being anxious of being scared. See where I'm going?

TL;DR: Just realized I've been having paralysis, demons never showed up, I'm afraid they will now that I know they should"
361,A positive sleep,Sleepparalysis,0,So I usually wake up and make my boyfriend breakfast before he goes to work and I go back to sleep after he leaves. He usually leaves by 6:40am. I have been working remotely so I sleep until I have work at 8am. I went to sleep around 6:45am. I started having layers of dreams. The first dream was a house party. Woke up at a random concert in LasVegas. Then woke up at six flags. So eventually my mind is awake and I am watching myself physically sleeping. I tried to move my body but for about ten seconds I couldn’t move. Nothing hurt. I wasn’t scared but I just thought I would share because I have never experienced anything like this. When I finally woke up I felt well rested and super interested in what happened to me.
362,My sleep paralysis experiences,Sleepparalysis,3,"I have experienced sleep paralysis twice in my life.

The first time it happened, I was about 9 or so and sleeping in between my parents. I must’ve woken up in the middle of the night and quickly went back to sleep. I soon heard an evil laugh that I can only remember myself thinking sounded like a witch. I was freaking out because I couldn’t speak or move, and I remember trying so hard to scream. I woke up petrified. After that night, I never had this type of experience again.

Fast forward many years, I am now 20 and am a very spiritual/religious person. I’ve read a bit about astral projection and think it’s very intriguing. Recently, I woke up briefly in the morning (about 6 or so), and I recalled something I read on a reddit thread about having an easier time astral projecting right after waking up from a deep sleep. I closed my eyes and essentially just relaxed my entire body. Almost instantly I began to hear multiple people whispering. Their whispers were muffled, and I couldn’t interpret anything that was said. I got scared and instantly tried to wake myself back up. Again, I couldn’t move (& although I didn’t attempt to speak, I don’t think I could’ve if I tried). Luckily, I quickly woke myself up.

Thankfully, the second time around was not nearly as scary, and I didn’t have as bad of an experience. I honestly think I’m more intrigued about the whole thing, rather than scared. Overall, I’m posting this here to simply share my experiences and for others to share their thoughts, experiences, and knowledge on sleep paralysis, astral projection, their potential relation, etc!"
363,my cat saved me from the sp demon,Sleepparalysis,13,"ive had a few episodes of sleep paralysis, all involving this one very skinny tall ‘demon’. i usually have some hallucinations, people i know giggling and running around my room that will then transform into the demon that will creep around my bed and come stand next to me. ive never seen him above his legs. he usually just leans over me, standing there, freaking me the hell out. 
one night i experienced it again, the demon standing a bit further away from me except this time they were reaching out for me, slowly, slowly coming closer with his long boney hands. my cat, who sleeps with me, bit my leg REALLY hard. i ended up screaming and snapping out of it. the demon was gone and my cat was sleeping peacefully next to my legs. since then i havent had a single sp episode. i think he saved me that night."
364,Recently I have been closing my eyes and rolling them up to break out of sleep paralysis and begin lucid dreaming or out of body experience.,Sleepparalysis,0,"I have only done this twice so far but both times it has worked.

When I roll my eyes up I start seeing colours colours, like when you run your eyes, every time I have done this the sleep paralysis stopped."
365,Parálisis de sueño 👏😞,Sleepparalysis,3,"La fina línea entre lo real y las alucinaciones es inquietante , suelo ver personas pegadas en el techo cuando duermo boca arriba , no me asusta verlas de lejos pero hace poco me desperté y había un chico durmiendo en mi cama un  de cabello castaño claro y los ojos Completamente Negros  me asuste mucho y lo peor es que no podía moverme .. alguien más sufrió de este tipo de alucinaciones en una parálisis ? AYuda"
366,Floating skull,Sleepparalysis,0,So I opened my eyes it was around sundown because I saw an orange sky and the living room light poured into the dark bedroom through the hall and I remember trying to get up but I couldn’t. And I look up towards the door and I see this hideous face like a skull slowly creep up it was abnormally big and I began to cry and close my eyes as I felt it get closer and when it was up in my face I opened my eyes and tried to scream and it screamed instead and the stench was horrible as it taunted me dancing around my body until I closed my eyes for the last time and woke up finding a pleasant surprise I had just soiled the floor. (All of my sleep paralysis experiences Have been when I sleep on the floor wether I’m too tired to get up or I just don’t feel like going to bed).
367,I felt deaths cold embrace,Sleepparalysis,0,"I would like to start off by saying this i my first time expirenceing something like this however I used to have and so.etime still do expirence night terrors and have since I was about 10. 

So I woke up not long ago at the time of wrighting this so it's still fresh, I woke up because I felt someone. Had come behind me and had wrapped there arm around me. At first I thought it was my girlfriend however due to her working at a hospital we haven't been able to see each other in a while and haven't been over each other's since the lockdown, I knew this couldn't be the case so I tried to open my eyes and look , they felt heavy but I managed to do so my room was dark with only the light from the sky leaking into my bedroom which was minimal at best as it is currently 3.45am at the time of writing. Then I thought maybe it was my little sister. She sees me as her father figure  and would sometimes come to my room when she had nightmares when she was between 1 and 4  however I was curious who it actually was I tried reaching behind me and I felt an arm however my eyes started to come adjust to the low light levels and I could then see that my arm was in front of me. I begung to realise whatever was behind me actually felt as cold as ice this was really unsettling. It felt as if death was embracing me from behind I couldn't move my whole body felt heavy. I thought as I've this was the end for me. I was tired still and I felt my eyes getting heavy again trying to close but in my head I thought if I do close them I won't wake up again. This struggle felt like it lasted for hours however in reality it probably only lasted a few minutes at best. 

I was finally able to move I had been trying to the whole time I turned over and saw no one. My first reaction was to message my gf I then began to write it out to post.

 I haven't felt this scared since I was a kid. I don't think I will go back to sleep tonight"
368,"first ever experience, have questions",Sleepparalysis,2,"Today I had my first experience with what I believe to have been Sleep Paralysis, not 100% certain and am just hoping if I could get some details cleared out.

Essentially I was having a dream where I was sitting in an office building where the “President of Microsoft” was sitting across from me and offered me a job as the CEO of Microsoft. (very realistic i know, and i also think it’s worth nothing that i was well aware at this point that I was dreaming, I remember thinking it was funny that my salary was only going to be $17,000 a month.) Anyways after signing the paperwork and everything, the president disappeared and told me to do some accounting. This is when it happened, as soon as I sat down and picked up the pen I felt my shoulder and neck area being grabbed, I was lifted up and across from the mirror in front of me I saw a shadowy figure, probably 10 feet tall essentially crushing me, just holding me up and letting me watch my reflection. At this point the dream faded to static and i was back to reality where I was eyes open laying in bed and unable to move. Struggling with the immense pain and panic, I eventually hallucinated that I got up from bed and went to go call an ambulance, then a second later in a blink i was back in bed struggling with the paralysis again. I don’t really know what happened but eventually just like that I was able to move again and it was almost like the whole thing never happened.

Something I would like the note is that I also have some minor anxiety and have also experienced panic attacks recently aswell, and each of those things are new developments in my life. 

A few questions I have:

1. Does my description above represent what would be considered Sleep paralysis? A big detail about it is that not the whole thing took place in my room I was sleeping in, and just sort of felt like a nightmare carrying over to me being awake.

2. Is this a sign of my anxiety deteriorating? I’ve experienced a lot of new symptoms gradually and am wondering if this is just the next step of it.

3. A smaller question, but ive done a little research and i’ve found that people who’ve experienced this tend to be in sleeping conditions different than normal. For me I usually sleep on my side and at night, this happened when I slept on my back and during the day, so just curious as to if there’s any truth to that idea that different sleeping environments cause sleep paralysis.

I know this was a lot to read and wasn’t worded the best so I really do appreciate any help."
369,Just auditory?,Sleepparalysis,6,"So, I don't experience sleep paralysis especially often, but the one more intense experience I had didn't actually have too much going on visually. I felt like I was waking up in the middle of a conversation I was already having, but after it happened I couldn't possibly tell you what any of the words were. I could hear whoever I was talking to and could tell from their inflection that they were angry, but couldn't see them even when I opened my eyes. Every time my eyes shut I'd see imagery of wild facial expressions, but if I opened them again, it'd fade out the way floaters do after you rub you eyes, but the voice didn't stop until I kept my eyes open long enough to the images to fade completely.

All this is just to ask, does anyone else have sleep paralysis stories that don't really have much of a visual element?"
370,Becoming more intense?,Sleepparalysis,3,"Over the past few years, I’ve had sleep paralysis episodes. I went through a few months where it was happening often, but it stopped for a while. Last night I had a really bad one and it felt more intense than before. 

Some of the ones I’ve had before:
I dreamt that I was driving and half my body went numb, starting with my right eye and then the whole right side of my body. I woke up and couldn’t move, and my eye was swollen for a little that morning. This was an early one so I figured probably allergies. 

The other ones were typical. Woke up couldn’t move felt like someone was watching but eventually got through it. The last one before this most recent one was me waking up from an uneventful dream with a shadow standing right over me. I heard these deep guttural moaning type of sounds and it felt like someone’s hand was moving up my thigh towards my underwear but at the same time just heavy pressure on my limbs and chest. The sexuality of that one really spooked me but it stopped for a while after that. 

Last night was terrible. At first I was stuck inside a nightmare and every time I would “wake up” I’d be stuck in a new one. I finally actually woke up and felt like my whole body was being held down. There was a shadow at the window that had the shape of a large man just staring in at me and the whole time I’m trying to scream for help but nothings coming out. My dog was barking at the shadow but I still was just stuck.  When I finally was able to move the shadow stayed there for a while, but I got up off the couch and it disappeared. 

The new part of this one (besides it being hella long) is I have small bruises on my arms and legs. Nothing big, but dime-sized super random bruises scattered on just my arms and legs? Idk considering seeking a medium or therapist at this point. 

TL: sleep paralysis is back, this time I have little bruises."
371,Safe place,Sleepparalysis,2,"I've had sleep paralysis for 5ish years now, researched it, and recently made a blog to discuss different dream states (including sleep paralysis). Comment your wildest sleep paralysis experience, and if you'd like to give my blog a look :)"
372,Anyone scream during SP where it’s actually audible?,Sleepparalysis,18,"I had an episode two nights ago and I felt like I was screaming for a few minutes straight and I was calling out my partners name. I could hear him fumbling to turn on the light and then I realized he could actually HEAR me screaming. He said it was only for a few seconds, and that I never called out his name but part of my screams were actually audible? Has anyone else experienced anything like this?"
373,Sleep Paralysis,Sleepparalysis,7,"Hi, since I know what sleep paralysis is it has been one of my biggest fears so if I ever get it can anyone please share some tips with me to stay calm?"
374,Really strange experience,Sleepparalysis,0,"I’ve experienced SP since I was about 9 years old off and on, I started smoking weed about a year ago and haven’t experienced it since, until now. I’m taking a tolerance break from weed and the sleep paralysis has came back, but not as I remember it. Last night, I was sleeping on my friends sofa and started hallucinating him sitting there after he went to bed, about 10 minutes went by and a figure appeared with no features except a mouth. It pinned me down and started swaying back and fourth on top of me and then started screaming what felt like an inch from my face. All the usual SP symptoms of not being able to move, not being able to make any noise myself were all there like usual, I just find it strange that I was hallucinating my friend being there this time, which has never happened before. I usually share a room with my brother when I’ve experienced SP before so maybe it’s my brain trying to find a way to cope with this being alone? Any insight would be appreciated, thank you"
375,Worse one yet,Sleepparalysis,0,I didn’t no this was a group I didn’t even no what read it was up until a month or two ago. I been dealing with SP by myself for years and it’s only getting worse it comes and goes but wtf man I just got stuck (that’s what I call it anyway) and my girl usually wakes me but she was not around in the worse fucking dream and yelling and the hole 9 I don’t even want to go back to bed after this one. I am happy I found a group for this I’m going to check it out now for a long time no one ever new what I was dealing with shit the sleep doc didn’t believe me so I’m hoping I can find some people to relate to and hopefully you can get some useful tips and ways of dealing with this. I was so fuckkng upset my girl found me with my head down I fear sleeping alone for this reason
376,My 2nd Sleep Paralysis was actually not bad.,Sleepparalysis,0,"I was asleep in my room when suddenly my eyes popped open. I was laying on my back (not good for sleep paralysis) and I looked over and saw my mom walking into my room. This was impossible because my door was locked and had a security bar on it. She was carrying something (I don’t remember what) and she said “My gosh, this room’s a mess. Where should I put this...?” I tried to say “put what where?” But I couldn’t speak or move. She then said “I’ll just put it here.” Set the item on my dresser and headed for the closed door. I tried to move my head to follow her out the door when my eyes popped open and my head was laying on its side staring at the computer screen, my door still shut and locked, and my alarm to get up about to go off. I didn’t have a sense of panic or shortness of breath this time so a much nicer experience then my 1st. Just wanted to share, thanks for reading!"
377,I've been experiencing a series of SP for 3 years now.,Sleepparalysis,3,"I really dont know if this is some paranormal shit or what so ever. I just want to know if there are people who are experiencing the same as me.

My first episode of SP started three years ago.  I just got home from night school and decided to take a sleep already. I just changed clothes, didnt even showered just straight onto bed. I remember on that moment when I instantly closed my eyes the SP just triggered. Usual feeling when having a SP which is, you can't move. As a first timer because of that I panicked and try to move as much as I can but I failed. I also tried to scream for help but my mouth wont just open. Feeling hopeless I just took a deep breath and started to relax and accept my death.I just suddenly realized that Im not ready to die yet and I tried to open my eyes. Thankfully I become awake and back to reality again. I was not able to sleep at that night because of that. 

After that it happens like every week for three months. Same shit. The only way I was able to wake up is taking a deep breath, relaxing my body and opening my eyes. Since that is what I do when I first experienced SP. Im not taking it as a big deal because maybe Im just stress from school works. Plus its already happening everyweek that I already get used to it. But those once a week becomes thrice a week and Im already getting annoyed and  frustrated because I cant sleep properly and Im also scared already.

Because of this onslaught episodes of SP. I cannot have a proper sleep anymore and my mind couldnt handle the sleepiness that I feel, so I my eyes just automatically closed and my mind suddenly react that I might have an SP again if I tried to sleep. Then, the SP triggered. It was like, I tried to woke up during the middle of going to sleep and it triggered. So I woke up and realized what just happened that maybe it is the reason why it triggers. I tried to do it at that same night and yes its truly the reason why the SP is triggered. So from that time I dont sleep right away. I close my eyes and relaxing my body and let myself fall asleep like automatically. 

The SP stopped like 2 months. And then another episode happened. It was during the middle my sleep. So I tried to use my old reliable method to wake up but this time its not working. I did it like 3-5 times still not working. I starting to panic already. So much panic that I was able to move forcefully. And when I say forcefully. Every move that I make it feels like my soul is getting torn apart from my body. It is so painful I cant even explain it. Its so painful that I can able to scream during sleep paralysis. During that phenomenon that is happening to me I just snapped and woke up. Feeling very exhausted and hurting my throat. Again I was not able to after that.

After a few days I tried the Waking up during the start of the sleep method which still works and I can still wake up using the ol reliable relaxing method that I always do. After a weeks it happened again during mid sleep. Waking up traumatized and exhausted again. Starting that time the SP episodes are happening like 3 times a week, a full week. It happens almost everytime that I got really used to it. Sometimes I can wake up using that relaxation method and sometimes not. But there is a time that I endured the pain of that soul ripping feeling during my SP. After that I was able to sit and I felt like my soul is out of my body. But I didnt opened my eyes because Im still scared and I just lay down right away again to wake up.

Up to now, Im still experiencing some random unexpected SP. Like maybe 100+ of them. Also, I was now able to sit up turn around and look at my own body lying down. Like I was astral projecting or something like that but I still need to take that soul ripping experience before going to that astral projection thingy.

So if there are some people out there that has the almost same experience like me. Please do share your stories. It will be very much appreciated to know that Im not the only one experiencing these kind of things.

P.S. Sorry if the my story is kinda messy. I did my best on explaining it as much as I can do. Thank you and no hate please."
378,[ENG] How I become friend with the Monster of my sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,11,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

For people who remember me, I finally made the english version of my Website !

&#x200B;

For the other or as a reminder, like  a lot of people, I do sleep paralysis and a monster assaulted me in the  past. One time, he totally took the appearance of the Mind Flayer from  Stranger Things.

I  create a website to talk about how I discover that the monster, who was  assaulted me, is my  unconscious and how I become friend with him.

Today, during sleep paralysis or lucid dream, I can sometime talk to the Mind Flayer, like I can talk a real person.

I  discover that during those paralysis, the Mind Flayer was sending me  some messages to help me: sometime it was just a hug, one time he  punished me because I was mistreating my body, some to take some news  from me... I don't talk about demon, spirit, djin or call it as you  want. I talk about our unconscious. About us finally.

When  I discover all of this, I try to search testimonials about people who  can do like me. But I didn't find... Thereby, I decided to create a  website to find people like me and to help people with there sleep  paralysis. I don't try to make people talk to there unconscious like I do. I just want to help them to understand the messages of there unconscious.

Some  people who make a depression, can do sleep paralysis bound to this.  Sometimes, the psychologists analyze the sleep paralysis dreams to help  people.

With my experience with the Mind Flayer, I think if people can understand the messages of there unconscious, they can go ahead !

Personally, since I discover that the Mind Flayer is my unconscious, I never feel better before !

I'm happy, after all the work I do, to give you the english version. There's a french version too. :)

&#x200B;

 Here the link of my website. I gain no money and there's no ads. It's create to help people. Feel free to share the Website and like the Facebook page to follow the news ;)

&#x200B;

Nowadays, I only find one person who  can speak with his unconscious. One time, he dances with him, like I did  with the Mind Flayer too. Maybe it's the way to accept his presence ! And maybe it will be your turn one day ! :)

Have a nice day !

379,Paranormal Experience or Sleep Paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,3,"I'd like to preface this by saying I am not one to ever really experience paranormal activity. The closest thing to a paranormal experience I've had is hearing soft creaks in my childhood home.

I (f/25) am currently staying with my boyfriend in a small one-bedroom apartment. This morning around 7am, after my boyfriend left for work and I was alone in bed, some strange things happened. I was half-asleep but conscious and felt an undeniable presence in the bedroom. I subsequently felt pressure on the bed on my left side (I was sleeping on my side facing right) as if someone or something large had sat down on the bed right up next to me. I was scared and felt paralyzed knowing that I was alone and scared to look over to see what it was. After about two minutes I looked over and saw nothing.

Eventually I went back to sleep for a bit longer and again was awakened, though admittedly somewhat half-asleep. This time I heard the bathroom water running and the bathroom cabinet opening, as if my boyfriend had come back and was in the bathroom (he was not). Again I felt paralyzed by fear but this time it was worse. I felt my whole body freeze intensely and I was unable to move at all (could this be sleep paralysis?). When I opened my eyes and looked over the water and all noises stopped. After this I was so scared that I moved to the couch to sleep.

Though both instances scared me, I did not necessarily feel threatened or harmed. I should add that I was alone this whole time and I don't think this would have happened if I wasn't.

Not sure exactly what this was, or if it had anything to do with insomnia or sleep paralysis (neither of which I have had issues with in the past). I have never experienced anything like this before.

Any insight is tremendously appreciated."
380,Why does sleep paralysis cause anxiety? (As well as a warning about naps.),Sleepparalysis,2,"Now, I get what you're thinking, ""Sleep paralysis is caused by anxiety."" That is true, but it is also true that Sleep Paralysis is called by this thing called a... ""nap."" Yes, a thing you decided to do when your brain wants some more of that precious thing we call ""sleep."" All of my SP experiences are triggered by naps, never, was a time it was caused by sleep. So, moral of the story: Don't take naps (But do if you really need it.)

Every SP experience I had wasn't scary, only annoying. I have to sit through buzzing sounds in my ear while my body feels like it is having the most uncomfortable massage. Oh, and if I try to move, the massaging gets harder. So it wasn't really scary, but here is a question... Why does SP cause anxiety?

I recently had a SP experience, it happened yesterday when I drifted off to sleep due to boring Terraria (a game) footage. Now, at certain times, I would be struck with sudden anxiety/paranoia. It is totally gonna ruin me going downstairs to the kitchen in complete darkness to fill up my water bottle. I can't do that anymore, Sleep Paralysis just makes me a total wimp!

TL;DR: I should not take naps because they cause SP, and can you tell me why SP causes me to have anxiety? Thanks!"
381,My SP experience.,Sleepparalysis,2,"Background: I am Male and I was 8 or 9 at the time.  I was terrified of FNAF. The one I hated the most and scared me was Springtrap. The fact that he is a walking corpse just terrified me.

It all started when I woke up from sleep and it was dark in my room so I assumed it was like 2 or 3. Then... I saw him. From the edge of my bed. Just staring at me. With my nightlight in place I knew it was Springtrap I could see his outline and his white soulless eyes locked onto me. Then he began to hobble toward me from the edge of my bed. That's when I realized I could not move. Then I tried to scream mom, I couldn't talk at all. As he came closer I heard muffled gurgle and static coming from him. Always never breaking eye contact. When he was halfway he stopped and then wound back and started sprinting. I've never been so scared in my life before that moment. Right as he was about to reach me I woke up so scared I got out of bed and litterly bolted to my parents room. I slept with them the rest of the night."
382,Documentary Project,Sleepparalysis,0,"I'm actively casting for a possible documentary about sleep paralysis and individuals who see the common shadow figure.  If anyone is interested in sharing your story or participating in any way - please send me a personal message with a little bit of information about yourself, where you're  based / have experienced it most and any other details you feel comfortable sharing. 

thank you!"
383,I had an SP episode last night and now I'm terrified to sleep,Sleepparalysis,1,"I've had sleep paralysis episodes a lot over the years but they were usually just temporary and I was able to force myself to snap out of it and open my eyes because I knew it wasn't real. I was usually just unable to move and could see my ceiling above. I didn't have an episode for over a year till last night. I was very drowsy and I fell asleep and suddenly I saw ghost-like dark hands holding me down and I felt as though someone was on me. It felt like my legs were being held down as well and I couldn't move at all, I could just see my television in front of me. I was able to force myself to wake up after a minute. I was terrified for a few minutes but just brushed it off and watched something for a while and then fell asleep again. This time, I had a worse episode. I was sitting up straight and saw the same hands and felt like I was being pulled or sucked into something. This time I thought it was really happening and yelled out for my mother. It went on for about 5-6 minutes. I was yelling the entire time and trying to brush the hands off of me and escape. I didn't see any creature, just felt hands either on me or pulling me. I suddenly woke up sweating profusely and realized it was a dream. It felt extremely real though which is why I've been extremely shaken up. I've never experienced an episode of this sort before and I didn't even know it could get this petrifying. I've been anxious ever since and now I'm terrified to fall asleep because I fear it will happen again and I don't want to feel all of it again. I don't believe in supernatural beings or paranormal activity but when I searched this up I read some scary cultural folklore and made myself more frantic. I don't know what to do now I can't get myself to stop thinking about it and my anxiety is peaking.

Also, I was able to move a little bit to try and break free from the hands during the second episode which has never happened before. This was still SP, right? Or could it be something else? "
384,Does anyone feel drained of energy in the morning following the SP episode?,Sleepparalysis,3,I had my 3rd episode last night (been a whole year since the last) and I’m feeling extremely lethargic. I had to drink coffee this morning (I don’t ever drink it) just to wake me up enough to work. Maybe it’s just mental exhaustion? I’m curious on how it effects others in the day following.
385,SLEEP PARALYSIS IN LUCID DREAM Very fucked up experience what from my SP’s started happening,Sleepparalysis,5,"I actually don’t want to write about this
because my last theories had shown that the less I think about it the less I get SP. 
But I’ve literally in the past searched so much about SP and never found information I wanted. Now, I found this page..exactly what I was searching

July 2017
This time, I had never heard of sleep paralysis. I had never had any different sleep experiences than a normal dream. 

So just one day
I was staying at my grandmas where I always watch TV until midnight. About 3-4 at night I thought I’ll fall asleep now. :) My horrificest experience was about to start. I would describe it as a sleep paralysis in a lucid dream with hallucinations, voices and a total nightmare. Fell asleep at grandmas, in a “dream” I was at my home in my bed, firstly started flying to my living room from a hole in a wall where irl was no hole.., that was like a cool part from that.. what (idk how) turned into a very scary nightmare where I was again in my bed, lights were off now, I laid down and couldn’t move. I was alone. In my head was only one thought/hope- is my door locked. Seconds later I heard knocks at my door. I couldn’t move. Next I heard that someone opened my door :))) I was in my bedroom it was dark and a guy with a knife got in my house and started running towards me. I was just scared to death, wanting to run away, scream, call help, but I was totally paralyzed.😫Couldn’t move, thought I’m going to die he is going to stab me with his knife and kill me. 
To that exact moment when he was about 10cm from me, all this just started again.. I heard a door open, saw a guy with knife running to me, when about 10cm from me disappeared or sth and the circle started again with no pause... the circle ran about 7-8 times and it was the longest and terriblest minutes of my life. 
It was finally over and I woke up at my grandmas..TERRIFIED. 

So I literally had a lucid dream where I was at my home and could fly and what turned into a nightmare where I got sleep paralysis.. all this action in my dream took place at MY home, but I actually was sleeping at my GRANDMAS home, so... what was it!?!?! sleep paralysis? or lucid dream? or a regular nightmare(totally not!)? or hm just a regular dream? heheheheeell no. 
 
Has anyone any thoughts what it was? 

Also from that I started having regular SP’s for 3-4 times a month and every SP is about 10-20 seconds long. Have had a lot of interesting experiences on those what I may be sharing with you in the future  Seeing things, hearing things and feeling things, but not enjoying these :D 
From now, 3 years later I have them pretty under control and even know when they are coming and can stop them before get them. 

But yeah, that was my experience :) I remember it like it was yesterday although it was 3 years ago 

Sorry about bad english tho, struggled a lot to write this"
386,Did I have sleep paralysis and a nightmare at the same time?,Sleepparalysis,0,"So this will sound weird but last night I think had a bad dream, that turned into sleep paralysis, that then went back to being a dream.

Basically I fell asleep and I remember dreaming about a shadowy figure standing over my bed. But it felt like I was watching it happen from above as if I was watching a video of it happening instead of experience it. I didn't feel lucid at this point.

Then my perspective returned to me laying in bed and I was facing the wall (my bed is in the corner of the room) and I could feel something trying to drag me out of bed with a lot of force. I couldn't move but I remember one of my hands gripping the side of the bed to keep me in place. I felt lucid at this point. I felt awake.

Then my perspective changed again and I was standing the middle of my room I couldn't see any shadow figure or other SP type thing. But I could sense some sort of presence in my room that I appeared to be physically fighting with and I eventually managed to push out of my room. I want lucid during this I just experienced it. Like you would in a regular dream.

Then my perspective shifted back to being in bed. I felt awake, lucid, relaxed and didn't feel as if anyone else was there and swiftly drifted back to sleep.

So was this experience just a dream? Was some sort of sleep paralysis? Or was it a mixture of both?"
387,Scared to sleep tonight because of last night's SP episode,Sleepparalysis,9,"I have always had trouble sleeping, and I almost never go a night without dreaming. Many times my dreams are very vivid, sometimes lucid. The majority of the time they are really out there, and more often than not they are unpleasant or full-on nightmares. I have had my fair share of episodes which I associate with SP. I had another one last night. Each time one happens, the best way I can explain it to my husband is that it doesn't feel at all like a dream- it feels like it's really happening. In last night's, I was startled ""awake"" by the sound of our bedroom door being opened. The sound ""woke"" my husband as well and even though our room was totally dark, I could just make out 2 figures entering the room. One of them began walking over to my side of the bed while the other remained on my husband's side, although both entities were focused on me. My husband was unable to speak but was pointing at them with a horrified look on his face. I was immediately struck with fear watching them get closer to me, and at first I could only manage to mutter ""NO, NO, NO!"" Could not move my body once I saw that they were there.Their eyes seemed to reflect a tiny amount of light from somewhere and although it was much too dark to make out any features, they did appear human-like (but definitely malicious, demon-like.) The more I muttered ""NO"" they began basically crawling on top of me. That's when I used every bit of courage I could muster to start reciting The Lord's Prayer. Even though the words came out weak and slow, with each new word the entities began screeching loudly and became frantic in trying to stop me. Once I reached the end of the prayer and said ""Amen"" I woke up. According to my husband, I was whimpering, twitching and muttering words in my sleep, which woke him up. He began rubbing my arm and after a while I got quiet. That's about the time I remember waking up and not knowing if I was REALLY awake this time or not. Each time I have experiences like this, I am so tired and just ""zapped"" the next day."
388,Never had it,Sleepparalysis,5,I had sp for the first time in my life. I’m 20 and just recently got my last wisdom tooth taken out and they put me on a bunch of pills and one of them were oxycodon (Percocet) I’ve never been a drug user growing up and especially not now since I’m in the military. They took out my tooth on Friday and Saturday afternoon after I ate lunch I took all my pills and they put me to sleep. I remember waking up and opening my eyes and looking at my body and I couldn’t move. Then a little girl walks in and just walks up next to me after she stops next to me and turns to me I snap out of it. It’s weird considering the fact I’ve never had this happen before but is it normal for this to happen if I’m drugged out like I was? I don’t remember because scared or terrified when I saw that little girl walk in I just remember wanting to snap out of it which I did. Also I live with another marine who I would never mistake for that little girl.
389,My Strange experience Ft. Ronald McDonald,Sleepparalysis,2,"I had a really weird sleep paralysis last night, I have a chair by my bed and when I opened my eyes there was like a burnt zombie Ronald McDonald in grey tattered clothes. Normally I don't hear things but last night I did, it spoke to me and explained that Ronald McDonald is actually a demon named Nosferatu, (Thats actually Bram Stoker's Dracula), and the reason McDonald's is so wildly popular is the original owners sold their souls to him, and that all the McDonald's statues are idols built for him 

It was really weird but an almost plausible story"
390,just a question,Sleepparalysis,17,what's the most common thing people see/hear/feel during sleep paralysis?
391,Sudden change in SP,Sleepparalysis,1,"Hey! Now I've had sleep paralysis almost all my life up to this point. I just seem to be very prone to sleep paralysis for some reason. It's always actually not been that bad. What I mean, is that I never experienced any hallucinations, buzzing, shaking, etc. Almost all my life my sleep paralysis was literally just temporary paralysis. I could hear what was going on around me, I'd usually have my eyes open and not see anything aside from what was actually going on around me. The only thing was literally just the paralysis that would last no more than a minute. This all changed late last year. I woke up in sleep paralysis but it was so much different this time. I felt such intense shaking, I could feel myself vibrating. I was hearing so many things: buzzes, voices, ringing. My eyes were darting all over the place. And then all of a sudden I'd just snap out of it and be all sweaty. Naturally, I was terrified. I'd experienced sleep paralysis so many times before that I had gotten used to it but never something like this. And it'd just keep randomly happening whenever I'd drift off to sleep. It hasn't happened since we moved out of the house it happened in. I'm just confused. Why did it just start becoming so violent? My sleep paralysis had never been that bad before."
392,Black and White vision?,Sleepparalysis,3,I generally see the room in black and white when I experience sleep paralysis. I saw the girl from the ring coming out my tv. It all ended when i felt something tap my foot 3 times and i woke up. Does anyone else see the room theyre sleeping in in this detail? Thats not the first time something has tapped my foot to wake me up but thats for another post probably.
393,"Is this a sleep paralysis thing, or should I go see a sleep specialist?",Sleepparalysis,24,"Every blue moon, as I'm trying to fall asleep, I'll be rudely awakened by what I can only describe as a full on attack of the senses. I will see flashes of silver light, and it's combined with very loud metallic blaring siren sounds that sync up with the flashes. While this happens, I can also taste a metallic flavor in my mouth, too. It's very stressful, but it seems to also be connected to sleep paralysis, because when it happens I can't quite wake myself out of it and I'm kind of stuck in this very loud, very bright audiovisual loop for a while. Eventually I do wake up, but it starts again when I fall back asleep. So when this does happen, it makes me nervous to go back to sleep, and I often lose a few hours of sleep those nights.

Like I said, it doesn't happen often, maybe once every few years. But it's still something interesting that I want to learn more about, so if anyone has any leads on what this might be called or if it's normal, that would be helpful! Thanks!"
394,3 hours of SP,Sleepparalysis,5,"Last night I got off my pc to go to bed around 11:30,I was laying there watching a video and started to get a little tired around 12. I started to doze off and I though I had fallen asleep until I felt the usual SP feeing. My whole body was numb but also tingly, I felt pressure all over my body. I laid there waiting for it to get over, I can usually pull myself out of it and go back to sleep but this time was way different. Once I could feel I was coming out I was awake, I reached for my phone still half asleep, to check the time, 15 min had gone by since I set my phone down, and once my head hit the pillow I felt it pulling me back in. This kept going on for 3 hours, fighting to wake up and shake it off but every time I was close, I would be awake enough to open my eyes and move just a little, fighting it, I would get pulled back in again, and again. I was able to check my phone a couple times during this long episode. I was finally able to pull myself out of it. I got up to walk around and get some water but when I got to the bathroom I looked in the mirror and my eyes were both bloodshot and my body was shaking. This was the worst I have ever had it, usually just one or twice a night but this was terrible."
395,Any similar experience?,Sleepparalysis,0,When i SP i have the usual yes answers ears ringing can’t talk etc. but one no one else seems to mention is that my body also like cringes in a sense like all my muscles are contracting into the fetal position. I manage to move as i just had my second SP and was able to make it downstairs where it stopped twice during it. Any thoughts on this?
396,I had sleep paralysis and I think my dog knew it.,Sleepparalysis,12,"I've had sleep paralysis nearly all my life. I know you can't really tell what's real and what isn't while you are in sleep paralysis, but something weird happened. I was taking a nap in the afternoon and I had to get up soon. (that's when I'm most likely to get sleep paralysis). I was hearing and seeing things like one does in sleep paralysis. I think I tried to shout and then y felt my dog jump on the bed and lean close to me. It felt as if he heard me shouting in the sleep paralysis dimension. When I woke up he was indeed cuddling with me. I know this is crazy and impossible and most likely it was a hallucination, but it felt like he could see something was wrong.

Anyway, thought I might share"
397,So I think I experienced sleep paralysis for the first time last night,Sleepparalysis,6,"So just for some context, I'm currently 17 years old and have never experienced anything like this at all. I was never even made aware of this type of thing before I spoke about it to a friend earlier and he said it could have been sleep paralysis, I would just like to get some thoughts on this and any advice as to how to prevent this type of stuff from reoccurring would be amazing if possible.

I can't exactly remember what I was dreaming about prior to the incident, but I know it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. The last thing I can remember before waking up with complete clarity was this human like figure with absolutely no facial features what so ever under my bed sheets, practically face to face with me chanting these nonsensical phrases at me right until the moment I woke up. It only lasted a maximum of 5 minutes but when I awoke I was in cold sweats and completely out of breathe, never been this paranoid in my life and haven't slept since this incident. Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read."
398,Weird dreams and weird stuff happening,Sleepparalysis,1,"

So lately i’ve been dreaming about pretty weird stuff, i cant remember everything of course but im going to try to explain it to the best of my ability.

About 1 week ago i started dreaming more often amd i could remember them clearly when i woke up, but after about 2 days, some consistencies turned up, at the end of the dream i would start hearing weird noises. This of course didnt bother me until 2 days ago, when i woke up very early (about 6 in the morning) and the sound was still there, i jumped out of bed and turned on the lights and noticed that my window cover (a sliding cover since my roof is slanted) was pretty much wide open, my window is right under a street light so i ALWAYS close it because i need complete darkness to sleep. When i jumped up and turned on the lights in my room, the sound immediately stopped, its hard to explain the noise but it sounded like the flapping of a piece of clothing against the window. Im pretty sure that shouldnt have happened because thats my only window and there is never any draft in my room. I decided to just go downstairs and forget about it since i was probaply still just half asleep. 

This is where it got weird

I have a little decorative captain America shield on the desk in my room, which is next to the door (this is important for later) i started dreaming normally (superpowers and stuff) until i somehow got back to my home in my dream and in my dream i sat down behind my desk with the door open, when i look out of the door from my desk, i can see closet doors from across the hall, in my dream i remember that i start to fall asleep behind my desk and i could see out of the corner of my eye that the closet door started to open, when i looked up and blinked, it was all normal again, this happened once more. But the third time i looked up and the closet door kept opening. So i got scared and threw the captain America shield at the closet door (<- in my dream not irl for as far as i know) and then i jumped up out of my bed, scared. When i turned on the lights at, again 6 in the morning, the shield was gone and lying on the floor next to me, i was VERY sure the shield was still on my desk when i went to sleep.

Any clue to how this couldve happened?

I’ll add updates if i get more weird dreams."
399,Advice for helping with SP? New to this.,Sleepparalysis,3,"SP is new for me, it started a few months back and has become more regular as time has gone on. Probably due to the fact I work in a stressful job which requires shift working. It's starting to make me have difficulties going to sleep and I'm not resting properly which is starting to impact my work as I've been occasionally sleeping through my alarm for my early shifts. I am in the process of trying to get medical help as well but with the current situation with COVID it's taking a while and I'd rather find more therapeutic ways of dealing with it in case they're not too helpful or simply suggest meds to help me sleep or help with what they think is the cause.

I was wondering if anyone has advice on how to make this as easy as possible?

I've looked on the net but always feel it's best to ask people that actually experience it.

Oh just to save time, I'm a MH Nurse so I am already trying methods to alleviate the stress and the anxiety I feel sometimes, such as mindfullness etc. So I'm more looking for how to come out of it easier or how to try and prevent episodes other ways.

Edit: Also no advice to do with the supernatural please. I am not a believer that sleep paralysis is connected with paranormal happenings."
400,Location where Sleep Paralysis is most common?,Sleepparalysis,5,Hi all doing research for a current project. Curious if there's a location or town in America where Sleep Paralysis has been oddly common or most prominent?  Or have any of you found others in your town all having weirdly similar experiences?
401,Hypnagogic hallucinations and am I going to get sleep paraparalysis,Sleepparalysis,2,Lately I’ve been hearing these voice like hallucinations in my head where my coach and teammates are practicing and yelling whenever I’m falling asleep. Before that I’ve been hearing screeching noises like on that barrier of falling asleep. Last night I stayed up scared I was gonna have sleep paralysis should I be worried?
402,First instance of lucid dreaming while sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,1,"Hi yall. Been having sleeping paralysis ever since the start of coronavirus. At first it was bad, but its not as scary as before. I think it stems from my constant marijuana use and irregular sleep pattern (id sometimes fall asleep in living room with tv for a couple hours around midnight, wake up, smoke weed, then stay up for another couple hours before finally sleeping.

This post isnt about my problems with sleep paralysis, but rather, how i could use it to my benefit. Last night was the first time i lucid dreamt. I had napped from 12-2am then napped from 3-5am. I took a bong rip when i awoke, and tried to go back to sleep at 5:30,  i had a felt a strong pulsating in my head while i was in bed until i finally ignored it and just slept.

At this point, i had falllen asleep and had been transported to a place that looked like the kitchen in 'Family Guy'. Id looked at my hands and was so amazed to see how clear everything was. And across from the kitchen table in my 'family guy' reality was my older brother who told me i was lucid dreaming. I then imagined myself floating, and next thing you know, i was floating.

As i was floating, and overwhelming sense of excitement and disbelief came through me. I couldnt believe i was finally lucid dreaming! And i wasnt even trying! I got so excited, that i woke myself up into a sleep paralysis episode, sadly ending my dream.

So my question is, how do I obtain this state again? I know that ill probably end up napping and end up putting myself in a state of sleep paralysis, but how i do go immediately to lucid dreaming?

Thanks"
403,What have been some of your craziest sleep paralysis experiences and how do you handle them?,Sleepparalysis,6,"I’ve been seeing random post about this so I wanted to share my experience, specifically with “the shadow man”. 

I’ve had sleep paralysis as young as I can remember. My first memory of sleep paralysis was with 3 shadows standing around me as if they were examining me and talking about me. I was about 5?? Since then I’ve learned how to control it and have had some cool experiences out of it, like making myself elevate from my bed during the paralysis. This past year I had my first encounter with this “shadow man”. When I went into sleep paralysis and saw him I thought “Oh shit! This is the shadow figure I’ve heard everyone talk about!” 

I decided to confront it and yelled “WHAT DO YOU WANT?!” And felt my soul come out of my body as I pushed him back towards the door. Then for a split second I got scared and all of a sudden I was “back in my bed” and the shadow man was standing right over me, next to my bed. This is when I freaked out a little and made myself get out of this paralysis. 

The next time I had sleep paralysis I scanned my room to make sure he wasn’t there and he wasn’t. I then started getting this bad feeling creeping in, as if he was about to appear. Then the craziest thing happened. Not me, but an inner voice said ”I’m the daughter of Jesus and I’m protected”.  After that I felt calm and then I just woke up from the sleep paralysis like WTF. I was raised Christian but I don’t affiliate myself with the church and would consider myself spiritual. 

I’d love to hear about your thoughts on sleep paralysis as well as experiences!"
404,Sleep Paralysis every week,Sleepparalysis,3,"I’m curious about how often people get sleep paralysis. I will experience it multiple times a month. I could have sleep paralysis three times in a week or none in two weeks, but I will always have had it multiple times on a month. It has been years since I’ve seen any figures while having sleep paralysis. My experiences are now usually just the physical inability to move or speak whilst falling into sleep or waking from a nightmare. 

I’m sure everyone has experienced that struggle while trying to wake up from sleep paralysis. The initial sensation when you finally “break free” is just pure exhaustion, and there have been times when I’ve snapped out of one episode just to pass out afterwards and fall into a second sleep paralysis session or even a third. Lately I’ve developed the ability to force air in and out of my mouth whilst paralysed, making a sort of snorting noise. It’s usually loud enough to wake my girlfriend and she knows to shake me awake once she hears that noise. She’s gotten me out of so many sleep paralysis episodes and I’m super grateful. 

So, does anyone else experience anything similar to me? I’m so curious to find out."
405,HELP! (Cant find anything on the internet),Sleepparalysis,3,"I want to start off by telling y’all a little about myself.
So I’m a pretty light sleeper, I always going to sleep at all hours of the night. When I try to sleep early I end up waking up in the middle of the night not being able to sleep anymore.

I also am a very lucid dreamer. A lot of times I am aware that I am just dreaming and am able to “control” my dreams. I also have had the exact same dreams a few times. Also, I tend to be able to remember my dreams when I want. 

Like I had mentioned earlier I a very light sleeper right, well there’s only been a few times that I have entered a very deep sleep. Or at least that I’m aware of.  I used to think they were just heavy dreams. But after what happened this week I’m not so sure. 
Let me explain two things. 1)The past “deep sleep” 
2) what happened this week.


1) deep sleep- so I usually wake up with any small sound, even the sound of the water dripping off the bathroom faucet.  But these few times, my body was immobilized. My legs felt so so heavy! & I couldn’t feel my arms.. when my husband would wake up he would start talking to me and I could eventually hear everything he was saying . But I actually didn’t want to fully wake up. Because when I was like this, immobilized it was the only time I got some fucking decent sleep/ rest! So I zoned him out and slipped back into my dream. (Still immobilized) 

Iv always knew of sleep paralysis. The reason I don’t initially think these were sleeping paralysis is that everywhere I read or hear about it, they say it’s scary. But those times were not scary at all they were actually quite blissful. Everyone describes sleep paralysis like someone is on top of their chest. They feel like someone or something is watching them. For me, it wasn’t like that. At least not those times...


2) a few days ago, I went to bed like every other night. Except for this time In the middle of the night, I woke up and realized that yet again my body was immobilized. And like I actually like this, I closed my eyes and went back to sleep.  Then what I assume were some hours passed & I woke up again. Except for this time I was scared. I wasn’t terrified but I was scared . & I felt like right next to me (leveled)  there was a man's face looking right at me. I actually can’t remember his face exactly but I remember he was just inches away from my right hand.

A few things were different here from other times. I couldn’t fully wake, (I was actually trying). I couldn’t fully open my eyes either .... but after what felt like were minutes I got more annoyed than scared and physically swatted his face away.. I weakly lifted my hand and swatted where he was and he disappeared. Just like that. I then proceeded to slip back to my peaceful dream, still fully aware of what had happened. I later woke up still immobilized but will full control of my eyes and mind. Not wanting to stay in bed I was able to get up as nothing had happened.


I'm curious if this was actually sleep paralysis or something else. I can't find anything on google of slipping in and out of ""sleep paralysis"" so if anyone has anything please let me know! :)"
406,My first sleep paralysis experience,Sleepparalysis,2,My first experience was almost a year ago today. I was 16 years old and I was laying down on my back to go to sleep which I normally don’t do and all of a sudden I realize I can’t move and I feel a pressure on my chest pushing harder and harder and I started to panic. I tried to yell for my sister but I couldn’t speak. Then I heard these demon like noises screaming at me from all around (loud noises are one of my biggest fears) and I couldn’t cover my ears. I finally jerked awake. I realized that I had sleep paralysis and I looked up what caused it and it said sleeping on your back could cause it so I tried to go back to sleep on my side and it happened again. I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.
407,Very Strange Experience,Sleepparalysis,0,"Now I haven't had a sleep paralysis episode in years, but last night kinda gave me a curve ball. I was laying down imagining a senario for a dream. I had a video playing in the background for white noise. As I thought harder about it I could feel my body simulating it. (Feeling touching sensation and whatnot) but I wasn't asleep yet. Then I noticed I started breathing wierd, like I was snoring. And when I tried to correct it nothing happened, couldn't close my mouth, move my legs ECT. Then I just rode out my paralysis till I could move again. Couldn't go back to sleep for the rest of night."
408,SP or something else at Airbnb stay.,Sleepparalysis,1,"I was staying at a Airbnb just outside of Portland, and well I had a experience I will never forget. I was sleeping this blue lady was standing right next to my bed, but when I opened my eyes she was gone, but when I would lay down again and close my eyes she was back. Funny thing is I could still remember her expression on her face and what she was wearing. She looked angry, possibly disappointed, and wearing clothes from the 1800’s possibly early 1900’s. This happened three or four times before I finally just sat in bed till morning, freaking out.
It’s been almost a year now and I have no way to explain this, any help at explaining this event to me would be great.
Forgot to add that I could see through the blue lady as well."
409,Baby with SP?,Sleepparalysis,6,"I used to have sleep paralysis every night. I’ve seen mostly shadow figures watching me as I lie there, stuck. However, there were two occasions where I have seen a demon with yellow eyes observing me and the room I was in. I recently had a baby and since he was born I haven’t had an episode of SP. I have noticed, however, that my baby will cry or whine in his sleep. I guess I’m afraid that maybe my SP demons left me and are now toying with my 8 month old baby."
410,White flash of light,Sleepparalysis,6,"I’ve had many terrifying sleep paralysis episodes that have happened to me through the years that progressively seemed to evolve from seeing to hearing then actually feeling things. This episode was different from the others... I fell asleep in the afternoon after a stressful day at work and when I “woke up” I immediately knew I was having sleep paralysis. You already know It’s pointless to struggle since you can’t do nothing in that state other than look around but for me when I attempt to struggle this eerie beep that gets louder the more I “struggle” comes and it absolutely terrifying. Any ways as the sound was blaring in my ears I actually could feel myself moving in my paralysis and the beep was so loud it actually hurt, and at this moment I hear my father walking in the hall way talking on the phone and in my head I’m calling out for him cause this is actually the most terrifying thing I’ve experienced, I started to struggle more and as I felt like I lifted my upper body up (imagine a sideways floor push) a bright light flashed in my face IMMEDIATELY knocking me out and I woke up in a sweat and I remember it all vividly I know it happened and I don’t know if anyone else has experience such a thing.. might tell the other stories of my weird experiences"
411,What is this thing,Sleepparalysis,1,"So I’m still shaken up about this because all of this happened within the last hour and I just needed and explanation or someone’s opinion or something to calm myself down I guess.

So for some context I have been able to sense spirits for a while now. I used to live on an old burial ground when it first started. In my dads house we always talked about a ghost named Poline because that was the name of the previous resident that lived and died in the house. I always grow up with door knobs rattling being a normal thing right along with feeling like I wasn’t along being completely normal. Poline wasn’t a bad spirit. She was more like a guardian of the house and she had a very kind and pure soul that could be felt but I never saw her.

When I first started seeing and feeling spirits it was just the typical black silhouette that people tend to say they see out of the corner of their eye, but for me I could see them if I move to look right at them too. After a few years the feeling of this safe and warm presence that I came to know as Poline ended up disappearing and in its place I could feel two new presences. One was that of a middle aged man that lived in the basement but that would also walk around upstairs and knock on the walls. The other was that of a small girl that lives in the room separated by my bedroom by a curtain but she also hangs out in the attic. The attic has always scared me.

 So tonight I was sleeping and normally I can sleep really well. I usually wake up once or twice but that could be just to fix my pillows or to situate clothing that got too tight. Tonight I woke up at exactly 3:11 because my old dog that I’ve had for as long as I can remember started to bark. This dog, Shaina, and I grew apart over the past few years because my parents went through a divorce and I stayed with my mom for a long while. This being said, she almost never slept in the same bed with me and if she ever did then she left as soon as I started to pet her.

So I placed my hand on her rear and rubbed the fur to try and calm her down so I could go back to sleep and she laid down so I fell asleep really easily. At 3:18 I heard this weird deepish voice saying something like “You hear us” and other things similar to that. At first I thought it could be my dad because he wakes up really early for his job but then I realized that the voice was almost right beside me. My dad doesn’t stay in my room in the mornings if he ever even comes into my room so I opened my eyes right as the clock on my desk read 3:19. I figured I was hearing things so I went back to sleep while petting my dogs back legs.

I didn’t find it weird at the time but when I was telling my friend about this just a few moments ago I realized that all of my blankets had come completely off except for my one thin one. I’m not a person that kicks my blankets off unless it’s really hot and I’ve got an AC unit that points right at my bed so I know I wasn’t hot.

So after I fell back asleep I felt that something was near me but I didn’t know what because it was something I had never felt in my house before. At around 3:37 or 3:38 I heard the voice again but it was almost right beside my ear this time. I woke up and looked around my room but as I did I saw this weird old man in my room. He was thin and was balding slightly and it looked like he was wearing either an old sleeping gown or a mental ward robe. It was very obvious that he was extremely dirty and he was hunched over a lot. Right as my eyes had opened he screamed “You can hear us” and ran down the hallway while giggling to himself.

The entire second encounter with this old man happened in just a few short seconds but it felt like it lasted longer minutes. After he ran down the hallway I noticed that I felt like I couldn’t breath. I sat up in a fit and started to breath extremely heavily. I thought I was going to scream. I urged myself to scream but nothing would come out. Just short, shaky, deep breaths.

I’ve been awake now for about an hour since that happened and I can hear things getting moved around my kitchen. My dad listened to what I had to say but he doesn’t believe in the supernatural so I know he doesn’t really believe what I’m saying. So I was just hoping for some closure or maybe I’m hoping someone can explain what that thing was cause I don’t know if I can sleep again tonight."
412,Sleep Paralysis... or something different?,Sleepparalysis,4,"*Excuse the formatting, I’m on mobile*

I have experienced sleep paralysis many times throughout my life, it used to be a somewhat regular occurrence a few years ago. However, what I experienced last night was something very different. 

I used to have a LOT of issues sleeping a few years ago, but it has gotten so much better since my boyfriend and I moved in together about a year and a half ago. My night terrors and sleep paralysis pretty much went away completely, except for maybe a couple of episodes here and there. 

Last night, I experienced something that felt like sleep paralysis, but not... I woke up not being able to move, but I felt like I was physically being moved. I was sleeping towards the center of our bed but as I was waking up I felt like I was being pulled toward the edge. It was the most bizarre and terrifying feeling - especially since I myself wasn’t able to move. After a few moments I was able to move again and quickly moved back to my previous position and eventually went back to sleep. I then proceeded to have extremely vivid and horrific night terrors for the rest of the night. 

I guess I’m still a little freaked out about it all because I can’t explain what happened. Part of me thinks that I was just dreaming, but another part of me just doesn’t know. 

Has anyone had a similar experience with sleep paralysis or know what else it might be?"
413,"Got sleep paralysis twice, one was during a dream.",Sleepparalysis,2,"Typing this at midnight in my place. I remember that I was looking at a box of a HG sized Gundam model box, I took out the RPG weapon that was said to be a pen according to the box, but I felt that the pen was too small for my hand to write, despite the dimensions looking big. 

Then out of nowhere, I 'woke' up with my face on my phone screen, which was displaying an image of a Gundam head in yellow and black colour, then I started to feel drowsy. I tried to pry off my face on the phone but to no avail, this is when I realized I'm having sleep paralysis.

But that's not the end. After freeing myself, I woke up, and felt my whole body was unable to move. About 30-45 seconds, I finally retain control over my body, it was not until that I realize I was dreaming all along, considering that my phone is not next to me, but on the ground.

Truly felt that I was inside the Matrix, when laws of dimensions don't exist and myselg unable to unplug from the dream world. Does anybody have  similar experiences like me?"
414,Does anyone else have this?,Sleepparalysis,7,I get a 15-45 second sleep paralysis episode every two to three weeks and I don’t really get nightmares it’s usually when I’m face down on a pillow and can barely breathe I’m always scared I might start suffocating and my body won’t wake up because I’m already partially wake
415,First experience,Sleepparalysis,1,"My first experience with sleep paralysis was a few years back and it was terrifying. I was sleeping on a couch and my face was against a cushion so I couldn't see anything, but I could here a loud scrapping noise like the sound of pyramid head cleaver scrapping against floor."
416,Is there any way to force myself or guarantee that I'll experience sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,12,0
417,Some green person hiding,Sleepparalysis,6,"First I was dreaming about metal slug and the dream turned into some call of duty zombies and I saw a zombie that’s not even in the game and that’s when my sleep paralysis started I woke up and I couldn’t even move and that weird creature I saw was hiding behind my tv peeking and staring at me it had black eyes and white dots and I knew what was up and I closed my eyes and I think I made it worst because I started hearing some really loud noises inside my head, and I thought I was safe inside my eyes but then, I saw that creature’s head quickly approaching me like a jump scare and and when it hit me I woke up"
418,I think I'm in trouble.,Sleepparalysis,3,I was about to go into sleep paralysis but I was still about 90% conscious so I was able to escape it before it really begun. But now I think my sleep paralysis demon is gonna be mad because I basically just rejected his invitation.
419,Sleep paralysis attacks?,Sleepparalysis,0,"First off let me tell you about my sleep paralysis. I get it every 2 months about just randomly and for me I am fully awake and conscious like I am not seeing any demons or scared or anything. But the pressure is so immense on me, and my body is so like out of my control that I can’t breathe. So I’ll feel as if I’m suffocating which is awful until my body wakes up which can take quite a bit and I have to like manually do it by slowing gaining control of my hand. But anyways this makes my sleep paralysis overwhelmingly awful to go through every times but i have these really weird like “attacks” I guess you could call them. Basically they’re these like 30 minute periods where I am really tired and as I attempt to fall asleep I get sleep paralysis but once I snap out of it I have the least amount of energy I’ve ever had in my entire life. Like my body and mind just can’t be awake any longer so I fall back asleep and go straight into sleep paralysis and I’ll do this like 20 times over a 30 minute span until I finally can force myself to get out of bed. It only happens when I’m extremely tired in the first place like the only times it ever has happened is when I try to take naps during the day because I’m exhausted. It’s pretty rare too like it didn’t happens to me until like 2 years ago and I’ve probably been through it like 4 times but it’s so terrible when I do. My last one also got way worse than usual because I started falling asleep and waking up so much while being conscious through it all that my slivers of actual dreams i had were blending into my reality which scared me. And I don’t know if this is common or like if I’m literally the only person this happens and if it had a name or anything. But please let me know your thoughts or if this has ever happened to you"
420,Most vivid SP hallucination,Sleepparalysis,3,"I’ve dealt with SP for many years, most of my life actually (22F) and in all this time I’ve never had a hallucination this vivid and uncomfortable. 

Normally, I only get some slight auditory hallucinations. Like hearing voices talking to me, laughing, etc. Or, some very minor visual hallucinations like shadows in the corners or seeing things move under the blankets next to me. 

Anyway, one night I had the most intense hallucination I ever had and I can’t stop thinking about it. I was in that state where you kind of “wake up” and you realize your have sleep paralysis because you can’t move or speak. But then, I heard rustling at the foot of my bed. It sounded like someone was looking through bags on the floor or something. As I’m trying to shake myself out of my state of paralysis though, I see a dark figure slowly rise up at the foot of my bed and this dude was TALL. Then, I feel it start to crawl into the bed next to me and get closer to me. Once that figure is next to me, I feel like a snout rustle around my hair in the back of the head and the sound and feeling of it sniffing, like a dog would. 

I’ve never had full contact with one of my hallucinations before and never have actually felt it make contact with me.  It was a wild time for sure."
421,Sleep Paralysis or Abduction?,Sleepparalysis,3,"I've experienced sleep paralysis for about 8 years now. But my worst experience was probably the first time.  

I had gone to bed after a day of holiday shopping and video games. Nothing abnormal. It was maybe around 2-3 when i woke up because i felt like something was off. I realized I couldnt move, and started to panic. Maybe 2 seconds later a bright light flashed thru my window and i felt like what was electricity running thru my head. All i heard was this very low but loud humming. 

I also felt like my whole bed was being lifted but at the same time I was being pushed down into it like a magnet. 

Then just as fast as it came on. It felt like i fell back onto the bed. And i was able to move. I wasnt able to sleep at night for about a week after that.

I just want to know if anyone has ever experienced anything like that with SP. Especially the electricity part"
422,first time having it,Sleepparalysis,1,"Keep in mind I was only a kid and for some reason, I wouldn't want to go back to sleep until the sun was shining.

I wake up and realized I couldn't move, it was hard to breathe and my chest felt heavy, I was very confused until I heard a literal child/baby laughing right into my ear, it echoed, 3-7 seconds after that I could move and I'm not sure if this was a coincidence or not but in my kitchen doorway there was a dark shadow-like figure with a tall thin head waving with long fingers. This was the first time I slept on the sofa and I will never do it again. I also had nightmares of it. My mum didn't believe it so I kept it to myself as i thought nobody else would believe me. (I was a very dumb child)"
423,Is SP related to location?,Sleepparalysis,2,"I grew up in the UAE and I remember I used to get SP when I was younger but I dont remember much about the episodes. I moved to Canada in 6th grade and returned to the UAE in the 9th grade but those years I spent in Canada, I never had a sleep paralysis episode. However, when I moved back, I had several SP episodes and many of them were really creepy. 

I moved back to Canada for college and I have only had one sleep paralysis episode in my first year in dorms, but nothing since (Im gonna start my third year this September). Even when I visit the UAE for like Christmas or Summer break, I would have some SP episodes, but never in Canada (other than that one time). 

Has anyone else had this experience? Maybe not in different countries but different houses or cities? Its really weird to me, what do you guys think?"
424,Speaking an unkown language while sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,7,"I remember last night when I had the most confusing sleep paralysis ever. When I sleep I listen to youtube videos until I fall asleep. And when I had my sleep paralysis I remember listening to some techno futuristic ish music. My sleep paralysis demon didnt come but some kind of a futuristic soldier that resembled a pilot from titanfall. He had a gun and interogated me in some language I had never heared of before. But it sounded like a legit language that I understood a bit. It was so unique that it doesnt have similarities with language that I have heared.

After he was threatning he put his gun down and I spoke back to the language that he was speaking. I couldnt understand what I was speaking as if my mouth was moving on its own. But at the same time it felt like I could understand it? Idk what I was feeling and I couldnt comprehend what I was feeling at the same time. It was such an odd and unique experience. I know that it was a sleep paralysis when I woke myself up by controlling my breathing and closed my eyes. This is the first time I have experienced it and I regretted trying to end it there."
425,No demons? How many?,Sleepparalysis,4,"I'm fairly new to this sub. It seems like almost every post is about sp demons. My very first episode was I saw my runaway dog sitting on my chest. Not scary, but weird.  20 years later, every other episode was just not being able to move for a bit"
426,Multiple consecutive SP episodes on Stomach,Sleepparalysis,0,"Okay so I thought I’d share this since I haven’t seen many people talk about SP on their stomach. This happened last Summer and I was visiting my parents. I was taking a nap on the living room couch on my stomach, when I “woke up” and was in sleep paralysis. I couldn’t see anything as my face was buried into my pillow but I heard footsteps approaching me and sitting on the desk chair that was placed right next to the couch I was sleeping on. That was my dad’s chair and me and him were the only two people home so I assumed it was him. This lasted a while and Im used to SP but I was pissed because I just wanted to get some rest so I was trying to make some sort of movement or noise for him to wake me up. I eventually got out if it by wiggling my toes and I sat up and no one was on the chair, my dad was asleep in his room. I got freaked but immediately continued my nap.

I ended up having SP again, and this time the exact same thing happened. I once again started trying to get his attention to wake me up since I thought it was actually him this time. This is when I heard the chair move (like someone got up off of it) and heard footsteps approaching me. I then felt this sharp pain in the middle of my spine, almost like a knife or like someone just really digging their fingers into my spine. It really hurt and I eventually woke myself up again. Once again, no one was on that chair or in the room.

lol so I went back to nap because I was exhausted, but this time on my back, and I got SP a third time but I didn’t see anyone (it was daytime and I’ve always wondered if people see shadow figures in the daytime because that was the only SP episode I’ve had in the daytime) Anyways, I told my parents and they are extremely religious and told me all these prayers to do but Im not religious myself. Just the visual of my head buried into my pillow with my quiet shrieks asking for help and being met when this sharp pain in my back terrifies me and humors me at the same time."
427,Lasted 15 seconds,Sleepparalysis,2,Just experienced it for the first time and it lasted 15 seconds is that normal lol i just kept waggin my finger
428,Extreme pain consecutive nights in a row and ability to move?,Sleepparalysis,0,"For context I’ve had sleep paralysis on and off my entire life and from a young age and the dreams from when I was younger were primarily either a dark haired demonic lady sitting in the corner of my room and I could move and walk up to her but she wouldn’t move or it would be a dark figure at the end of my bed starring at me who’d eventually strangle me which I could feel but I’d wake up after ‘dying’ in the dream.

But recently 10 or so years later I’ve been having sleep paralysis night after night (in a new house)  after rarely having it for years. The first dream I woke up in my house and believed I was awake and entered the kitchen to get some water and my roommates were there but I felt slightly off about our interaction and began feeling dizzy so I ‘went back to bed’ and as soon as I laid back in my bed and closed my eyes I couldn’t breathe like as in gasping for air couldn’t breathe. I could hear my fathers voice telling me to stay alive as I felt like I was suffocating and slowly losing consciousness I truly believed I was dying in my sleep. I tried to stay awake and breathe but every breathe was so shallow I felt I was going to die soon so I reached my hand out to my dads and could feel it physically and out of nowhere I felt almost a claw puncture my arm after I reached out. The claw removed itself from my forearm and I could feel it reaching for my throat so I bit it and it felt so real as if I crunched into someone’s hand and then I woke up. When I woke up my forearm was in so much pain as if it had been stabbed yet no scratch marks or anything.

The second night I fell asleep and again in the dream ‘woke up’ in my bed thinking I was actually awake so I scrolled through my phone looking at a video I edited for a friend. The video felt unusual to what I remembered and then it slowly became disturbing as the footage was cut with things like ‘warning’ so I freaked out and closed my phone and attempted to ‘get back to sleep’. But I saw a large black almost branch like monster who was just like wires or branches and had claws nothing like anything I’d ever seen before and I felt compelled to ensure I didn’t see it’s face. I had an inkling I might’ve been dreaming so I tried to move my hands and feet a lot to wake up but in the middle of doing so I felt this uncontrollable urge to reach my hand out so I did and the monster punctured the top of my hand with its claw and after minutes of feeling extreme pain and having the monster come closer I woke up and my hand hurt like hell. But yet again no scratches cuts or anything just extreme pain.

I’m so confused at how extreme the pain is both in the dream and when I wake up? Is this sleep paralysis or something else. Does anyone have any idea why I can move in these dreams and feel pain so vividly?"
429,Sleep paralysis but from a third person perspective?,Sleepparalysis,1,"I've had sleep paralysis a few times in my life, usually after waking up at night then going back to sleep. My most recent one involved me in a slightly altered version of my bedroom but observing myself from a third person pov in a motionless state as a frog/spider hybrid slowly makes its way down to my body. 

I would struggle as normal and woke up just before the spider reached my face, most likely from fright.

Would this still be a sleep paralysis episode or just a vivid and very frightening dream?"
430,Sleep paralysis (black smiling entity),Sleepparalysis,9,"Sleep paralysis (or entity )

My uncle was telling me how he sufferers with sleep paralysis( at the time I didn’t think it was really real). A month later I have it about 3-4 times over the space of a month in a half, the most frightening one being when I was facing my wall asleep and could feel someone pulling my shoulder as if for me to turn round in my bed, I thought I was getting pulled by my mum or something so just ignored it and used all my strength to keep facing the wall as I was half asleep, and didn’t want to be disturbed. however whatever pulled me over was able to turn my whole body around slowly but without a struggle and as I realised there was this slender really tall all black figure standing over me and all I could see was it’s white teeth smiling at me, it then turns me over and I went back to sleep( I couldnt move this whole time) I could not even move my mouth to shout(normally I shout for Jesus as I am a Christian and this call always works) really has scared me till this day as I wonder what really happened, I know it’s not a dream as I can tell the difference between the two and like I said I was being physically turned over, anyone had similar experience to this ? As my cousin who is my uncles son said he has seen a very similar thing in the night whilst not being able to move."
431,Happened a few minutes ago,Sleepparalysis,0,"I haven't had any problems for months now, and then it suddenly happens when I just wanted to close my eyes for a while.. I was tired from reading this one manga, and didn't expect to fall asleep. The worst part for me is the constant ringing in my ears. It was always a woman's high-pitched screaming ringing non-stop, but this is time it was different.. Maybe because it wasn't at night? Even though it hadn't happened for a long time, I was still very adjusted to it. There wasn't any demons, thank god.. I still remember the first time it happened. Just imagine going to sleep and then seeing a creepy girl and some monsters behind her slowly opening your door, not being able to move, and hearing some woman screaming. I had no idea what the hell was going on, but I eventually started making use of it to do whatever I wanted, because I found out I always have a lucid dream after. This time though, I wanted to quickly get up and continue my manga. I wasn't even scared, just annoyed that it took so much effort to wake up. You know how it usually occurs in the place you fall asleep? Yeah, I wasn't really scared because it was really bright outside. I tried to open my eyes, but I didn't even know if I was really opening them. I don't know how to describe it, but it's hard to differentiate if you're actually moving, or if you just think you are but you're actually not. It was annoying, since I knew what was going on. First thing I did when I woke up was open my phone. No hesitation/."
432,Recurring Sleep Paralysis,Sleepparalysis,1,"I've always had sleeping problems. Even when I was a kid, I would have nightmares every night and frequently experience sleep paralysis, and if I didn't have a nightmare then I wouldn't have a dream at all. Or at least I wouldn't have remembered it even just after I woke up. Eventually, I guess I grew out of it. Sparsely I would have nightmares and eventually more sleep paralysis. Then I moved out of my house and rented it out, then my family moved back in. The house is really old for the area. Like REALLY old, one of the oldest in the town. It has some history to it. It used to be some sort of hotel, then eventually a stable, then a house. The problems I had as a kid started up again when I moved back but that was almost two years ago and I haven't had any problems since. Then my grandma came to visit my family from out of state for about 15 days. My mom decided she would stay in my room and I was sent out to an extra little room not connected to my house that is more of a little storage attachment stuck onto the garage, which is also not connected to my house. This was literally just a room, with a bed in it and some of my cousin's things, (she was living with us at the time and stored some of her stuff in there). This was just at the end of February and start of March 2020. I moved my stuff out there like my PC and my Xbox and the first couple of days were great. More than great, actually, I loved it, even considered asking my mom to let me stay out there. I had my own space, felt like I was on my own, and listened to music as loud as I wanted, stayed up as late as I wanted, and felt more motivated with my school work. Being more isolated helped me focus, and I looked forward to my alone time after school. Soon, this feeling changed. First, I started waking up at 3:05 or 3:10. I would wake up and hear movement around me. Above me, outside the window, near the door, in the garage. The first night when I awoke, I couldn't move, I was stuck on my stomach, facing the window. I heard voices, not super loud, more like louder than whispering but not quite talking, outside the window I was facing. I couldn't see anything, because it was completely dark in the room besides a tiny bit of light from my monitors but, I couldn't see anything but the side of my bed, the floor and a tiny bit of the windows next to me. So it was completely dark. I shut my eyes, trying to force myself out of the experience. (Side note, whenever I have a nightmare, I almost get lucid, but when it becomes too scary, I become lucid, and somehow wake myself up.) This was not working, and it never has during sleep paralysis. I tensed up my eyes and just kept trying. The more I fought, the worse it got, voices were inside now, louder and louder closer and closer, they just kept saying over and over, ""10 months, 10 months, 10 months"". And then silence. A moment later directly in front of my face I felt something move. All I heard, was ""You are going to die in 10 months."" I opened my eyes as the sentence finished, and was met with a flash of bright yellow orange and white lights, and the loudest BOOM sound I have ever heard. It was like a bomb blew up 3 inches from my face. My eyes shut again and the force of the explosion pushed me onto my back, right then, I woke up for real and had control of my body, and I shot upright and pretty much freaked out. I looked at the time, 3:05. I called my girlfriend and told her what happened, and she calmed me down. I just watched Netflix and YouTube for the rest of the night until I had to get up for school that morning. The next day I told my friends at lunch, and they were thoroughly freaked out, but told me about some scary dreams of their own and calmed me down, reassuring me it was just a dream, and nothing to worry about. The next night, I woke up to the same thing as the night before. Voices, outside the window. But this time, something was off. I could sense that something was in the room. Right in the middle of the room. I could here it moving on the carpet. Once again I couldn't move. I couldn't see. I felt the bed move as it climbed on. Two steps closer to me. And then it stopped, and sat right on my back, holding me down. The voices continued outside the window and I felt the weight shift. The fucking weight of the thing sitting on my back moved closer. Right behind my head. I could hear it breathing in my ear. Inhaling. Exhaling, the breath hitting the back of my neck. Then it got up, and left. I had control again, and shot upright. I looked around, and there was nothing there. Checked my phone, 3:05. I thought about calling my girlfriend again, but didn't want to wake her up a 2nd night in a row. I just watched more YouTube and Netflix until it was time for me to leave for school. The next night, I stayed up later, in an attempt to sleep through that damned 3:05 AM to see if it would make a difference. I slept through, but only to 3:10 AM. Fuck. This time, no sleep paralysis. I had control, and I was tired. But I couldn't figure out why I was awake. I shook it off and went back to sleep. Uneventful night. Caught up on the sleep I lost and headed off to school for the day. Then, every night for the next couple of days, I would wake up at 3:10 again, or somewhere close to it. Really anytime between 3:10 and 3:20, but always around then. I would just shrug it off and head back to sleep. Then eventually, I woke up to loud knocking, LOUD. I couldn't tell where it was from, but I just shot up and went to grab my car keys, assuming it was morning and my Dad was knocking at the door to ask me to move my car so he could back his out of the driveway. But after my sleepiness wore off, just as I was putting my first foot onto the floor from the bed, I realized it was dark out. I checked my phone, sometime just before 3:10. I looked around, saw nothing out of place, and tried to go back to bed. This wasn't the first time I've randomly woken up to a knocking sound. So I tried to get back to sleep. Just as I was drifting off, right at the point where you sometimes feel like you are falling off a building and shake awake, I heard the knock again. This time I shot up and looked out the window to the area outside the door. There was nothing, and no one there. I didn't really expect to see someone there. The knocking didn't really come from a certain direction, it was just heard in my ears, maybe even just in my head. Eventually, I got back to sleep. The next night, was one of the worst. I consider this to be my experience in the back rooms. something I didn't really know about until after this happened, while trying to figure out what any of this even means. I woke up, or I thought I did at least. Laying on my back, I opened my eyes to see the ceiling. Then I fell, down, into my bed, I leaned back and back farther and farther and felt a weird rush around my like when you break the surface tension of the water in a pool. It was like I fell through a painting in Super Mario 64. As I passed through the threshold into some sort of office building or something. But I had come out of the wall. The bottom of my bed shared the same face as the wall. I had control of my body, I could move, walk, stick my hand up to the wall. But I felt weird. Almost like I was sleep walking or something. Like when you wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, you don't really know what's going on too much, just more like you are there. I turned around a looked at my surroundings. Narrow hallways, almost like a hotel. No doors, just hallways. Tons and tons of hallways, each splitting off into more and more. The carpet was a weird dirty beige brown color, and the wallpaper similar, but a lighter beige, almost yellow, but not quite. The wallpaper was peeling in some areas, but was white underneath. I walked around. Down one hallway, into another, noticing some open up into a room, these rooms had 2 solid walls, but the other 2 went to more hallways. I just kept going. I was just wondering around for what felt like 45 minutes or so. Then from far, really far, maybe 200 ft down the hallway I was currently on. I could see some sort of black figure, peeking out from behind the wall. I stopped. It never occurred to me that I wasn't the only person, or thing rather, that was in there. I began running. Running down this hall, then that, left, right, left, right. Not thinking about what I was doing. Then I saw an area with a bunch of rooms. This part of whatever place I was in, or dreamed I was in, was dimly lit. I picked a room, and ducked into it. This one had 3 solid walls. Only one hall in, and one hall out. I realized I had no clue where I was and no way to get back to where I was. I was hopelessly lost. Then, I saw it turn the corner. The black figure, shaped like a human, but all black. Dark black with no lines or anything. Similar to those black body suits some people wear for Halloween. But this one wasn't a fabric, it was rubbery almost, like skin but smoother. It was maybe 50 ft away, and it definitely saw me. I was fucked. I had nowhere to go. Unexpectedly the figure took a right and went down another hall. I was confused, was it letting me go? Where was I? What is that thing? My mind was racing and my adrenaline was pumping. I looked around the room, and saw it. Behind me, coming out of the wall, it's hands outstretched, clawing at me, it's upper body through to this side of the wall. I turned tail and fucking ran. I ran and ran, through any random hall. Left and right through the fucked up place I was stuck in. After running for hours. I was exhausted. I was sure I had lost it at this point and began to hit the walls in frustration, in anger, I was screaming. I hit a wall with all my force, and slipped right through it. I felt my body fall into the wall and I was leaning down, almost like I was going to touch my toes, and I was back in my bed leaning upright sitting in my bed. Back home. I was speechless. Tears formed in my eyes. I turned on my phone, and saw it was 3:05 AM. Dammit. I once again watched YouTube and Netflix on my phone until I had to leave for school. At this point, there were only 3 days until my Grandma left. 2 more nights I had to stay in that damned room. I told my friends about it and we ended up finding that backrooms creepy pasta, which was eerily similar to my experience the night before. I've yet to have another dream like that, and I hope I never will again. The next nights were fine, I slept pretty well and would still wake up in odd hours but it wasn't 3 am anymore. It would be like 2am or 5am and I would go right back to sleep. Eventually, I was back in my actual room, in my house. Soon after I had sleep paralysis again. I have a projector screen covering one of my walls completely. I woke up, and heard the voices, saying ""10 months, 10 months, 10 months"" just like the first night, and I could see someone standing behind the projector screen, a undeniable, outline of a person, right behind the screen. Since then, I haven't had any issues and slept pretty well in my room. But recently, I went to spend the night at my girlfriends house. I had sleep paralysis again, and I heard the voices, ""10 months 10 months 10 months"" over and over, not even synced up, just like 20 people saying it starting and stopping at different times. I could feel the weight of that thing on top of me. Then it was over. I turned and saw my girlfriend, back turned to me on the opposite side of the bed. Is this an issue that occurs when I change the place I am sleeping? What is up with the 10 months thing? What the fuck was the dream? Am I going crazy? Should I go see someone like a therapist or something?"
433,"Trying to sleep but every 10secs I drift off I feel my body paralysed and I can't breathe, it jolts me up and I force myself to breathe? I'm scared I've only had 2 hours sleep in 2 days because of this. Anyone had similar?",Sleepparalysis,4,"I'm 25 F, obese but not morbidly so. I'm 220lbs and 5ft8, concerned it's possibly sleep apnoea. I've literally had no proper sleep in days partly due to stress etc, and now whenever I'm drifting off I feel the absolute fear and dread as I'm literally paralysed and my heart feels like it's stopped and I'm not breathing.. I struggle for a few seconds in this state and wake gasping, heart beating, then drift off again from pure exhaustion, and the process repeats. It's so hard to describe. It's happened like 10 times in the last half hour, my body freezes like I'm dead and I have to wake up. Jolting myself awake to breathe as I can feel myself trapped, literally stuck in suffocation as I drift off. 😭😭. I neeeeeed sleep. I've forced music on now to keep myself awake as I can't do it, I can't have this feeling when I'm trying to sleep. I'm so so tired."
434,Sleep Paralysis in Its Okay to Not be Okay (Kdrama),Sleepparalysis,0,"Was watching this Kdrama on Netflix when [this ](https://youtu.be/KpVKFpkudxs) scene portraying sleep paralysis came up. Was actually surprised since this was the first time I’ve seen this portrayed on screen in something that isn’t a horror movie or series. The drama isn’t a horror or supernatural series (as the viewer you actually know that her hallucination isn’t a ghost or vengeful spirit but rather a result of her trauma >!from her abusive mother who is alive!<) so to have this scene that had the viewers feeling empathy for the character and what she suffered from and not supernatural fear about SP was kind of touching. I found her heavy breathing and screaming spot on. SP is no joke. I was actually able to point out to my family who was watching with me that that was exactly how I feel when I have SP. 

Just some clarification on the drama: the title is It’s Okay to Not be Okay. The series focuses on mental disorders with the male lead being a caretaker at a mental hospital and his older brother having autism and the female main character having an antisocial personality disorder. I highly recommend it if you’re looking for something to watch on Netflix. This drama actually opened a lot of discussion about mental disorders in Korea where it’s usually viewed as taboo (it’s pretty taboo in a lot of asian countries actually, source: I’m Filipino) I’ve actually had some friends ask me about sleep paralysis after watching this scene"
435,My Sleep Paralysis Demon is an Anime Girl,Sleepparalysis,3,"One night, when I was sleeping, I awoke to a presence in my room. I wasn't facing the same direction where it was but i was definitely sure something was there. Even though i wasn't looking at it, I can kinda see it vaguely as if i had eyes behind my back that needed prescription glasses.

I tried to focused on the monster in the corner, then I saw it.

It was a fricking anime girl looking at me in the darkness.

Even though there was literally nothing scary about her look, there was still something menacing about her, I just don't know what.

Maybe it's an attempt of my sleep paralysis demon to be cute yet terrifying, or something.

People get scary ghosts or the devil as their sleep paralysis demon that likes to hover and spook them and stuff.

But here I am, getting an anime girl as my demon, just stalking me in the corner.

To be honest, I've noticed that most of my sleep paralysis demons aren't scary, they're more of a budget film ghost antagonist. But this time, I was just confused.

It just feels like my demon gave up and was like ""eh whatever, I suck at being scary anway, so let's be an anime girl this time around!""

Also, since a lot of my nightmares/sleep paralysis turn into either good or lucid dreams,

When I was nearing the end of my dream, I also had a chance to fight and have an epic battle with my sleep paralysis demon.

So yeah, i'll say it was a pretty awesome night."
436,I had a terrifying dream that ended in paralysis,Sleepparalysis,2,"This is an account of the dream I had last night, which woke me up at about 4:10 in the morning, and my first struggle with sleep paralysis.

The dream began with me returning to my home, although it was a place I’d never been before. The house was beautiful, with Spanish tile covering the floors, large planters along the walls filled with large overgrown rose bushes and mother-in-law’s tongue, but it was dark and empty and something felt misaligned, like there was something sinister there. The bathroom resembled the one from my childhood home in a way, the layout and the size of it, but there were old fashioned rotating fans hung high up on the walls. The wiring had been crossed somehow, and in my dream when I flipped the switch the light fixtures spun in slow circles instead of turning on. I remember sensing someone else in the house so I walked into the adjoining different rooms, an entryway, and a kitchen, both dark and empty.

And suddenly there was a woman there with me, with dark hair in a beetle-bob haircut down to her shoulders and white gown. She looked to be late forties, and she was scared. She began telling me about a dream that she had, and I was seeing the dream though her eyes as she spoke. She said she had been standing in a street market that was filled with people. From across the crowd she could see a man coming towards her, and as he walked past the people and stalls, he was reaching out and touching everything he passed. She knew that he was going to reach her and that he was going to touch her and that it was going to hurt. I envisioned his hands black with dried blood, and he was holding a sharp object, or else his nails were long and sharp. It was hard to tell for all the blood. He moved slowly toward her and she said his name was Euvan. She kept repeating how it was going to hurt when he touched her.

And then I woke up in my bed, lying on my back. But I was unable to move my body. I remember trying to sit up and focusing my attention on my arms, trying to get them to move so it would break the spell but for a while I couldn’t. I remember saying the name “Euvan” out loud. I also remember the sensation of hands running over my body, up and down my legs and chest and arms in waves. And then it stopped and I could move again.

I’ve never heard the name Euvan before, didn’t know it existed before last night.

&#x200B;

Edit: I had this dream about five months ago, well before Covid-19 could have influenced it.  This is the original text that I wrote down at four in the morning that night, but I am just posting it now because it is the first time I've thought of it since Covid, and it somehow strikes me as more meaningful now.  Maybe I'm reaching for straws, maybe I got a premonition of sorts.

Also, I believe in magic.  I do not base my life around it, but I believe enough to not want to give any power to whatever this feeling might be.  So I changed the name of the man in the stalls a little.  

After that night, I couldn't shake the heavy feeling that dream left, and went to a yoga to the people class, which i never do, in order to work it out and relieve the tension, but that day and the day after felt darker and heavier.

I haven't had sleep paralysis since, or anything else as ooky spooky.  Right now, I believe this was a glimpse into the current reality, from the distorted vantage point of a different mindset. But who knows? Has anyone else met Euvan or heard of it?  Other singular experiences that shook you like this?

438,SP,Sleepparalysis,1,have you guys ever encountered a man with no face? just eye sockets
439,Anyone have any experiences with death talking to them?,Sleepparalysis,20,"Long post 

Man in all white throwing things at me
First it was stuffed animals then it became books. Once a chair. He kept talking in a dark voice that sounded like death. Eventually he started to get close. Leaning in and sayin things in. A harsh voice. All I could make out is do you want to die and I am going to kill you. He kept getting closer. Right before it stopped he got up to my face and I could see him. It was an all white suit. Skull for a face. It felt like the grim reaper. The whole time I couldn't move, I thoughr he was going to stab me. I kept trying to scream and move but I couldn't. He kept asking me if I wanted to die. I couldn't talk. I couldn't move. The last thing I saw him have was a knife. 


This was after two nightmares I slightly remember. Well one was a weord dream. All I remember was being at work and weird stuff kept happening and I had random people on my phone background. Eventually I realized something was really of and ""woke up"" into what became more of a nightmare. I was on a group FaceTime call with these 4 random people. They wouldn't tell me their age or name. At first I thought I was actually awake but soon realized something was off again. They kept talking about random shit. Then I realized i was for sure dreaming still when I saw a second window in my room behind my head and a shadow figure walking past it then walking past my other window (I live on the second floor) at this point I knew something bad was coming. I turned around and tried to go back to sleep, which I did. But when I ""woke up"" again is when I saw the reaper sitting on my bean bag chair. At first he looked like the shadaw figure from before. At this point I couldn't move or talk. I was stuck. Thats when he started asking if I wanted to die and throwing the physical objects at me. I swear I coild feel them hitting me. His voice was so harsh and slightly deep. Exactly what I think death would sound like. I actually woke up shaking. Not sure if I was actually awake. Not sure if I was going to meet another demon. Pretty much no sleep the whole night


I'm sorry for the bad wording but I wrote this as soon as I got out of that, I was really tired but I decided to write my experiences down now when I have them to better describe them"
440,I’m just a wee bit too terrified to go to sleep,Sleepparalysis,3,"Let me preface this story by saying, I don’t think I’ve ever experienced SP before last night. Not too sure if it was SP, I have the normal (what would be normal for me) vivid nightmares here and there; however, I’ve never once woken up and not been able to move before last night. I normally fight any bad dreams by sleeping with my portable ac unit set to 64 degrees f and a blanket that isn’t too thick but isn’t too thin. I halfway on my side and on my stomach holding onto a pillow for comfort, and I’m 19 weeks pregnant, so vivid or weird dreams aren’t uncommon for me. I’m extremely intuitive, I have dreams that tend to come true, and I’m in tuned with everything going on around me and I normally have a sense for what is going on. 

Last night was one of the more terrifying nights of my life, I’ve come close to death, experienced it, I’ve seen terrifying and horrible things, but those experiences are nothing compared to the feelings I had last night. I was exhausted, I could definitely fall asleep fast if I had wanted to, but every time I attempted to fall asleep, I’d wake up in utter darkness unable to move. It’s as if my body fell asleep instantly but my brain was wide awake. I’ve heard stories of SP, most of which were people waking up not able to move from the dead of sleep, I’ve never heard of someone falling asleep and instantly experiencing SP. At first if felt like I was laying in bed comfortable, next thing I knew it felt like I was talking to someone but I couldn’t move, in my head my son was right next to me and the tv was one but it was only white noise. I turned off the tv, then I realized afterwards I couldn’t move. I had to force myself to move, I figured by concentrating on the smaller appendages I could force myself to move, which worked. I realized what happened, what I felt, what I saw, was not real. I checked my phone to see not even a few minutes have passed. I figured it was a one time occurrence and I could just try and go back to sleep again. I was extremely wrong. The night followed with 3 more occurrences of thinking I fell asleep, seeing pitch black and then trying to move. All three times, I forced myself to move, small appendages first, then my whole body would jolt and jerk up as if they were already in motion. My last attempt at trying to go to sleep was the most terrifying, it started the same, seeing pitch black but this time I was hard to move, it felt as if something was after me, it’s all pitch black but I know it’s there, it felt like it took forever to try and move. I finally was able to move and decided to just stay awake until I had to go to work. 

I thought that was the end of it and I wanted to take a nap when I returned home from work but I couldn’t, I have a 2 year old to take care of and a house to clean and mommy’s day doesn’t stop just because she had a (pardon my language) shitty night. When it was his time to take a nap, of course it was a perfect opportunity for me to nap as well. I did my normal routine: AC at 64 and a blanket to cover myself. I tried to fall asleep and it’s like I instantly fall into a dream, except I’m completely aware of my body, I felt a grab at my side and woke up, couldn’t move, mentally I couldn’t even fight it so I jump from one dream to another each time waking up not being able to move until finally I’m able to fall asleep, and stay asleep. I woke up in the same position finally able to move, I still feel tired and exhausted but honestly, I’m terrified to sleep. I’ve been anxious about sleeping during times of my life, but this is the worst it’s ever been. If I could just have someone to talk to about this, to talk about anything that would be great. 

I apologize at my lack of story telling skills, or even reddit etiquette, I’ve never really posted before and naturally I’m a 5 year old when it comes to telling stories. I do appreciate anyone who has the time to read this, thank you."
441,Demonic Growl and Astral Projection,Sleepparalysis,15," I have had sleep paralysis quite a few times once felt as though something was pinning me down on my chest and heard this insane demonic growl.  

A couple of those sleep paralysis experiences I had what I believe to be astral projection instances accompanying them. I know that sounds CRAZY but I was standing up and on the side of my bed looking at myself. Even weirder was I tried to walk away and was able to make it to the foot of the and it was the most intense experience. it was as though I was walking through gelatin it took all my strength to move and was very warm feeling. I was so freaked out and I was pulled back into my body and woke up. The second time it happened I fought through that thickness and made it into the hallway and was too scared to go any further it was as though something was telling me if I went further I wouldnt make it back. I know it sounds crazy but I cannot explain it. 

Shortly after I got divorced and moved from that apartment that my kids and ex wife swore  was haunted. Idk about that because I never experienced anything strange there besides the sleep paralysis. Has anyone else experienced that astral projection and feeling of walking through jello?"

444,Sleep Paralysis or Real Demonic Attempt?,Sleepparalysis,24,"A day before my first SP happened, I got this weird bruise mark around my Adam Apple's area, as if've been brutally punched - there was no pain felt tho. The next day, the bruise's gone, so I kinda ignored it and thought maybe I strained my vocal chord too much - i'm an aspiring singer. 

But later at night, 5:00am sharp. I was suddenly awoken, lying back on my bed accompanied by the bedroom light. But i couldn't move an inch, few seconds after that realization, an eerie weird whispering female voice came onto my left ear. 

She was murmuring so fast and I could pick up only certain consonants over it, and I belive she speaks a Buddha Mantra (a spell from the traditional culture for asian countried like Thailand/Myanmar - I'm a Muslim Malaysian tho)

I was in shocked, couldn't move anything. I tried to scream and recite a holy verse to arm myself with, but the whispering went louder. The only body part I could move was my right fist. 

I clenched my fist so hard until I could lift it to stomp my bed sheet. And right after I did that, the whisper dissappeared, but I still was unable to move normally. 

So i closed my eyes and few tears were out. I keep on praying inside. After 10minutes I can finally move my legs and the others one by one. 

So.. i'm posting this onto both SP and Paranormal communities, hoping to find a new information so that I could track the murmurs, I know it means something.

445,Tones causing terror?,Sleepparalysis,3,"I felt like I maybe woke up or I was dreaming, I can’t tell what state I was in. But I started to be aware of a tone just within or almost just out of my range of hearing. It piqued my interest. I felt like I had to focus more and more on that tone. But as I mentally zeroed in on the sound, it immediately changed, like it knew I was aware of it and I immediately was overwhelmed with fear. Odd, because a tone or a frequency isn’t scary, like at all. But I was just stuck there, terrified, hearing this tone. Then after a while, I became less scared and then sat up, got my phone and scrolled the reddit scroll to get my mind on something else."
446,Sleep paralysis linked to address?,Sleepparalysis,0,"     While in my late teens I had to move back in with my mother. She had just recently moved into a house on wises grove rd in new Brighton pa, usa. She tended a horse farm in exchange for living quarters and a stable for her horse. I moved into and empty room in the upstairs that had two closets; one on each side of the room and the length of the room. It was filler area for where the roof of the house sloped. 
     I had no possessions due to moving around so much in my teens. I abandoned everything but my bass guitar and some knives as well as a bag of clothing and work boots. I made a mattress out of old couch cushions and a sheet. The rest of the room was bare beside a broken vacuum cleaner I used as a coat rack. 
     The first night I stayed in the room I got an overwhelming feeling of something not right in the room. Just a general bad feeling. (I am really sensitive to subtle energy changes.) This was a feeling I hadn't felt in quite some time. I played it off as it was my first night in the new place with new noises and new energy to get used to. I slept fine with no interruptions other then getting used to sleeping on cushions. 
     I wish I could say the same for the next night but, I can not. I set up my bed as I usually did, you know the night previous set the standard. As I laid in 'bed' i got that feeling again; this time worse. I felt myself tear up for an unknown reason. I felt terror and dread. I have never felt those before, not like this.
     I woke up at about 1 am. I am frozen solid. I try to speak but can not. I try to move but I can not. There is someone in the room. They are sitting on the edge of the right side of the bed toward my feet. I feel as though if my body could work it would only pee on itself. To make things worse; I was in an actual bed with blankets that were white and the room was decorated with things that were not mine. Dressers and  pictures lined walls. 
     The person on the edge of my bed looked horrid. It was a little boy that was badly burnt. He was trying to get me to help him and after I saw him k wanted to help. But I couldn't move. He got up and walked to the door and dissapeared. I woke up when my alarm went off for work. Confused. 
     The very next night: I wake up at around 1 am. I can not move. I am not scared when I see the boy on my bed. He asked me to follow him he has to show me what happened to him. I sit up in bed but my legs were glued to the mattress. I looked back to see me laying on the floor still asleep on my cushions through the bed. I turn to reach for the boy but he was gone. 
     I moved in with the girl I am still with today. Have never experienced anything like that before nor after this. It was the creepiest and coolest thing I have ever experienced. I know some of you are going to be mad by me saying this but I feel as though if I would have chosen to stay with mom I may have eventually gotten up. If I would have gotten up this thing may have kept me or taught me something. The idea is amusing and I wish I would have stayed to find out what happened to the little boy or what would have happened to me if I tried to help."
447,SP Back after Having Baby,Sleepparalysis,14,"Hi all I’m new to this subreddit. I dealt with sleep paralysis a lot when I was going through my undergrad. After graduating, it started to get less and less until I didn’t have those types of dreams anymore. 

I had my daughter back in April of this year and the sleep paralysis is back. Has anyone else experienced a gap in sleep paralysis brought back by a major life event? Could it be the sleep deprivation? 

For some context, I also work full time and am getting my MBA online but I don’t feel any more stressed than usual. In fact, I love where I work and don’t stress about it."

451,Does anyone here think sleep paralysis is paranormal?,Sleepparalysis,6,"WARNING: might scare some people :) 

Okay, so last night I had sleep paralysis. I’ve had it before, but this was my first time actually FEELING something. In my dream there was a baby on a table and I picked it up to hold it. I was staring at the cute baby, looked away for a second, and then looked back down and it turned into a scary witch looking baby and he had a huge nose and the scariest smile, like, ever. And then I heard my boyfriend (who was not with me irl or in my dream) whisper in my ear “don’t be scared” or “don’t worry” or “it’s okay” or something to that affect and then I could literally FEEL someone pressed against my hip bones super hard. Then I opened my eyes (I think?) and felt a hand wrap tightly around mine and I looked down at it, but I didn’t look past the hand because I didn’t want to be scared. I eventually woke my self up by blinking repetitively and moving my toes. 

Anyways, I’m kinda religious, but more than that, I used to see the same ghost everyday for like 3 weeks when I was about 5 (I’m 19 now) in the daytime or sometimes nighttime when I was clearly not dreaming. 

Any thoughts/reassurances?"
452,A personal theory on what causes sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,6,"I am not a doctor of any kind.

A little background on personal experience. I have had sleep paralysis on and off since I was about eight years old. Like every other normal person it was a terrifying experience.

I have always been curious about psychology and have actively studied it in my spare time. I also have been also been fascinated by dreams. Sorry to get off topic from the start but come on they are like hallucinations without dangerous chemical effects. 

What I do know about what happens to the body when someone falls asleep is. The brain will actually  change its signal pattern and release a small amount of chemicals from one gland or other to induced paralysis in the body. Which a lack of can cause sleep walking and things of that nature. 

So as I said I get sleep paralysis. At first absolutely terrified of the whole experience. My symptoms were the aware of the room around me and a shadow person standing next to my bed just staring at me with glowing eyes. It got worse when more shadow people would come until eventually my room was a blask mass with ten or so sets of glowing eyes. They would just be there looking at me, they didn't touch me or grab me, nothing. So I kind of stopped being afraid of them after a while.

Enough times of this happening I got curious. I tried my hardest to say something to them or touch them but that didn't work but something did happen I would get out of paralysis faster. The fact I was aware of what was happening and trying to stay in sleep paralysis to interact some how would bring me out of it. That's when my theory started to form.

So to finally get to the point. I believe that sleep paralysis is the mind is some how not synced with the body. The mind is awake and aware but the body isn't completely out of a sleep state causing sleep paralysis. So the next time you are aware of it starting kind of lean into it. Instead of doing your best to get out of it try staying in that state as long as you can. If it works and gets you out of paralysis would you mind posting something so I know if my theory worked."

454,Anyone experience sleep paralysis several times a day?,Sleepparalysis,20,"Of late (several weeks) i am experiencing horrifying bouts of sleep paralysis daily. When taking naps, at night right before my sleep and several times during the night. Each episode is horrible and i feel intense pain in my heart and sometimes i have seizures and my whole body shakes. Often times i have to be physically woken out of it. I am contemplating seeing a heart doctor, to see if i have heart problems even though i maintain strong physical exercise. I do have sleep apnea and i experience these episodes even when wearing CPAP. Its depressing and scary. If anyone has experienced this would love to hear, or if this is a heart condition on top of sleep apnea. thanks for your time."
455,Things weren’t right in this... dream...?,Sleepparalysis,0,"I’m typing this like literally 2 minutes after I finally woke up. But only snippets.

I only remember snippets of the dream because there were some moment when I feel like I’m on bed but couldn’t move at all so I don’t know if I was awake or not. 

First replay: unrecognisable strangers came to the house and tried stealing my photos from photo albums. I told that one dude but he was agitated but focused on achieving his goal of taking something. He’d even jammed the lock in the box so I couldn’t lock the jewellery case. I remembered trying to run out the house (my deceased grandmother’s house - she passed away in real life last month - I live in her house in real life paying the rents because she wanted me to stay there until I can stand on my two feet) and tried running for help but didn’t know where to get help. I called my grandad via mobile phone and he picked it up but it got muffled and I thought I saw a security guards building complex but strangely I ended up back in the same room. Empty. 

Second replay: I remember that room didn’t feel like my grandmothers house because of the arrangement of the room like windows and door. For some reason I looked outside and told the people who were there not to bring that woman into my room. The woman looked at me damn straight and came in and just started acting suspicious and a bit nasty.

Third replay: some strange dude that looked like some office guy took me to a very ominous apartment complex (I live inside a house in real life) the area was strange and I turned around told him I needed to leave. But he grimaced and pulled down his face and stared at me.

I thought I woke up but couldn’t open my eyes. I didn’t opened my eyes because of what was happening. I couldn’t lift my body and I swear that strange woman was moving me around in my blanket. I kept my eyes closed knowing that I was still asleep. This happened three times in a row. Strange and bizarre motions of my head in blanket becoming stretched up and pulled down on my pillow slowly again and my blanket moving on it’s own so I knew I wasn’t awake but I was in my bedroom. Couldn’t move my arms and it like limp and useless too like wake up bitch lol in my head.So fucking creepy because in real life I this three bedroom house by myself. So I had no where to run and hide or call for help. 

Weird ominous music in the background. Sounded like Timore’s revenge theme.

The moment I woke I heard a car speeding outside. I knew that I was finally awake. But my eyes were trying to drift me back to hell lol. But yes. It was fucking terrifying. She looked like the grudge girl or that long black-haired girl from the evil within."
456,"Is it just me, or do any of you experience physical pain during SP?",Sleepparalysis,17,"It's been awhile since I've had an episode ( I've developed strategies to prevent it ), but most of the time I'm in SP, I get jabbed somewhere random on the body and it hurts a lot. For example, my ribs, scapula, armpit, knuckles, or anywhere that feels vulnerable. twice my nuts, Once even in my bum. It's like someone took a metal rod and strongly pushes it into me. Then when I wake up, most of the time the pain is gone, but sometimes the pain still lingers and the spot feels sore. Okay, some of that sounded wrong, but I'm not joking.

Anyone else have a similar experience? And yes, I still get all the crazy sounds and visuals, though I get way less of that nowadays due to some strategies I use against it. It's just the pain that is very annoying.

I can't reach my back with my hand, especially while laying on my bed, so I'm 100% positive it's not my own fingers poking myself in random spots."
457,Me and my brother had the same thing appear in our sleep paralysis experiences,Sleepparalysis,28,"A couple years ago when me and my brother were still both young teens we slept in a bunk bed across the room from our closet and door. My brother experienced SP first when he woke up to lying on the bottom half. According to him a large black figure wearing black coat like robes came from the nook in between the bed and the wall adjacent to him and bent down to do who knows what. About a year later I would say I woke up in the same matter. This time I heard footsteps and couldn’t call out to my parents. Through the shadows cast by the remaining light of the night I saw a very tall figure, around 7 ft, with a large black coat and top hat bend under the top of the entrance to our room and walk towards the bed. I’ve experienced some other SP scenarios but what’s creepiest about this one is how me and my brother both had similar figures approach us in SP. I woke up in a cold sweat but was able to forget about it eventually with the constant things happening in my life. Is this just a mental image/dream produced by my brother telling me about his SP or is it just a coincidence?"
458,Tell me about your scariest or bazaar experiences.,Sleepparalysis,9,0
459,I thought I finally got the breakthrough but..,Sleepparalysis,16,"I'll try keep it at short as possible.

So I've been experiencing SP practically my whole life. I even remember my first ever SP and it was when I was 6. And I can't get normal untill someone wakes me up or else I'm stuck in the loop. I tried to study myself like what could be the reason of having my SP.

Could it be because of something I watch before sleeping, or something I eat, is it because I'm in stress, is it because I'm tired, is it because I'm sleeping alone? And I came to the conclusion that none of it had anything to do with my SP because my pattern was totally random. Sometimes I won't experience it for months, sometimes I'd do it four nights a week. No pattern.

I have read that on multiple places that all you have to do is ease yourself snd you'll be okay, but honestly it isn't as simple as it sounds. Then it became something I learnt to live with, years passed. When all of a sudden, one night something strange happened. I started having a sleep paralysis but automatically (and I actually felt) that my body eased itself and I suddenly woke up without any difficulties.

I thought god damn it! That is it. I finally cracked it. I can do it on my own now.

However I've had SP after that countless times but I was unable to get out of it on my own.

Any of you have any advice for me? Thank you in advance."
460,Generic 'is this SP?' post - also Q about lucid dreaming..,Sleepparalysis,1,"Lucid dreaming Q - I've had countless dreams (always nightmares) where I'm aware I'm asleep and that I need to wake up to save myself from whatever is hunting me in my dream. Sometimes I see myself through my own eyes and talk to myself in both first and second person. Other times I see myself in 3rd person(?) and I'm trying to alert me as the floating presence to wake up (like I am a camera and the other me is in the room trying to alert me the camera to wake us up), also talking to myself in 1st and 2nd person. Would this be considered lucid dreaming?. Or is it just a normal nightmare?. 

SP Q - Last night I had a strange experience that's kind of creeped me out. In the middle of the night I 'woke up' but was still asleep?. I can't describe it, but it was like I was halfway between conscious and sleep. I was on my stomach and my eyes were closed. I came to and remember thinking I was stuck and needed to wake my partner up to help me but couldn't move. My hand was on his leg and I was trying to squeeze his leg so he could help me wake up but it barely made my fingers twitch. I also tried to make noise but my mouth wouldn't open so made a couple of moans and remember feeling  exhausted by it so fell back to sleep. I didn't feel in any danger or feel like someone was here (that I can remember). Just that I was trapped in place and needed to wake my partner but couldn't."
461,Have you ever been able to hurt your sleep paralysis shadow?,Sleepparalysis,9,I had an episode of sleep paralysis where  I suddenly had something pointy in my grip (I had no idea how it got into my hand but magically was there after a few seconds) and was able to turn over and hit the sleep paralysis shadow (it was laying next to me). Then I was able to wake up. Feel like our brains are really weird but would welcome any beliefs and experiences about it.
462,Sleep paralysis is back 10 years later now that I have depression and anxiety,Sleepparalysis,3,"Hi all, I’m glad I found this sub.

I first experienced sleep paralysis when I was 17. It was sort of a “classic” episode, I could hear rushing sounds and what sounded like a series of guitar strings snapping. I felt a very real sense of absolute foreboding and fear, then when I tried to scream I realised that I couldn’t move or make a sound. Before I found out it was sleep paralysis I honestly thought that there had been a nuclear explosion because of all the loud, chaotic noises and the fact that I could see everything in my room yet I couldn’t move. I thought that there was a chemical attack or something. 

I described the episode to my Dad and he said it sounded like sleep paralysis and that he had also experienced it, starting at the same age. 

From then on I had episodes where I felt a sinister presence, weight pushing me down, all that stuff. It happened a lot at uni, especially if I was sleep deprived or had fallen asleep during the day. 

After uni it gradually wore off. At one point I even had a cat (RIP) who could sense when it was happening. She’d tap me or sit on me, just touch me in some way and I’d be brought out of it.

I haven’t had any attacks for about 10 years but since I’ve been signed off with depression and anxiety I’m getting it a lot. Usually just as I’m falling asleep (when I sleep that is, I’m really struggling with that at the moment). 

Afterwards or even sometimes before I have this weird almost floaty feeling, but it’s not a good floaty like you’re relaxing on a cloud. It’s hard to explain.

Aside from getting a hold on my anxiety and depression, which I’m trying to do, is there anything that I can do to minimise this occurring? I’m having so many problems with sleep and the sleep that I do get is often disturbed by SP and sometimes I can’t shake that sinister feeling that comes with it, even after I’m awake again.

So glad there’s a sub for this topic!"
463,I (23M) have had two sleep paralysis dreams in the past month and a half. I really need some advice please,Sleepparalysis,2,"
These dreams I’m not sure if they are full on sleep paralysis. From what I’ve researched though they are very close to what sleep paralysis feels like. The first one was me laying in bed and I nudged my fiancé awake and asked if she seen what was at the end of the bed and she sat up and was enveloped by this entity. This entity started leaving the room while looking me dead in the eyes. I couldn’t move or say anything. This thing was slowly closing the door and at the last second of the door almost closed I shot up and opened it then I woke up. The second one was a lot scarier which just happened two days ago. I was laying in bed again and couldn’t move and this different black entity was at the end of the bed looking right into my eyes. It’s hands start reaching for my face slowly, and I can’t close my eyes. Right when it’s hands are about to touch me I wake up. The feeling I can best describe. It is like when you are going up stairs, and the bottom of the stairs are dark and you feel like something is about to get you so you get up stairs kinda quick. It’s that feeling amplified a lot. I just wanted to know anyones opinion because I haven’t been able to talk to anyone that has had these kind of dreams. Feel free to ask any questions."
464,Is this sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,2,"I’ve never had anything like this ever. I woke up this morning to my dog barking so I let her outside and went back to sleep. As soon as I was just about to fall asleep, I’m already in a dream where I’m at the grocery store and I’m trying to grab my phone from my pocket, but I can’t move my arm at all. Then I suddenly wake up and still can’t move and I feel like I’m actually about to die because Im so disoriented."
465,Encountering SP in the later morning and afternoon when there's more light in the room seems to limit the tricks your brain can conjure. Can anyone else confirm or deny this?,Sleepparalysis,12,"I have a hypothesis about darkness and shadows and how they're used to manifest certain shapes and figures so commonly reported of in SP.

As a night owl, I usually sleep from 2 am to 10 am, and I only ever experience hypopompic SP, meaning the kind you encounter while waking up. Of the five times I've encountered SP in my life, only once did I see a shadow figure, and it was, true to form, in the dead of night. In all other occurrences since then it's been 50% light in my room at minimum, and I've either not seen anything at all (only felt things), or the hallucinations I do see are fully identifiable things, like a hand or something, not a shadow figure.

Has anyone here seen a shadow figure during an SP episode that wasn't at night? I think it's safe to assume our brains can conjure shadow figures easier in the dark, which is why they're so common, but I'm curious if anyone's brain is beast enough to actually conjure one in a well-lit room.

Share your experience! Thanks!"
466,How I Fixed My Sleep Paralysis,Sleepparalysis,18,"Hi guys, I just happened to stumble across this subreddit. I thought I would share my experience on the off-chance it could be beneficial for anyone here.

I struggled with sleep paralysis my whole life and only recently in the past four years has it been manageable. 

I learned that instead of panicking and fighting the paralysis, I could recognize what was happening, and let myself fall ""back"" asleep. Eventually I learned to lucid dream in these moments, and it has rarely been an issue since. This definitely wasn't a quick process, and I know the entire idea of calming down in the middle of sleep paralysis seems impossible. But if anyone else has tried this, let me know how it works for you."

I haven’t had it in quite a while though due to either sleeping next to my boyfriend or on the phone while I sleep. I’m not sure why it helps but it does. Last night I had it again, each time I would fall into it as I closed my eyes. You can always feel when it’s about to set it. I felt it and I kept being told “kill yourself”. I opened my eyes but couldn’t move or even squirm. I tried really hard and got a peep out. My boyfriend heard over the phone and quickly said my name, he never had to experience this with me before but he knows I’ve had it really bad. It was about 4 am. I tried again to go to sleep. I dreamt I was driving, until I was told to drive off the bridge and die.. killing the others in my car in the dream. I woke again and the same thing happened.

She nose dived into the water which appeared to be shallow, and she didn't come up to surface.  I decided to dive in after her but instead of going into the water, I shot up into the sky.  Looking down, I could see the landscape from a higher and higher vantage point.  I said, ""Alright, I guess it's time for lucid dreaming,"" as i placed my arms to the side, and crossed my eyes into the third eye tunnel.  

A demon began forming like the time-lapse of a painting, and moving like a cartoon.  It began speaking very dark sayings I don't quite remember in a weird voice.  I tried to wake up but couldn't so I started creating sounds so maybe my girlfriend laying next to me would hear so she could help me.  I finally fought my way out.

I went back to sleep 5 minutes later, and a new dream began to form.  Again I was fully aware I was dreaming.  There was a very nice black lady singing a really catchy song I've never heard before.  I remember part of the lyrics where she sang: ""If only you knew how I felt, you would understand.""  It was a very cool show, but the singer and the stage slowly began morphing into one single thing I can't quite explain, and the voice became muffled and unpleasant,  so i tried waking up again, to which I couldn't for about 1-2 minutes.  It always feels like my brain in straining during sleep paralysis. 

About an hour ago, I decided to go to sleep, and fell asleep quickly.  I kept partially escaping my body, like waking up, but dreaming in the same room.  Once I made it to the edge of the bed, but got sucked back into body, then I made it to the door, and got sucked back into body.  I remember looking around and seeing myself in 5-10 forms all around the room.  I became scared and tried to wake up, and again; sleep paralysis.

After about 10 minutes of staying awake, I fell back asleep, but again, was dreaming of the room, except everything was misplaced.   Things were floating all around the room, like books and pictures amongst other things I don't remember.  I felt very frustrated and tried to wake up again but couldn't.  I then began singing the lyrics of the song from the dream earlier: ""If you only knew how I felt, you would understand,"" and remember screaming the word, ""understand,"" hoping my girlfriend would help in waking me back into reality.

I am now awake writing this, hoping that I can just sleep normally."
472,Any way to have SP?,Sleepparalysis,11,"Hello guys, i want to know if there is any way to experience Sp, i never had experienced one so i;m pretty interested and excited to have one."
473,Hello and good morning. Who else has experienced “The Old Hag”?,Sleepparalysis,20,"I’m new to Reddit so this topic has probably been discussed before. Anyways, I was lying in bed with my partner trying to fall asleep, when all of a sudden I could feel the presence of a women at the bottom of my stairs. I brushed it off and ignored the feeling... then my partner gets up to go to the bathroom and as soon as he closes the door the old hag is on top of me that fast. It felt like she was trying to possess me, I could just remember trying to resist letting it happen. My fist where balled tight, I was shaking and my eyes were closed very tightly. And just like that she was gone. It took me a min to tell anyone because I was thinking well, maybe I had a seizure... never had one before but it’s possible, I did have a migraine at the time. Then why the strong feeling of this old lady at my stairs then on top of me.. I told a coworker and she stated that it could be a lady that my partner was cheating on me with, (don’t know if he was cheating at that time) and I just somehow felt her presence. 

I don’t know but has anyone else experienced this?"
474,How do you know you’re about to get sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,3,"Has anyone else got ‘warning signs’ that they’re about to get it? 


I usually experience sleep paralysis when I’m falling asleep and it’s directly linked to over sleeping. Naps are a nightmare, even though I love them. I’ve just come off a night shift and so I’m very tired but I’ve slept all day so I’m struggling to sleep without paralysis happening now.  


When I know it’s about to happen, I get a ringing in my ears and I feel almost dizzy? If I’m really tired I’ll just kinda ‘lean into it” and let it happen but when I’m a bit more alert I’ll fight it and sit up for a while. 


I’ve just tried to go to sleep and it’s happened almost 4 times. It’s such a pain because I’m exhausted. Sleep paralysis has become more of a nuisance than something I truly fear now, since I’ve been experiencing it fairly regularly for 10 years. But I still try to avoid it."
475,Unusual (for me) sleep paralysis twice this morning. Anyone else experience this?,Sleepparalysis,1,"I’ve experienced sleep paralysis twice before this morning. The first time it happened I was able to actually put myself back to sleep and then began lucid dreaming. The second time was terrifying, but I was able to make it go away because what was happening was so ridiculous I knew it wasn’t real (I was sleeping in a hammock while camping with a group and I was hallucinating a strange man screaming at me. I knew that if he was real, the group would have heard him and someone would have come to help, and that made him go away. I felt very lucky that that worked).

This morning, as I was in that sort of waking up, sort of still sleeping state, something happened twice that hasn’t happened to me before. Both times, my brain was awake, but I was not able to open my eyes, and I was completely paralyzed. In previous two sleep paralysis experiences I had been able to open my eyes but couldn’t move the rest of my body.

So this morning I’m paralyzed, with my eyes closed, but my brain is fully awake. The first occasion, I was able to sort of figure out what was going on and just tried to relax - telling myself that my body just needs some time to catch up with my brain. Nothing too scary. And that worked, I was able to move eventually. I actually fell back asleep but later woke up with the exact same thing happening - completely paralyzed, unable to open my eyes, but fully awake and able to comprehend what was going on. Again I just gave my body time to catch up with my mind and thought about happy things. I’m not sure how long it was in between my mind waking up and my body being able to move. It was very unnerving, although I didn’t feel like I had any issues breathing - maybe because I sleep on my side.

Has anyone else experienced this?"
476,I'm scared of having a sleep paralysis tonight. What do I do?,Sleepparalysis,25,"It's a disturbing feeling that i cant get out of my head, i've had a pretty bad day full of stress and ive watched some horror shit today. I'm scared of going to bed.

**What do I do now?**"
477,is this sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,1,"hi, I don’t know if this is sleep paralysis or just a really weird form of dreaming, basically I’ll be having a dream or sleeping and then I’ll realise that that is happening and I’ll try to wake up. This almost never works and it feels like I’m stuck between being awake and the dream and I can’t fully wake up, I’ll just have to wait until it’s over which is usually quite a long time. In the case of a dream the events of the dream will still be playing out but things will gradually get more distorted and my vision will go black in places until it’s eventually just the sound. I’ve tried forcefully waking up from these but it never works and is actually physically painful at times. I don’t see the typical figure in the corner of my room."
478,Heard a storm outside when there wasn't one. Weird episode,Sleepparalysis,9,"I usually have sleep paralysis everyday. I ALWAYS close my eyes. I've blinked a couple of times, saw a fuigre. But lord if I saw some weird enity looking at me, I'd DIE. Usually I feel something choking me or pushing me down sometimes stroking my hair or pulling it. Today I heard a LOUD storm and Rihannas 'bitch better have my money' playing in the background. Mind you I didn't have any music on. I felt a gentle stroke on my leg, a female voice whispering something. I hear her alot, I feel like she's telling me off but then again I feel like she isn't a threat and she never pushes me harshly she's quite gentle. Then we have the two thingies which seem to work together. I feel this small but powerful creature choke my ass and hold me down then I feel something tall pull my hair. Like bitch why?... Swear these demons are into bdsm cause man I'm not into this shite."
479,My dreams get corrupted by SP,Sleepparalysis,2,"Hi there.

Sleep paralysis was something of a myth for me until a couple of months ago, when I discussed it with a younger cousin of mine, who experiences it frequently. Starting from that night, I began having episodes of my own.

However, my episodes are a bit different. I would dream normally but, at some point, one of the characters present in my dream would suddenly do something creepy. For example, last night I dreamt of being at my old house, chilling with two of my friends. One of them went outside for some reason, and me and my best friend went to see what's going on. My other friend was close to the door, and when I called him to get in, he did. Here's when the ""corruption"" kicks in. My best friend says, all of a sudden on our way back to the couch, ""alright, now I'm going to kill you"", and gets this inhumane, devil-like smile on her face from one ear to the other, and my vision goes dark.

Now, I've experienced events like this for a couple of months now and I started getting tired of them so, recently if  this happens in one of my dreams I get aggressive towards this ""corruption"" and often try to attack it. That seems to stop the SP from being installed, waking me up with an anxiety feeling and some paranoia.

This was not always the case though. Back then when I had my first few episodes of ""dream corruption"" I would wake up with SP; but I didn't have any ""SP demon"". Instead, I saw my own family acting weird around me; my little brother sneaking up by the side of my bed with a creepy smile on his face, my girlfriend attacking me from behind when I ""stay up""  after what I think is the end of the SP, even my own parents staring intensely at me somewhere in the corner of my view. At times, I would even have three or four waves of SP one after another, believing it's finally over only to be caught again in one of those creepy scenes. It got to the point where I was afraid of  going to sleep because those experiences drained my energy and gave me serious panic attacks whenever someone acted even slightly weird irl. I do reality checks very often and try to get as tired as possible in order to have a peaceful night of sleep.

Has anyone else experienced stuff like this? How did you get past them?"
480,Sleep paralysis or lucid dreaming? Pls I need answers,Sleepparalysis,1,"Hi everyone, so let me tell you guys weird experiences I have had while sleeping. I’m not sure if it’s sleep paralysis or lucid dreaming because I don’t know how to distinguish them. My first encounter was super scary. I was about 17 when I woke up to my room looking very foggy and cold. There was like a really bright flash coming from my window (I have big windows and sleep across from it) As I tried getting up I noticed I was only able to move my head and chest around as if I was trying to wake up but I noticed my arms were pinned down and I couldn’t move them. As I was looking around my room I can see 6 feet away from me a black tall figure was standing in front of me it had like a veil like the ones nuns wear. I didn’t say anything I was just staring at it for a couple of seconds when I reacted and started shouting leave and fighting out of my own body but I couldn’t move. just my head and chest trying to get up but I couldn’t move my arms felt the force of them being pinned down. The next thing you know I wake up to the same position I saw when I was sleeping I quickly get up and look around my room and everything looked fine. I have had many of those same dreams but that one has by far been the scariest one. I sometimes can’t feel my body but I see things around myself, I sometimes hear sounds like ringing and other times i can see myself sleeping from a distance but quickly wake up. I’m no longer scared of when this happens anymore. I was at first but I just now had something really weird happen again. I was sleeping but I can hear music from far away getting closing when I feel weight on my right side of the bed like as if it’s laying really close to me I try talking to it but nothing comes out of my mouth and I can’t move. This is not as scary but still kind of makes me uncomfortable of going back to sleep as soon as I wake up. 
Can someone explain to me if this is sleep paralysis or lucid dreaming? It feels really real when these episodes happen."
481,My SP experience,Sleepparalysis,0,"Growing up I would have SP a lot (in some cases for days straight), but am now 21 years old and has been maybe five years since my last experience. This mornings one really freaked me out since it had been awhile.
I was ‘waking up’ and felt the bed rustling, which didn’t worry me because I thought my boyfriend was saying bye because he was getting ready for work at the time. My hair was moved and then I was kissed on the head, however when I opened my eyes no one was there. I was super confused and then realized I couldn’t move. I heard my boyfriend still in the bathroom which really made me freak out. The pressure on my body started to increase and I kept seeing the bed dip in certain spots. The room looked exactly the same from what I noticed and then a shadow thing darted towards me from the corner making the pressure on me even more - I’ve had SP before, but man this one was so vivid. I kept trying to call my boyfriend or move, I even tried to grab my phone which was next to me to actually call him. Eventually the pressure was so much, I just stopped fighting because it was no use. Then I actually woke up and ran to my boyfriend freaked out.
Guess I’ll go back to avoid sleeping on my back lol."
482,Children Laughing in the Backyard,Sleepparalysis,1,"So I  had experienced sleep paralysis for the first time in my life last night. It was triggered by sleeping on my back, and at first, I felt like I couldn't breathe. Like I was sleep fainting if you will. I knew my brain was oxygen deprived and it literally felt like I was dying and falling into a void. I've fainted twice in my waking life, and this was the same feeling; except I felt like I wasn't in control because I wasn't fully conscious. It all went black for a split second- and I awoke to my jaw tense and locked in place. I then realize I was immobilized, I tried calling out ""help"" to my boyfriend but to no avail. I've read about SP years ago and thought that I could go through life without ever having to experience this phenomenon- so I tried my best to avoid lurking shadow figures that would've haunted me forever by keeping my eyes shut. 

I was so grateful my boyfriend was sleeping next to me so nothing could crawl into bed with me. However; our bed is cornered and I was on that window sill corner that faces our backyard, which extends onto a lake. We hear actual human voices regularly by the lake, but this time I had heard children laughing and running around in our backyard. There was no speech or words, just laughter. This went on for my whole SP experience, and I realized that it must be audio hallucinations since I refused to open my eyes and there was no way children were in our backyard running amuck at 2AM! 

I tried moving my fingers and toes and managed to get my right hand moving. I shook my boyfriend for about 7-10 minutes to try to wake him up. Eventually, ""BABE HELP ME"" came out LOUD and in my normal voice and I could move again. I had escaped from this nightmare of purgatory and was greeted back to the land of the living with ""Go back to sleep, I've got work at 5am."""
483,Brute forcing myself out of SP,Sleepparalysis,12,"Wondering if anyone else does this or similar. So if I ever “wake up” in SP. Being unable to move, any small attempt at waking up doesn’t work for me. So what I do is a try as hard as possible to throw myself out of bed. If it doesn’t work I relax and try again a few seconds later. I don’t do this completely consciously as it’s partly a wild attempt to not have to see my SPD( which I may or may not see if I stay in SP too long.

tldr: if you have SP, see if brute forcing your way out works."
484,Sleep paralysis that turned into astral projecting?,Sleepparalysis,2,"So this literally JUST happened and I’m a bit freaked out by it. So I was falling back to sleep after waking up too early and I feel this pressure/deep vibration on my head which I know from past experience leads to sleep paralysis for me. After feeling the pressure on my head I then see myself dancing around my apartment. After watching for a short while I find myself back in bed in the position I fell asleep in. I then try to wake myself up by wiggling my toes & it starts working... 

BUT

I realize that I was waking myself up in the dream! I almost step out of my bed but I get scared and return to the sleeping position. Then all I see is black and a bunch of interesting looking faces just looking at me. They’re all floating around just looking... & then I began to hear a woman singing so I told myself to wake up & wiggled my toes really hard & I finally woke up. 

I have had sleep paralysis before where I see shadow figures or hear voices but I’ve never “woken up” in the dream if that makes sense."
485,SP without Demon,Sleepparalysis,2,I have experienced alot of SP but there is never a demon there is this normal?
486,The scariest experience I had in sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,9,"I woke up to the feeling of someone touching my back, I looked around the room I saw a shadow standing near my bed, I began to panic and tried to scream for help but my voice didn’t came out! 

After struggling a bit to try to move I finaly was able to do it, but it felt like I was actualy leaving my body, not knowing what to do I tryed to switch the lights in the room but they wouldn’t turn on! 

By doing this I noticed that I was still dreaming (once read that this is a way to know if your dreaming in lucid dreams). During this the shadowy figure was just standing there watching me all the time, sometimes moving. 

Then I tryed to look back at my body laying on the bed but somehow I couldn’t, somethnig was like holding my head not letting me look at it. I eventualy woke up.

I had other similar episodes but this was one of the scariest."
487,Just experienced SP for the first time and I’m scared it’s going to continue to happen,Sleepparalysis,5,"Sorry if my writing is a little off because I’m still coming down from the adrenaline.

It wasn’t as bad as the other stuff I’ve read on here but at the time I didn’t think it was SP and I thought I was dying.

This happened when I was falling
 Asleep, I didn’t really feel tired and was just laying there with my eye closed. After a short time I began to have incoherent thoughts running through my head and everything seemed to start flashing white really fast with my eyes stiles closed. I also began to feel a vibration through out my whole body, at this point I knew something was wrong and I tried to move but couldn’t. I tried to scream for help but no words would escape from my mouth. As a last resort all tried with all my strength to move and ended up only kicking out with my leg, but this is what ended the experience and I sat up confused on what happen. 

I then looked up “unable to move and talk
In bed.”

It came up with SP and now I’m here.

I’m just confused on why this happened, Ive had regular sleep and nothing out of the usual had changed. 

Will this happen again? Is there a way I can prevent it from happening again?"
488,Anyone have any luck with treating sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,6,"Hey everybody. 

I (25F) started experiencing sleep paralysis when I was 18. Hallucinations/dreams throughout were pretty rare, with the exception of a few instances where I hallucinated/dreamt that I’d gotten out of bed and started my day, only to find out an hour later that I was still in bed. 

Since the beginning of March, the frequency in which I experience sleep paralysis has gone from once every few months or a year to every single night and morning. Every single time I sleep, there is sleep paralysis. Just now, I woke from a bout of sleep paralysis during a nap, and am too agitated to go back to sleep. 

I’ve talked to my therapist about this, and am getting a referral to a psychologist tomorrow so that I can hopefully start some medication to help me out. I’ve read that SSRIs are prescribed to help treat sleep paralysis, which is fine by me, since I’ve been on SSRIs in the past and have been trying to get a new prescription for years to manage my anxiety. We’ll see how this goes. 

This subreddit is full of people’s accounts of their own sleep paralysis, but I’m wondering if there’s anyone still in here who have been successful in stopping/managing their sleep paralysis?"
489,Has this happened to anyone else.,Sleepparalysis,7,"So i have sleep paralysis every now and then. My girlfriend is aware of it and THANK GOD she is beside me when they occur and she knows if i start moaning and whisper ""help me"" she quickly shakes me and gets me awake enough to reposition myself (usually im laying face up on my back when they occur) and fall back asleep.

Here's my question if anyone else has experienced this

So unfortunately i was alone and i woke but was completely paralyzed from moving or waking myself. Then by my bedroom door i saw a dark shadow walk towards me. As soon as it was right beside me the shadow reached out and i could feel it (whatever it was) touching my leg and moving up towards my waist. Completely freaking me out that i could see this image and feel it touching me. I looked down and saw the sheets begin to move as i kept feeling its touch. It went on for what seemed like an eternity until someone in the house turned on a light and it woke me. I didn't move and could see the sheets were in fact moved off my leg and left side of my body and to this day continues to freak out my thoughts when thinking of the whole ordeal.

Has anyone else experienced this? Anyone want to comment on what this was, why it happened? Why me??!"
490,Felt so real,Sleepparalysis,2,"My first time I had sleep paralysis a couple years ago wasn’t so bad, I had this dream we’re I was trying to open my eyes and I had the hardest time doing so and it felt so real and then I woke up. A couple months later it happened to me again but this I went to go take my dogs out to pee and opened up the sliding doors and then I froze and couldn’t move for several minutes. My wife said I was making noises in my sleep and she then woke up me and I was breathing pretty hard. It freaked me out really bad and I couldn’t see what was around me. After I had those two episodes I haven’t really had anything like that since then."
491,"Intense sleep paralysis and nightmares, sudden onset",Sleepparalysis,1,"Hi guys!

So I very recently just started experiencing hallucinations or whatever they are called during my sleep paralysis episodes. I’m not new to sleep paralysis, but recently I’ve been seeing huge spiders crawling on my walls, and some tall, thin shadow figure hanging out in the corner of my room before he walks up to me and puts his hand over my mouth. 

I live alone, but have recently moved home due to being furloughed and wanting to be with family during the pandemic. I currently take 5mg of melatonin before bed, which I’ve been doing for about a year (these hallucinations started about a month ago, before I moved home but after I was furloughed). They are also accompanied with extremely graphic nightmares that are too lengthy to explain here, but could explain in a response to this post if necessary. 

Has anybody else experienced this increase of intensity with their sleep paralysis? And if so, what did you do to help stop them? It’s really messing with my sleep schedule. 

Thank you in advance for any help/insight!!"
492,Is it common to have SP 2 times within the same night??,Sleepparalysis,5,"I’ve only ever experienced SP once in my life, and it happened 2 times in the span of 20 minutes. I’m only assuming it happened because i had gone to bed at 5 AM and had to be up in half an hour so when i woke up i was still in that half conscious state. It was pretty terrible, because i had literally seen the aforementioned “sleep paralysis demon”, the same one both times. I was just curious if anyone else has had this happen to them."
493,my sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,1,"Majority of the time i just see my room or black but occasionally i hallucinate. A few months ago my sleep paralysis was at its worst. it occurred almost every night. The weirdest one was i thought i woke up to someone opening my door and i thought my dad and i had a full conversation. when i woke up i went downstairs and mentioned it and he told me he hadn’t even gone upstairs to the bedrooms. 

the scariest one was after rearranging my room so my bed faced the door, i was asleep on my back, my door was cracked and i saw two pairs of eyes through the crack starring. i watched then they eyes opened the door and it was two people in full fur suits holding knives. the one in the front cocked it’s head and began to walk towards me and i woke up in a scream

last scary one i was swimming in an ocean, struggling until i saw a rock, i made my way to it and as i reached for it the water rose up and only my nose and mouth were above the water, then the sleep paralysis hit and i began to panic and eventually woke up. 

I’ve learned to live with my sleep paralysis but i am curious if anybody else had had similar experiences"
494,Sleep paralysis or paranormal?,Sleepparalysis,3,"The girl by the door:
This experience may possibly have been sleep paralysis. I’m not certain why but I was sleeping next to my mum this evening on the left hand side. I guess I always felt uneasy in the rental. Anyway, on this evening, I was fast asleep and had an unusual dream. In my dream the bedroom door was open and standing in the dark of the hallway was a girl with dark shoulder length hair and a white dress. The girl met my gaze and stared at me with an expressionless face. She took a step towards the bedroom door and as she took a step, ended back where she started. Imagine a scene replaying of a person walking towards you but for that scene to start over but each replay the person gets closer. I was paralysed with fear and could only watch as each time she took a step, she’d end up back where she started. With each step, she got closer to the bedroom. This continued until she was in the room and then her movement changed. She started to move towards me, and she appeared to be darting back and forward, frantically inching closer to me. Her expression changed with her eyes wide as she stood beside me. She glared at me and abruptly grabbed me. I woke up. It was a dream. I looked over the bedroom door in relief. It was closed. But not too soon after, the door opens and the girl is there again, there in the hallway. She immediately starts darting back and forward and lunges at me. I wake up. Look at the door, this time she’s in the room already, darts straight towards me and lunges at me again. Wake up and straight away she darts and lunges at me. This happens about 6 times, each time more closer, more frantically and more aggressively. The last time I wake up for real, in the sat up position as if I was grabbed and woke up during the attack. My breathing was heavy, my mum who woke up said I was having a nightmare."
495,Was this SP?,Sleepparalysis,1,"I have a memory from my childhood when I was probably about 4-5 years of age, am 20 now. I remember one night sleeping at my grandpas house when I was a lot younger (4-5) and I remember one night waking up in the same bed in the same room I went to sleep in but I couldn’t move and then all of a sudden I started floating out of my body and as I was floating out of my body I turned 180 degrees (as I was floating out of my body I was facing the ceiling ascending towards the ceiling but then I flipped towards the bed but I wasn’t the one who moved me it just naturally happened like there was no gravity in the room) and as I did I saw my body laying in the bed sleeping and now when I think about it it was like my spirit left my body. After I saw myself I kept spinning but slowly as I started to ascend further to the ceiling and then I specifically remember it feeling as if I was becoming apart of the ceiling (similar to trip reports of Salvia where people say they feel they become inanimate objects) and then I remember opening my eyes and I was in my bed and it was late at night and I remember feeling cold, dissociated and very confused. I’ve never had this happen to me again and the closest thing I have experienced to this has been from DMT and other hallucinogens. Any thoughts??"
496,I don’t know if this is sleep paralysis but I’m pretty sure it is,Sleepparalysis,2,So sometimes I’ll wake up in the middle of the night unable to move. I fight my way out of usually and try to lay back down then all of a sudden I’m unable to move again. I’m not scared it’s just really weird and it happens a lot.
497,I always have the same sleep paralysis dream ?,Sleepparalysis,5,I always dream a black figure stood over my bed and I can’t move at all but this only ever lasts around 10 seconds
498,LF Help: My partner felt a similar presence to me when I woke up from an episode,Sleepparalysis,3,"Last night I had an episode and when I woke up I didn’t feel real and my partner could also feel a presence or weird energy within the room and we both especially her are completely freaked 
Last night I had a very strange episode I haven’t had one since like 10 years ago when I was younger and was held down in my bed by some weird thing that was clear as day. 
But anyway back to last night. I couldn’t sleep all night and the literal 10 minutes of sleep I got just as I woke up I couldn’t move I was trying so hard to make a sound so my partner could hear but I could only feel myself breathing heavier. I was laying on my stomach and I tried to roll over and with doing so I felt like my soul was being ripped from my body instead of my body moving and then I heard this massive scream as I felt my the non physical version of my head be slammed back into line with my physical head and I woke up. My partner felt my body and I apparently had scary big goosebumps, I was explaining to her that I genuinely don’t feel real like something is completely wrong with the space it was like a shitty recreation of it. Even her dogs were acting really strange as well one kept jumping as if it was startled and the other didn’t want to come up on the bed. 
She’s really concerned as she never experienced things like this for herself, she has a lot of dreams but none that ever leave her worried about anything where as me on the other hand I rarely ever have them and when I do they are extremely violent. 
I told her I would look around and find stuff out so if there’s anyone with any knowledge or knows of somewhere they can point me to it would be greatly appreciated. 
Also sorry for the long post x"
499,Weird sounds,Sleepparalysis,3,"Hey guys, it’s late so I’m going to keep it short. I listen to a lot of heavy music and love horror. I’ve had several occurrences of what I know to be sleep paralysis, although I doubted it at first. I’ll tell those stories if you’re at all interested at all in the comments. But lately I’ve been hearing very faint voices and maybe what sounds like breathing. But the part that really gets me, is it almost sounds like it’s coming from my pillow sometimes. This past week I’ve been waking up very abruptly and with a beating chest. I cannot hear my neighbors as loud as this, and I even hear scratching or doors closing when I know my roommate is asleep. I sound crazy but it’s making it hard for me to sleep. Was hoping someone else has had this happen. Thanks for reading."
500,Sleep paralysis suddenly stopped?,Sleepparalysis,4,"I used to live in this house that was abandoned before, my dad had bought it and rebuilt it. I started to get sleep paralysis every night though, sometimes i would wake up on the couch or on my bed, i was sleeping in a different spot. Every time i'd get a sleep paralysis there was a shadow always standing in front of me, it always gave me negative energy, it got so bad that i stopped sleeping completely that i would pull all nighters and only get a blink of sleep once the sun started to rise.

But the dreams i would have before the sleep paralysis would always be something related to the future or sinister dreams. I would often wake up with scratches on my legs or red marks, the ones where if someone grabbed you too hard it would leave a red mark, on my body sometimes.

I moved from that house since then and the sleep paralysis have stopped, but every time I think about it or talk about it I get nightmares.

 I'm not sure what was in that house or who but it changed a lot of things for me."
501,Carol Anne...,Sleepparalysis,0,"So, I have no idea how long I was asleep for...
 I crack an eye open bc i hear this weird loud screeching sound..(So, I thought...still not sure)
 I see the TV is on but it looks black?! ( I fell asleep to This show called Community) I'm thinking another episode is about to come on... Nope nothing...
 I try to reach for the remote.....

I CAN'T MOVE...(o snap, is this what I think it is?)
Okay... let me try and get up....(crap..., still nothing.. wtheck) 
I have my cell in my hand. I try to move my arm so I can knock my phone up against the head board... (still  can not move. This time feels different bc my ears are ringing and I have a headache from that noise)....

So, I close my eyes... i open them again and sure enough I see this small round figure (dark shadow on my chest. No eyes no face. Sitting on top of me. In my head I am cussing this thang out...lol)

Dang.... why is my breathing shallow?! (This time is different) 
I close my eyes again. Take a deep breath. Tell myself I am dreaming and this is sleep paralysis..

As soon as i come too, I open my eyes and sit straight up, jump out the bed stumble around the room turn off the TV go to our son's room to check on them. I check on my hubby stumbling down the steps. Heart beating fast and hard.
Go to the bathroom to fall of the seat....( i laugh and cry and the same time...) 

Once I finish, I sit back on the bed and look around the room. Tell myself that was a wild ride..... 
This one was extremely intense to the point i never went back to sleep....

It gave me that Poltergeist type of vibe. I was terrified of that movie as a kid...

I was waiting to see that lady that always called out for Carole Anne!!"
502,Short story,Sleepparalysis,0,"So it was about 2AM and i was watching YouTube (I am a Over nighter).When I felt like I was tired, I slept.At around 3AM (I think that was the time because usually that's the devil's hour (correct me if I am wrong)) I woke up and realized I was facing my house ceiling (I usually sleep on my side) and couldn't move but suddenly I felt like something was picking me up but I couldn't feel the thing (Like when a Person gets possessed and rises up from their bed).I was laying in there helpless and paralyzed and that thing let go of me and I fell asleep with no nightmares. I told my dad and he said some demon possessed me.I now don't get sleep paralysis as often.Also I did not see any demon figures or shadows."
503,An experience I had in sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,4,"This is going to be short because I can't remember much from the event this happened 2 years ago 

 I think it was 3 or 4 am I was running on coffee and had I guess a caffeine crash my eyes got heavy and I couldn't move and I fell asleep somewhere throughout the night I woke up unable to move I heard my door open and heard my fathers voice say can you be a bit quiet and this distorted humanoid figure came into my room it walked up to me and just stared at me it had no facial features other than two white eyes it turned off my tv and said in a distorted voice I never heard before thanks when I was able to move my tv was actually off it can't turn its self off it never turned off by it's self again and it never did before other than that night"
504,Weird sound during sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,"So, I’ve only ever had one “serious” sleep paralysis in all my life, after that I learned to recognise it and it only happened again two or three times while having a nap during the afternoon but they were always manageable because I wasn’t deeply asleep and I snapped out of them almost immediately. 
The first one though was really rough. I was dreaming and (long story short) I recognised that It was a dream when the person I was talking to in the dream said something so unusual that it immediately “clicked” and in an instant I realised that it wasn’t real, and I woke up immediately. Of course, as sleep paralysis goes, I couldn’t move, not a muscle, nothing, I don’t even remember if my eyes were closed or not. I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary and I don’t remember how long I spent thinking about how I was probably having a stroke or some shit like that. I tried talking, screaming, moving my fingers and, of course, nothing worked. So I slowly started “accepting” that whatever was happening wasn’t gonna miraculously change because of me panicking so I started calming down. THAT’S when I realised that I was literally not hearing what was around me, It was SO MUFFLED like I was trapped deep inside my mind and couldn’t quite reach out of it, it felt like being underwater, and till this day I still remember how awful it was, not only it was muffled but also there was this constant ringing in my ear that was SO SO LOUD and let me be clear I never suffered of tinnitus nor do I suffer from it now. After I started calming down I eventually started hearing normally again and as I was regaining consciousness the feeling of being underwater eventually faded along with the ringing. Still to this day I remember vividly how much it felt like I was trapped inside my head. As anyone experienced this?"
505,My first happen today.,Sleepparalysis,0,"So here is how it went:
My cat has been waking and keeping me up at 4am for the past 2 or 3 days, she did it again today. She usually sleeps with me but has decided to sleep alone downstairs but I still keep my door open for her to come in if she wants to.
I was really tired and today is my first entire day off work in a while so I kick her out of my room and close the door.

I lay there for maybe 15min before I fall back asleep in my left side. I’m having these vivid dreams but then I’m awoken by a rush of absolute and sudden energy pushing through me. I feel the energy go through my face, chest, stomach, all the way to my toes and fingers. It all happened in about 3 slow seconds and as it is pushing through, I’m being moved.

My body is on the left side of the bed, the right side has a body pillow, and I’m laying on the left side of my body. It went from completely on my side to almost laying on my back, my legs are still the same and I can’t move. I am awake. I am numb/emotionally feel nothing and remain calm like nothing is happening, as if not to give the energy a reaction to feed off of. I feel  my body moving but my eyes are closed. The bed is dipping in the middle like someone is there with me, the bed only creaks on the right side of the bed and it doesn’t stop until a large mass presence is in the bed.

Just as soon as I am almost laying on my back, the immediate reverse happens like someone hit rewind. I am slowly being pushed back on my side. The feeling of someone laying there is still in my mind and I’m trying to scream but I can’t breath or move my mouth. I can flutter my eyes open a little but I don’t want to, I want them to think I don’t notice what’s happening to me.
When I go back to my initial state I stay still for a second, waiting for the lump to get out of my bed but it isn’t so I jump out of bed and leave the room.

The entire encounter would have been short, I was only asleep for 20 minutes.
I would have preferred a different first experience but shit happens.

TL;DR: I was spooked and didn’t like it when the thing that came into bed with me pushed me on my back. In the end, I’m a lil bitch.

Pls share similarities or ideas, I’d like to know what you guys think!"
506,A reoccurring dream which seems like sleep paralysis but I’m not quite sure,Sleepparalysis,3,"Reoccuring Dream. Unsure of what it is. I think it’s sleep paralysis or some strange version of it.

I’ve been having this reoccurring dream. 

The dream: I wake up in my bed. My bedroom is all the same, but I can’t move but I can consciously think. However, my thoughts are primarily scary images and whenever they flash through my head, my pulse starts racing and I feel like my body is convulsing. I thought this was sleep paralysis, but the thing is that I can move my body but it just takes a lot of effort. I end up rolling out of bed but before I land, I suddenly am back in the bed and I still can’t move. This happens for a while until I actually wake up.

Any Thoughts?

 this also only happens during naps which are longer than like 30 minutes"
507,Housemate & I experience sp at same time,Sleepparalysis,2,"My housemate & I moved into a new house in September last year. Neither of us had ever experienced sp before living here, but since then we’ve both had it several times, often with quite similar experiences. The first time, a couple nights apart, we both experienced being stuck in our bedrooms with a figure touching our hair, unable to move or scream. We’ve both had it a few times since then in similar ways too. Then last night, we both experienced it during the same time at night. I was having a creepy, but normal dream, but it turned into me being in my bed, feeling like the person from my dream was now in my room, pushing my neck into the pillow & choking me. I woke up still feeling pain & pressure on my neck, and also my tv turned on randomly as I woke up? Her experience at the same time was that she was falling asleep, but got stuck half way with awareness of her surroundings in her room but unable to wake up or open her eyes. Any ideas as to what’s going on ?!"
508,"Just had SP for first time in a couple of years, just thought I would list the triggers in case anyone finds it helpful. One trigger is I am unwell atm and unable to fall into a deep enough sleep (I have a head cold) and number two is I have been watching horror movies with my son which just seeped",Sleepparalysis,0,into the SP. I felt tje hairs on my back rise and so I told myself to wake up and I managed to wake up almost instantly. This is going to be a problem tonight without being able to fall into a deep sleep.
509,Sleep paralysis tall dark monkey creature anyone else seen this,Sleepparalysis,23,Had sleep paralysis and saw wat was like a half man monkey thing was crouched over and about 10 ft tall wondering if anyone had had same experience
510,My sleep paralysis has changed over the years,Sleepparalysis,2,"My sleep paralysis has changed over the years, and I don't think it's just that I've gotten better at dealing with it, it really feels like a completely different experience. 

&#x200B;

Before: I would ""wake up"" and realize that I can't move. I would try moving my arm, my finger, anything, and I would push and push and it would feel like I could almost move it but it never would move. It kind of felt like when you're underwater and you run out of air, so you start swimming to the surface, and you can see that the surface is getting closer and closer but you can never actually reach it, and your air is running out more and more. So my heart would start racing and I would be fighting with everything I have just to move my arm a little bit, and eventually I would ""break the surface"" and be able to move again. So I would wake up properly and be exhausted from fighting to move. My sleep paralysis was very consistently like this for \~10 years. The only inconsistent part is that sometimes I felt a presence in my room and sometimes I didn't.

&#x200B;

Now: I would ""wake up"" and feel completely normal. Let's say I wanted to move my leg and let it dangle off the side of my bed - I would hear the sound of the duvet rustling as I moved my leg, I would feel the carpet when my foot touched the floor, etc. The only weird thing is that when I looked down, my leg was still under the duvet. It didn't feel like I was straining to move, everything felt completely normal, it just felt like my eyes weren't in sync with the rest of my senses. And when I eventually woke up properly, it wasn't some huge climax where I was finally able to move again, it was just like gradually my eyes started to be able to see my movements again. My sleep paralysis has been very consistent like this for the past \~2-3 years. 

&#x200B;

Has anyone else had their sleep paralysis change? I think mine changed when I moved apartments, so maybe the new environment is why it's different now."
511,Lucid dream but also sleep paralysis? One of the most horrifying nights of my life.,Sleepparalysis,8,"Copied/reposted from myself on r/LucidDreaming

I [23F] have been lucid dreaming since I was like 9 or 10. For as long as I can remember I’ve been able to manipulate and realize that I’m dreaming. A year or so ago I read an article on the song “Weightless” by Marconi Union being the most hypnotizing song that it’s considered dangerous to drive to, and I was having trouble sleeping so I put the song on, and “fell asleep,” only to realize I was listening to this hypnotic song in full sleep paralysis, aware that I couldn’t move. That was the first time I experienced sleep paralysis.

Two nights ago I was staying at my “boyfriend’s” apartment and couldn’t sleep for some reason. Around 23:45 I started to “sleep” but my mind was still racing and I quickly realized I couldn’t move even if I tried. What felt like 20 minutes later, I snapped out of the paralysis but it was about 01:30. I couldn’t fall back asleep, so I laid on my back (normally the only way I can fall asleep quickly while being determined to lucid dream) and started counting to and from one hundred until I got distracted with creating peaceful visuals of where I wanted to dream, visualizing a beach.

This is where things got really terrifying. My eyes were closed and I knew I was dreaming, but I saw his bedroom exactly how it was, but when I looked at the ceiling I saw sand and an ocean at sunset. It was like the line between the wall and the ceiling was what was real versus a dream, respectively, but my body felt like it was experiencing the dream, like I heard the ocean. I looked up at the ceiling and I had started to walk into the ocean in first-person perspective, then after a few steps it became third-person and I watched myself walk into the ocean until I was completely submerged, and for some reason I couldn’t tell control myself not to. Because my body felt like it was in the dream I felt like I couldn’t breathe and was choking. I looked back down to “reality” and realized I couldn’t move my body to wake up. After what felt like forever I finally broke out of it, woke up (it was around 03:45), and sat up gasping for air (my lungs hurt so I had actually not been breathing) and making exasperated noises/soft screams, loud enough to wake up my boyfriend. I stayed up until noon yesterday then we took a nap and I was fine, but exhausted. When he woke up he asked, “Do you remember waking up having a panic attack?”

Has anyone else ever experienced this or something similar? I’ve been really freaked out by it since it happened."
512,Is this normal? Traumatic and Scary first timer.,Sleepparalysis,2,"This morning, at 5:58 am, I woke up lightly screaming and couldn’t move my body for 10 seconds. Before this happened, I remembered that while I was dreaming, I could see myself asleep in my room. Next thing you know, in my dream I was in this something point of view. I remembered that this something was walking down the hall to get to my room, and when it opened the door, I was watching myself, still asleep, and the this thing coming in to my room. This thing didn’t have no face or anything, it was just a shadowy figure. As I see that thing come in, I am now in my own perspective in where I wake up in my dream and see that thing leaning it’s head on my chest. One hand was covering my mouth while the other hand was touching my intimate parts. In that moment, I was terrified. I couldn’t move at all and i tried to scream but i couldn’t. It felt so surreal. I tried to calm myself down and then scream as loud as I can. After that, I woke up and look around my room if there was anything suspicious. There was nothing. To make it this situation more worse, I was home alone. I took some time to process what just happened and try to forget about it, but I was just wondering, is this sleep paralysis?"
513,Very concerned,Sleepparalysis,4,"Hello! I don’t personally have sleep paralysis, but my girlfriend does. She sees a tall slender man with a big head (kinda looks like Tor Johnson from Plan 9 from Outer Space with a huge smile wider than his head with bleeding gums and huge eyes). She says she best describes his facial features/details as the way those hyper realistic Sponge Bob close ups look actually. He lanks around her room and crawls on the ceiling till he finally ends up on her bed and staring at her face to face while sitting on her chest. When I first got with her she couldn’t even talk about it without having a full on break down on me. I finally talked her into sitting down with a friend of mine who has a similar dream demon (not sleep paralysis) that would run though his house and kill his family. From talking to both they had similar features. After talking, they both even felt comfortable enough to even draw them. It was very cathartic for the both of them. While she still had sleep paralysis, she actually did not see the “demon” for a very long time. We have been going through a very stressful time as of recent, and she’s started seeing him again. We knew he wasn’t gone forever, but was thankful that she had at least a long stretch without having to deal with him. The problem is that the other day, while driving, in the day time, she glanced in her rear view mirror and saw him plain as day sitting in her backseat. She swerved off the road (very dangerous and is the biggest concern), and glanced back and he was gone. This apparently happen a week or two ago and she is just now telling me. It has me/her very scared and would like to know if anyone on here has experienced this? I have her permission to post this by the way. She is also curious because we have not been able to find ANYTHING online where someone has experienced this. We also do not believe that “Curly” is real, before I get those comments."
514,Falling asleep,Sleepparalysis,1,"One thing I’ve noticed that usually happens when I get SP is that it feels like I fall asleep too fast. 

The last thing I’ll remember is looking at my phone at 10:04 for example and then the episode happens and feels like it’s been hours but when I finally get out of it the time is only 10:10 and I feel like I’ve lived through 3 hours. 

Has anyone else felt this?"
515,Sleep Paralysis Story,Sleepparalysis,3,"So it started yesterday, when I watched the tapes of Annaliese Michel’s exorcism. If you Google it, it’ll come up, but fair warning, these tapes are extremely frightening. So yesterday night, as I tried to go to sleep, I couldn’t, and I felt like I had a weight on my chest. I was sweating a lot, I was creeped out by the tapes I had watched earlier, and it was a horrible experience. I could not sleep until 2 AM, and I usually get sleepy at around 10 or 11. Thoughts on this? How do I overcome my fear of ghosts and demons and get a good night’s sleep?

Update: When I went to bed yesterday, I was uneasy and then when I put on the comforter I started sweating and it was really hot. But then, I remembered that there’s not a chance in hell that ghosts or demons are real and I managed to get a nice sleep. It also helped that I watched Harry Potter just before going to sleep. :)"
516,"Have you ever felt a hand tap you on the shoulder from behind while in bed, knowing there's no room for anyone to lay there?",Sleepparalysis,0,"Rhetorical, mostly.

I get SP episodes a half dozen times a year, and they're usually fleeting, five seconds or so. But 9/10 times, it's not visual for me, it's touch. This one is a favorite of my mind. I sleep on my side, away from the wall, and my bed is a college twin. There's no room for another person unless I'm at the bed's edge, which is not how I regularly sleep, of course.

Three or four quick taps from a finger. Rarely, I'm able to move my eyes or head enough to see the space over my side, and I'll feel my hand clasp against whatever hand was tapping me. Of course, that feeling of clasping hands is detached from wherever my actual hands are.

That's when the hallucination ends, I fully wake up and my body surges with hot adrenaline in a delayed response to existential fear. 

This is the fourth time I've had almost this exact hallucination. I'm more fascinated by SP than I am freaked out, but it's still off-putting. Got something to tell friends at work, today.

I have trouble falling asleep and shaking groginess due to insomnia, so that adrenaline rush from fear actually helps get me up. xD Maybe my tapping dream demon is doing me a solid."
517,Drone at the end of my bed,Sleepparalysis,1,"I’m in the military so it’s 2 people per small room. Myself and my roommate have our shelves set up in between our beds to act as a privacy wall. There is a very small walk way from his side of the room to mine. Almost every night shortly after falling asleep I wake up in sort of a panic and for a few seconds to even minutes i see a drone type object floating in the walk way next to the shelves at the foot of my bed. I always just stare at it and it feels like it is starting right back at me but as soon as I gather myself and move ever so slightly, it’s gone. I’ve had 2 different roommates and neither of them have seen or dealt with anything similar to this. I always have trouble falling asleep after this so I have many restless nights. Has anyone else ever experienced this? Maybe I’m just still in a dream state but it’s beginning to hinder my work ethic."
518,Been having stressful and subtlety disturbing dreams the past three days (including SP),Sleepparalysis,1,"Nothing that is cartoonishly horrific/ horror movie tier but subtlety disturbing and just stressful I'll sum it up in three days and one of the days included a brief sp experience.


Day 1. 
- was relaxing in a resort that suddenly turned into a battlefield and I was now fighting in a ww1 style arena, very stressful experience and my teamates looked slightly deformed, kinda like bad video game rendering and I kept getting quickscoped by dudes in top hats and Victorian era clothing. (I could respawn like a videogame). Felt like I did not get a good rest when I woke up

Stress factor: high,  Disturbing factor: Mild,  Interest factor: Low


Day 2.
- was participating in a complicated war game against demon forces in some oasis in the desert. The fighting was happening using telepathy and recon tactics. They took the form of robotic Teletubbies. From what I remember it was mainly at a stalemate until towards the end of the dream everything thing started glitching, like the matrix was being broken and I was started to wake up, but I felt paralysed. Opened my eyes to discover I'm in SP so I quickly tightly shut my eyes and instinctively moved my fingers and toes, suddenly I was out of the paralysis after a few seconds. 

Stress factor : moderate Disturbing factor: high Interest factor : mild


Day 3. 

- had a dream that me and my family time traveled to a dystopian futuristic city and were stuck there, was quite fascinating and TV show worthy, at one point I was in a hotel room with my family and they started morphing from teenagers to old people as a side effect of time travel, so I just left the room and noped out. Decided to pick up some girls at futuristic Starbucks and made out with one in the moon light which was pretty nice tbh. There were disturbing and scary parts of the dream though
• run into a child molesting ring and saw some disturbing stuff, it had a happy ending because I called my deceased brother and we both fought the child molester and rescued the children 
• the dream took place over several days so I could sleep in the dream, one time I caught camera footage of my entire family watching me sleep at what looked like a futuristic operating table, and they were observing me twitch my fingers and toes?  

Stress factor: mild, Disturbing factor: moderate Interesting factor: high"
519,A witch messing with my brother,Sleepparalysis,9,"Years ago, my brother woke up to an annoying noise, he described it like a rat or something scratching the surface of the wall, he claims to have never been fearful as he stood up repeatedly to yell ""fuck off, you are annoying"", and then feel a sudden sharp pain in his arms. Lights on, he realizes his forearms are scratched in an irregular form, he goes WTF, does not make anything of it then goes back to sleep. It happens a few more times before he tells us, it makes my mother think it is a witch since it checks with the Colombian folklore depiction of a witch (Shady creatures lurking through the night, they fall in love with people, then proceed to take their vitality, making them look unhealthy and unrest and only leaving scratches and bruises behind) so she gets rid of the mattress (some relative had used it and she claimed he was doing witchcraft) and puts crossed scissors under his bed which is what the tradition tells to do. Of course neither me nor my brother believe that stuff, it never happened again.

He has had another episodes, but has never been hurt again.

When this happens to him he does not realize he is asleep, he wakes up, sees the room exactly as it is in real life and stuff happens, once he saw a screaming goblin hit the window of his bedroom really hard as if it was breaking in, he even steps up and turns the light on sees the hour and goes back to sleep, only then he wakes up and realizes that it was all a dream because the real door had no knob and in the dream it had, and the light switch was not on the wall he reached it a minute later, he looks at the hour, and is the exact hour he saw on the dream. 

Does anyone have a possible explanation for the scratching?

Has it happened to you or somebody you know?"
520,"So, I've had 3 experiences. At this point, I'm just wondering if there's been some bad juju/spirit following me around lol",Sleepparalysis,5,"So, I've had 3 experiences. At this point, I'm just wondering if there's been some bad juju/spirit following me around lol.

First was a few years ago, sleeping in my brother's room. I was alone at home, so I left the door open, with the rest of the house lights off except for the bedroom. I was sleeping in a really straight position, with the blanket tucked snugly around me. I fell asleep like that. So I ""woke up""/opened my eyes and saw someone (a dude) ahead of me/by the foot of the bed where my brother's dresser was and was tinkling around his stuff on top of the dresser. Then he turned around when he noticed that I was awake and smiled kinda creepily. Then he walked closer and sat on top of my chest-belly area and I remembered I couldn't breathe or move at all. He was smiling the whole time. It lasted from a few seconds to a few minutes, I couldn't tell. And then I moved my head to the side, right where I was looking at the dark hallway outside of my brother's room and woke up. I was in the exact same position as I was in, in my sleep.

That was the first time I've ever had something like that ever happen to me. Now, a few months later, I did find out that the house, especially that room was kinda haunted. So, maybe that was that? But then more than a year or so later, I moved to an apartment in a different city that's very well known for ghost tours and such.

It was around 11am, almost 12 noon, when I would usually wake up. Pretty straightforward. Someone just crawled on my bed, a girl in white with short hair but long bangs covering her eyes, and sat on my stomach and started choking me (she seemed angry). I really couldn't breathe then. I was clawing at my throat when I woke up after I moved my head, and for a split second, the girl was still on top of me before disappearing. I actually went back to sleep after that happened lol. So I wasn't really scared. I told this story to my roommates and they told me that they've seen/experienced something like this, but not as bad as mine.

Third experience is very recent. Moved to a new place because COVID. It was empty so my bedroom is pretty bare except for a bed and night stand. It's a big room. I was half awake? I don't know, but I felt pretty conscious in my ""dream"". In it, there was another bed next to mine in the bedroom that looked slept in and a chair in the corner. Someone I know was sitting, very stiffly, on the corner. I said sorry for waking up late but she just smiled and nodded. I was still lying down, curled on my side, when I ""woke up"", but I realized again that I was still in a dream. The other bed and chair was gone, but for some reason, I knew that the other person was something else. So I told it to ""leave me alone, it was my room now"". And I could just feel this really angry aura (that's the best I could describe the feeling) and someone sitting on the space behind me on the bed. I literally felt the bed dip. And it was suddenly so cold and chilly and I felt so heavy, I couldn't breathe. I told it to go away again, but it wouldn't budge although it didn't seem so angry anymore. So I forced myself to really wake up and shot up out of bed really fast. It was the scariest experience compared to the other two.

I felt sick right after. Even hours later, I still felt sick. Like I wanted to throw up.

So yeah, wondering if I have a spirit following me around (because then it has followed me to 2 different countries and states lmao). But man, even years later, I still remember the last 2 ones vividly.

Sorry for the format, or something. Very new here.

Edit: added some details..."
521,For the first time i was not scared in my SP and there was a cat - what happened?,Sleepparalysis,0,"Last night I woke up after 4 hours of sleep which is really uncommom for me. I need my 8 or I am zombie and i never wake up in the middle of sleeping - not even to pee or drink.
After a snack and tv i went back to sleep when the paralysis happen - but it was quite different than anything i have experienced before. I usually cant move, cant scream and feel this horrible terror. But tonight, I felt... ready when it happened. 
I was fighting against it, but not scared - I remember my muscles tense, trying to overcome stillness and i moved a little bit, but it was really tiring. I felt hopeless, trapped. I tried to scream and I did achieve to make a sound - I thought that I do not want to wake up my boyfriend lying next to me, as if i wanted to resolve it on my own, not to alarm him. But he was still asleep so I knew it is still a dream.
Then I looked up and there it was - white cat was sitting next to my head. I was not scared, just surprised - it felt like it is supposed to be there.
Even more bizarre - right after it i did not wake up, sp changed to the dream where i was trying to solve what just happened - if the cat was guide or if it meant there was a ghost etc - just trying to understand it in another dream. But nothing came out of it, I just woke up really tired.
I am still quite puzzled by it, I usually know why I have dreams/sp, i know what i am trying to process in a dream - but not now. i have a feeling that it really meant something but cant wrap my head around it.
I had an animal in my sp before, it was a dog but i knew he was there to protect me. This white cat was something entirely different. 
Does anybody have an experience with it?
What could be the trigger for my subconcsious?"
522,Did I “almost” have sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,4,"I recently watched a YouTube video about sleep paralysis and I remembered an experience I had a few months back. I never had sleep paralysis in my life and I wonder if this was my closest to have it? So I woke up in the middle of the night because I thought I heard something in my room. 

I opened my eyes and to my surprise, I couldn’t stand up. I didn’t freak out initially for some reason, I was in a very relaxed state. I tried moving again and again and I still couldn’t. I could easily move my fingers tho. Then it hit me: “am I having sleep paralysis??!!”

And I instantly stood up. The whole thing lasted for like 15 seconds. I didn’t have any hallucinations. Was this sleep paralysis? Can you actually have such a short sleep paralysis without any hallucinations?"
523,It felt like a seizure.,Sleepparalysis,4,"This is my first post here and it's about the first time, according to my physician, that I experienced sleep paralysis. I was hoping to post it here to see if there were any symbolic similarities that I share with others and hopefully get a better understanding of what happened. 
Sorry in advance, it's going to be a long post. 
It happened about two weeks ago. I have been trying to meditate nightly to strengthen my spirituality and help with my anxiety, and when I do I try to picture myself walking through the forest (goofy, but it helps). This night was the same as any other, however as I was walking through the forest everything became very dark to the point where I couldn't see. It felt like I was drifting off, but my mind was still very active and I knew I was still awake. In the darkness I started to hear dripping water, and my feet felt very cold and wet. As I was wandering through the darkness I found a bright red door, and the only focus I had was to open it and find what's on the other side. It scared me because I'm a strong believer of the paranormal and I've always known a door meant a gateway, and gateways can lead to anything. When I walked through the door I was right back in my bed, in the same position I was meditating in. I could see everything around me, but I know for a fact my eyes were closed. My entire body started to twitch and shake uncontrollably. I seriously thought I was having a seizure. I tried to look around my room, but was stuck in just one view. There were large grey figures in my room, and they didn't look human. There was one crawling along my floor, a few standing over me, and one lying on the ceiling. It scared the hell out of me. I felt like I was fighting to wake up, but no matter what I could not get my eyes to open. The only thing that woke me up was my boyfriend next to me had started to stir, probably because my body was moving like a fish out of water. When I sat up I had to spend several minutes trying to catch my breath and I couldn't stop crying. My entire body hurt for days after it happened, like I just ran a marathon. I told my boyfriend what happened, and he thought it was best to talk with my doctor. I've had the hardest time with sleeping since then because I'm scared of what I might see if it happens again. I'm even worried about meditating. My doc switched around some of my medicine to see if that would help, but I don't know if that will work or not. 
Does anyone have advice for how to move past it, or not be afraid when it happens? 
If you made it through this post, thank you for reading it. I appreciate any help I can get."
524,Weird sleep paralysis(?) incident,Sleepparalysis,1,"The other night I had something weird happen to me. I’m a diagnosed insomniac so I wake up quite frequently in the night when I do sleep. Usually waking up constantly in the night triggers sleep paralysis for me. This night in particular though I kept waking up with the feeling of the area under my right boob being tickled. It was extremely uncomfortable and almost painful from the discomfort. I actually was able to move my body perfectly fine, it was just this sensation that wouldn’t go away. I’ve been “tickled” in my SP before and it was this same feeling only I was mobile. I even thought at one point that I should try to shake off the feeling ASAP, otherwise I’m guaranteed to wake up in SP the next time I woke up. I ended up just staying awake the rest of the night because I was too afraid of either waking up paralyzed or waking up being tickled, or even worse both. Has anyone else had an experience like this before? I figured someone who faces sleep paralysis often might have a similar story. Not sure but being tickled in my sleep seems to have been a fear instilled in my head the minute I had reoccurring nightmares as a child being tickled by my toys that suddenly started moving on their own. Not sure what to do about it either"
525,"The weirdest thing, still terrified to this day.",Sleepparalysis,10,"Ever since I was a child I have always had a fear of aliens (stupid I know) I think this was caused by staying up late to watch episodes of the X-files when I was younger. Anyway I have occasionally woke up to sleep paralysis and could hear the TV or radio playing that was still turned on when I fell asleep, occasionally sense something in the room, nothing too bad. This one night I woke up in a sleep paralysis and I swear this small goblin looking creature crawled up on top of me knowing how terrified I was and whispered into my ear “I’m an alien” in a sinister tone, almost as if it knew this was a fear of mine that I have told nobody else ever. 

This was either my mind playing tricks on me or this creature was aware, I could sense only evil intentions from it as it just sat on top of me close to my head. 

The house we lived in had a wooden floor that would make a noise only when stepped on at a specific point and I would occasionally hear this late at night, also a taxi driver once told me that a ghost pushed his friend down the stairs one night in that house years ago but I assumed he was just joking, no idea if it’s true or related to this."
526,First time Sleep Paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,0,"I've read the noted post to stop posting ""Is this sleep paralysis"" but I feel my situation was unique and I'm not sure if it was a Psychotic episode or in fact Sleep Paralysis. For reference I have ADD, Severe Anxiety, Depression and likely hood of Bipolar Disorder.

Huge Paragraphs ahead.

I generally have trouble sleeping and can sometimes wake up multiple times through out the night, 'usually' I'm still in a half state of dreaming and if I wanted to could wake up fully even while dreaming still, other times I properly wake with clear memory of the previous dream and I'm up for about 10 minutes before falling asleep again.

Last night however I woke up with a blank slate of mind and just kept my eyes closed trying to fall asleep again. Then I felt a presence and started hearing unintelligible voices (not whispering) in what would be the middle of my room and the presence felt unnatural and malicious, I then felt an odd strong sensation that went from my lower abdomen up to my chest and spread to my arms this is when the voice became louder.

The sensation faded then the voices stopped for 4 seconds I could then 'sense' the presence shift a bit closer I then hear my mothers voice where the presence was and I could 'sense' the presence shift closer with the voice of my mum moving with it and she was trying to coax me into opening my eyes and look at her and to reach out and hold her. I tried to move my arm in order to turn and face the other way because I knew it can't be real but I was feeling the sensation that I was lifting my arm, but I could really feel that it was in fact not moving, it was as if I had 2 arms but the fake one would lock back to where the real one was after a few seconds of trying to move it. This repeated a few times, meanwhile the voice is getting more persistent and changing slightly to something that kind of sounded like my mum but not really. And then with what took great strength I managed to somehow move my arm and turn around and put the covers over my head. I could sense the presence move closer and different voices of 3 other people 1 which was recognisable calling me to turn around. Then the sensation from my abdomen upwards happened again and the voice became unintelligible again before I then felt the presence move closer to me and I it then felt like it laid in the bed next to me, as in I could feel the bed weight shifted like some one got in. And a different voice to all the others was telling me to turn around and open my eyes to it.

I literally put my hands together and tried praying for my life and after a while I reached for my lamp and turned it on keeping my eyes closed and after 4 seconds I opened them to turn around and of course nothing was there. but I could still sense the presence on my bed, although not as strongly until I left my room. This was the single most terrifying moment of my life, and I work security and have had to restrain and fight murderers with a high likely hood of me dying.

This seemed like it could be sleep paralysis but I'm not sure because I could move, even if it took a lot of effort. Sorry for the huge paragraph also. Delete if not allowed."
527,Crawling,Sleepparalysis,4,"I used to get sleep paralysis a hell of a lot more than I do now but one of the weirdest was if I fell asleep on my front I would feel something slowly creep up my legs then back until it got to my neck. I obviously couldn't see it but I could hear sort of whispering, I just wondered if anyone else experienced this kind of SP?"
528,Paralysis by a shape-shifting entity,Sleepparalysis,6,"I just wanted to share my SP experience about a night ago.First off,  I've (over 30 F) only had a paralysis twice in my life: partial paralysis of an unknown nature over a year ago, and a full paralysis just recently.

I'm a rational person, majoring in psychology in the past, and I don't believe in paranormal. I do recall eating before going to bed, and I've read somewhere there might be a connection between getting late night snacks and the paralyzing nightmare.

It started in a very innocent way, but rapidly took a real dark turn. So here goes:

I see my mother's- in-law cute little white dog across the bed (the dog that me and my husband often like to play with). I look at the puppy and tell him that ""I love him"". The dog stares back at me and then slowly starts shape shifting into a white cat. The white cat is replying back to me in a rhetorical question: ""You love me? "" - with a sinister, sceptical, malicious undertone.Then the cat is shape- shifting into a huge, tall amorphous demonic creature, that I cannot see, but I feel its evil intentions, I see its enormous growing white form engulfing me, and I'm feeling ""it"" with my whole body, and that's when the complete paralysis consumes my body. 

I'm trying to get away from it, already half awake, but cannot move, and I feel the deep guttural buzzing or humming vibrations, like during the earthquake, it's pressing against my body and immobilizing the ending of my nerves and muscles. The paralysis is pinning me to the bed mattress and electrocuting through my body. Unable to call for help, move, or utter a word, I'm absolutely horrified. Only after a few minutes it lets go of me and I manage to get free. It was the creepiest shit that I ever had to experience in my dream. That paralysis  part  is absolutely out of this world. It's got such a real unsettling feeling to it, it almost feels like a claustrophobia in the most intense form. Extremely disturbing.

My theory is that the corona virus quarantine resulted in a quiet unhealthy lifestyle- lack of exercise, late night eating, lack of activities, being stuck in the house etc. So this new adopted lifestyle is the only rational explanation I found for this noval ""sleep paralysis"" occurrence of mine.

However, there is something extremely unnatural in not having a control over your own body during the paralysis. It really feels like a ""foreign entity"" is constraining your body.That's why, in my opinion, people, experiencing SP since the dawn of time, used to connect it with the supernatural.I have done the research on the topic, read the historic files, the collective unexplained phenomena, including the mass deaths during the sleep. And after analyzing it, I decided to keep my mind open, because some facts and other people's documented experiences still cannot be rationalized and explained with the critical thinking.

""What we know is a drop, but what we don't know is an ocean..""( c)"
529,do you have any cool/positive/memorable sp experiences?,Sleepparalysis,5,"I used to get sleep paralysis every other day so I do know how terrifying it is, but this one time instead of a shadow person choking me I saw a huge glowing winged angel sitting on my chest illuminating my whole room. I didn’t even realize I couldn’t breathe or move at first bc I was just in awe. I felt so safe, then it faded away like normal. I’m not really religious but I was raised catholic so it definitely awoke certain feelings in me haha. I did keep having scary demon paralysis after that tho :\"
530,Sleep Paralysis at Work Story.,Sleepparalysis,0,"So I was in the back of the truck sleeping on my back. It was about an hour and half trip. When we arrived I was sleeping. The driver and passenger said, ""wer'e here you awake""?. Although I heard them say it out loud, I couldn't respond. I tryed to talk, but of course nothing came out.So the passenger hit me in the leg which I saw him do and saw him smiling. I was aware I had to get up but was stuck for a couple seconds, all the while I had full vision of what was happening around me. So when I got up and started to work, I asked my co worker in the passenger seat if my eyes were closed, and he said yeah you were out cold dude. I then told him that I heard everything and saw him hit me on the leg. Now when I told him he had a smile on his face, he got weirded out. Now the two guys I work with think I'm a freak. This was the first time I had sleep paralysis with a live audience, and saw everything happening with my eyes closed. I get sleep paralysis all the time but this one changed me a little bit."
531,Vibrating nightmare,Sleepparalysis,7,"So, Every once in a while I have this nightmares that consist of some combination of dark colors, sometimes they are more elaborate and feel like a dark (or in a low light environment) bleeding wall, but the more annoying thing about it is that I start feeling very uneasy and my body starts violently vibrating , and I say vibrating because it does not feel like shaking (like when shaking from cold), more like when you try to force your asleep leg to move. I try to sleep trough it but its gets worse and worse until I have to force myself to wake up. Then I fall asleep again and it keeps happening and it only stops when I go and sleep next to a member of my family.

This makes me wonder, 

Has anyone experienced the same?

Why a bleeding wall and nothing else?

Why the vibration?

Considering that it might be related to bad sleep habits, then why does it stop when I sleep next to someone else?"
532,My tips to control sp,Sleepparalysis,0,"My first step is trying to control your breath, I just breathe heavy since I have trouble breathing. Trying to have a consistent breathing rhythm is key to not freak out in sp. my second tip is trying to see if your finger or toes move, I can barely wiggle my toes and fingers but it’s a key to wake up from sp. if you lay on your back and get sp, try to lay on your side, you can’t due to sp but your brain will try and possibly wake you up. Another tip is just closing your eyes and move your eyes left and right continuously."
533,New guy looking for help...,Sleepparalysis,7,"I'm not new to SP but I am new to Reddit so I'm not sure if I'm in the right place. You could call me a ""social media novice"" as I mainly only go online for my news & current events, a little shopping and researching topics of interest. I found Reddit while looking into forums for other sufferers of SP and figured I'd give it a shot since Dr's & in person support groups haven't been much help. I'm really hoping someone in this venue might have some helpful advice for reducing how frequently my episodes of SP occur and maybe even some tips on alleviating their severity as well. It's gotten so bad recently I'm literally terrified to lay down at night and it's really starting to negatively impact every other aspect of my life. My wife says I have a tendency to be long winded and for over explaining myself but I'm literally begging anyone who might be reading this to please stick with me here.

Just to give everyone a little background on myself here. My SP first began in my mid-teens, along with my bouts of anxiety & depression. Friends would say I was just making it up when I'd ask if anything similar ever happened to them. My mom was scared I had a brain tumor or something when I described what was going on with me, which didn't do a whole lot for my anxiety. Our family Dr said he was pretty sure it was SP and referred us to a specialist but my family didn't have a lot of money and our state run insurance wouldn't cover it. I didn't get confirmation until I had decent insurance through my employer, years later.

The past 20+ years I've dealt with extended periods of several episodes every night or having no episodes at all and everything in between. The past few years I've experienced relatively infrequent episodes up until recently. Maybe once or twice a month, shortly after falling asleep or just before waking up I'd have a relatively mild instance but not much more. About 6 weeks ago, my wife & I had our offer accepted for our new home and my episodes became more frequent with increased severity. I'd hoped after everything was finalized and we'd moved in, everything would settle down a little. However my SP escalated to an extent I'd never previously experienced since it first started.

Despite the fact I've been dealing with SP most of my life, I still have trouble recognizing when it's happening. Once I do realize what's going on, I usually have little trouble relaxing and focusing on my breathing. Then I'll concentrate on moving whichever appendage is least restricted by the position I was asleep in until my entire body follows suit. If my wife's present when it happens, she'll help rouse me fully awake. Again this  would usually occur shortly after falling asleep or just before waking up. When it occurs right after falling asleep I usually fall right back asleep, which wasn't so easy when I was younger and not used to it. Rarely would I have back to back instances and never did I have more than two within the span of a few minutes but that's changed a great deal now.

Since moving in to our new home I now have multiple episodes, EVERY SINGLE NIGHT, right after falling asleep AND just before waking up! Even after recognizing what's happening, it's nearly impossible for me to focus on breathing effectively. I go into a full on panic, terrified I'll suffocate and unable to concentrate on moving a hand or foot in order to ""activate"" the rest of my body. Most times I end up flinging myself onto the floor upon regaining the ability to move. I haven't severely injured myself yet but I've hit my head on the nightstand and deeply bruised various parts of my body. I've had times where I'd have another episode of SP within a few minutes of falling back asleep after the first one but that was far from normal. Now having 3 or 4 instances within a few minutes of each other, one after another after another is an every night occurrence. From my own research, I know many sufferers of SP will sometimes have other symptoms besides what has been my usual experience. Some people see a dark figure in their peripheral vision, feeling as if they're being physical restrained or have something of very larger mass weighing on them down. Prior to my more recent episodes I'd never endured any of those things for myself. Now all of those symptoms manifest themselves during every instance of SP I have had over the past few weeks. I'm scared, I'm lost and at my wits end. 

I'm constantly angry and lash out multiple times a day at my wife who is trying her best to be supportive & caring. I work 2nd shift and I'm exhausted every moment of the day. It takes everything I have to make it through work each day and I've become even more antisocial than I already was. At this point I'm just not myself and I don't want to go through this anymore. Right now it's 3:00am and all I want is to lay down next to my wife and go to sleep but I'm absolutely terrified. What if I'm unable to maintain some sense of my faculties next time and I do actually suffocate? What if the next time I go hurtling out of bed I break my neck or fracture my skull? Right now it would help a whole lot for someone to tell me they've dealt with SP at a similar rate but they were able to get through it.

If anyone has had SP affect them to the same extent and were unable to do anything to make it easier I'd like to at least know you got through it. Even if you just had to deal with it until it was better one day, that would at least give me a little hope. Just knowing there's others who've been where I am and are still here would mean so much right now. I'm hoping someone can share something that's worked for them but I'd settle for just knowing this won't last forever. I honestly don't know how much more I can possibly endure. Without just a tiny ray of sunshine breaking through the clouds sometime soon I'm not sure what I'm going to do."
534,Is it sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,12,"Hi , I’m new here so apologies if i’ve not got the lingo/format etc correct.

So basically i’ve “thought” i’ve had sleep paralysis for years now. It started off with a recurring “dream” of a woman standing at the side of my bed and me screaming and then thinking i had woke up but then she’d be floating above me and repeat, repeat until I actually woke up.

Slowly things began to get less scary as I was able to tell myself “make it happy” or “you’re dreaming” and it would be over pretty quickly.

Tonight felt different.

Admittedly my sleeping schedule has been all over the place during lockdown & I had a busy day so went to bed around 9pm and was asleep probably before 10pm. 

In the dream I was lying in bed on my phone but could feel a “presence” so I looked up and I was floating above myself. I then switched places with the me in the bed, to floating me. The me in the bed then opened her mouth in an impossibly wide, terrifying manner and spewed out black liquid whilst making a screeching sound. Floating me then morphed back into bed me. So I tried to scream myself awake. I thought I was awake but then I looked over at my mirror and it was wavy/warped and out popped another me who came running out at me looking possessed - I tried screaming for my dad (hoping he would wake me) but the words were getting more quiet with every scream. Thought I was awake again but this time I just simply couldn’t move my body (apart from my arms) so I began banging on my bedroom wall to try alert my brother to wake me up ( because I knew I was dreaming ) but again - no cigar. A couple more of these weird situations happened and then I then looked over and a young me told myself “pretend this is a happy dream” and I sort of imagined a “happy atmosphere” and immediately woke up , sweating and realised it was all just one long dream and I hadn’t actually been screaming for help or banging on the walls. 

So, is this sleep paralysis or something different? just felt a lot more overwhelming than I remember. 

Thanks"
535,How to wake up(from my experience),Sleepparalysis,6,"Straight to the point: move your eyes as farrrr back and side to side. And I meannn farrr move your eyes around as back as they can go. This caused to me get up since my eyes were basically awake from the pain of rolling it so far back.
I used to sleep in class and I would get sleep paralysis. I tried waking up but nothing worked so I rolled my eyes around very far back and far right and left and I woke up! I don’t get sleep paralysis anymore but whenever I did the first thing I would do is do that trick and boom I was up."
536,Good SP???,Sleepparalysis,2,"I’ve never actually experienced SP before until earlier today while “sleeping” I wouldn’t call it sleep paralysis but I had the same experience as if I would. This happened about 2 times while I was sleeping on the phone with my girlfriend.

Anyway, I “woke” up in my sleep and realized that I couldn’t move or speak or do anything really, I tried talking but I could only groan but that lasted only about 10 seconds. 

I then fell back to sleep and this is where it gets weird. As most sleep paralysis tends to be evil or scary mine wasn’t. I “woke” up again feeling the same way but this time it looked Ike someone in a white long dress was at the edge of my beds feet. She was staring not at me but toward my wall and I can only see the side of her face. I felt like I could here her talking or something and I knew it wasn’t my girlfriend cuz she fell asleep with me at that time but nothing bad or scary happened. That lasted a little longer about 15 or 20 seconds.

When I woke up I was very confused at what I just witness and woke her up to tell her what just happened and she did say I was groaning in my sleep like I was trying to make words out

2 things: This happened in the morning and the woman looked like she was wearing a pig nose? I’m very confused by what just happened and if anyone can provide some opinions on this it’ll be appreciated."
537,"I return to Sleep paralysis nearly every time I go to sleep, I'm not even sure I ever truly sleep. I have many skills and how to; information when it comes to pushing through to get to the other side and how to overcome and when it's coming on!",Sleepparalysis,0,"(I'm a horendous speller) so bare with me please.

For some time now I have been wanting to tell of my tails whilst I dream, I have the most vivid dreams where I can tell you almost everything around me and the interactions I have with people, entities and things I can only describe as creatures. 

Each time I go to rest my body is over come with sleep paralysis, almost every time! Before when it started many years ago it was that of nightmares and horrors but back then it was once a week and gradually pushed it self on me like a jock at a party that wouldn't stop till it had me where it wanted me!

As time went on I was able to learn how to control the fear and run away from it, push my self to try to take back my dreams and keep the fear out! And I say fear because it's fear that changes my dreams and turns them, it's fear of the unknowing the gives my dream back to them and it's my inability to be strong and PUSH that allows what ever it is that wants control or wants me out and wants my FEAR!!!

So many tails I have, so many years I have experienced, people I have met from other times and other time lines. There are many tricks and things to practice while you start to dip into Sleep Paralysis and once your inside the grasps of SP how to push your way through to a side you can enjoy and explore! I have been wanting to start a tube page or a tic toc to try and help others with this and tell tails and how to fight your own battles. 

Let me know what you think and if that would be something others would want to know? 

Thanks for reading and giving me a little if your time as time is the only thing in the world you can never return! For that I am truly greatful!"
538,Open eye hallucinations,Sleepparalysis,3,"I do have SP every now and then and it’s usually messed up but last night was mild, not sure if it’s SP so i thought i’d share. Over the last few day i’ve not been getting good sleep (wake up multiple times panicking about getting an important email/ final results ..etc). I don’t feel stressed during the day,I honestly don’t but it’s like i’m a afraid if i sleep I’m gonna miss out on something important. So yesterday when i woke up at night I opened my eyes but i was still dreaming, i was hallucinating, seeing weird colorful patterns on the bedroom ceiling shifting and moving, music playing in the background. I woke my boyfriend up asking him if he’s seeing this ( I don’t why i woke him up i just did) he was confused asking me what’s wrong. After a few minutes I realized i was dreaming and told him to go back to sleep because (i’m still dreaming). I woke up this morning with the worst migraine+ tension headache, my neck and shoulders are stiff af. Is this considered sleeping paralysis Or just some weird lucid dream?"
539,The scariest thing you've ever seen,Sleepparalysis,8,I'm writing a horror story about sleep paralysis and want to hear everyone's experiences.
540,Seemingly real intense pain.,Sleepparalysis,8,"Just about 30 minutes ago (at the time of writing this post) I woke up from the most terrifying nightmare I’ve ever had. I was walking in circles in this dark space, no distinct ground, sky, or walls. I was walking around a blue cartoonish house, surrounded on all sides by a cartoony forest. When I say cartoony I mean it looked like a mediocre hand drawing in completely 2D fashion. However, in the trees, there was this white figure that grew a tiny bit closer every time I looped around the house. After a few loops, I noticed a strange faint ringing sensation accompanied by unintelligible speech and some kind of music I can’t describe: I can only tell you that it was music. After more and more loops and I could clearly see the figure, it was a white smiling circular face (cartoony as well) that seemed to only have a matching white torso with no details floating underneath it. No legs, no arms, nothing else. At this point, I started to hear the music louder, and it made me panic and begin sprinting around this house over and over, with each loop, the ringing and music got louder, but the talking stopped. The music at this point sounded like it had some kind of horn that was starting to hurt my ears really really bad. Then, I woke up. I was still really tired, and definitely freaked out, but I figured I’d be fine to go back to sleep. I closed my eyes and instantly found myself trapped in the same hellish nightmare. I felt an indescribable feeling of dread and anxiety. This time, the figure in the woods was gone, and there was a red figure in a window in the house speaking to me and playing an instrument, which is what I assumed to be a horn for some reason. I woke up again. I fell asleep for the third and final time, and this time was immediately greeted by this red figure directly in front of me, almost absorbing me, with the ringing and blaring music hurting my ears so bad it felt like real pain. I could feel it drilling down through my skull. I heard a child’s voice say “don’t be scared” and after what seemed like forever of this auditory pain, I woke up, and realized immediately I was in sleep paralysis. I felt the usual pressure on my chest, my ears still slightly hurt, but I felt like something was in my bedroom, watching me, waiting for me to fall back asleep. I tried to move but couldn’t, and I started to panic. I thought I was going to die. Then, I snapped out of it and threw my lights on. I’m not sleeping tonight. I still feel as if I’m going to die if I go back to sleep or turn my lights off. I really feel like something is still here watching me and waiting. I feel such an ominous dread and sense of malice that I’m not sure if I can sleep for the rest of the night at all.

I’m not sure if this was too long, but I wanted to share my experience because Ive only had one run in with SP before which was only a few months ago. In the dream beforehand I was on some sort of mineshaft rollercoaster and could really feel the drops. That was fun until a man appeared on the tracks and then I woke up to find a silhouette standing in the corner of the room. I’ve never heard anything in my dreams before, and I’ve definitely never felt real pain like I just did. That’s why this experience is so significant to me. Has anyone here dealt with this kind of thing before?

Edit: I should also mention that it felt like I was being slowly cut down the middle from my tailbone up during the episode of SP.

Another Edit: I’m only a teen going into Senior year of HS. Does this sort of thing usually get more common or can I expect it to get easier to deal with?"
541,When SP hit last night it felt like someone was trying to kill me,Sleepparalysis,10,"I've experienced SP quite a few times in my life but never really got to experience any hallucination, except for last night. I had a really weird dream where I was at a friend's house and one her cats started looking at me and then looking to the left as if someone was behind me. At that point I started to ""wake up"". I was lying on my stomach so I didn't see the creature but I felt a pair of hands tightly locked around my neck as if the creature was about to strangle me, then it felt like someone was trying to sit on my back so I couldn't breathe. I was feeling dizzy even though I was lying in my bed and I kept hearing a weird sound that would start very low and end in a whistle (I've seen people commenting about similar sounds, I actually think it's your blood rushing next to your ears).
Has anyone else experienced an ""attempted murder"" while having SP ?"
542,Sleep paralysis + nasal congestion,Sleepparalysis,0,"Man, it’s the worst. I get SP frequently upon waking up. Since this pretty much only happens during daytime I don’t have issues with creepy hallucinations, but holy crap, I can LITERALLY not breathe. On top of the heavy feeling and all that good stuff. Can’t move my mouth either, only eyes. When I finally do fully wake up after painfully long seconds of feeling like asphyxiating, I’m gasping for air. Sometimes that makes me so exhausted I fall right back to sleep, repeating the process 2-3 times (what’s your highest combo?) before managing to get up. Nasal congestion gets particularly bad randomly when you’re lying down, so I often have trouble falling asleep in the first place, which probably exasperates the SP. You’d figure that something that can keep me up at night would also cause my body to jerk awake immediately, but it doesn’t. So yeah that’s my SP experience 😅"
543,My most terrifying dream (???) ever,Sleepparalysis,3,"My sleep paralysis has always been quite a bit different than many stories I've seen here. Mine are actually dreams of paralysis. Meaning I wake up from them normally, and I don't wake up during the dream. It's almost like I'm having a dream of a sleep paralysis dream. I've probably had 5 or less such episodes. I HAVE had several extended periods of nightly hypnagogic hallucinations, where just as I'm about to fall asleep I here my mom call my name, even when I'm alone in the house. I also once saw a flashing spot of shadow that moved randomly around the ceiling for about a minute after waking up. I should probably note that I have bipolar disorder and mild attention deficit disorder and am on medication for that.

When I was 5 I had an extended period of nightly recurring nightmares of an evil doppelganger of my mother. The official story from my folks and from my childhood psychiatrist, who I have seen for the last 30 years, is that a medication they had me trying out triggered those. However, recently I have, through memory recall meditation and therapy, discovered that the content of the dreams probably stem from an incident I had blocked out, where my mom yelled at me very severely over an extremely trivial matter, and then I had hid under my covers and she cried over it. In my 4 year old mind I had made her mad and had made her cry, and I carried deep feelings of fear and guilt into my adult life without realizing it. There are other traumatic events too, but those aren't really applicable to this particular conversation.

I am currently making huge strides in being free of my addiction to pornography and the marijuana dependency that's grown around it. I also will be seeing a professional psychologist for the first time ever this Saturday. I'm really hopeful I will be able to understand my damages and finally be free to move my life forward. I also have been praying on it a lot, and I have had numerous serendipitous and unexplained events recently than I truly feel were God coming to me to give me the strength to make it through to the other side of this. 

On Tuesday night i had the first ""witch mom"" (what I called her when I was a kid) dream in years. But it was different. It was a sleep paralysis dream, very unlike my childhood dreams. I felt a heavy weight on my chest and then SHE was right there beside my bed and she looked down with this evil as fuck smile on her face, and then she spoke to me...but it wasn't her voice. I don't really remember what the voice sounded like, I just remember what it said: I have 47 names. As soon as she said this I woke up. 

I immediately googled ""47 names"" and what I found was truly disturbing...the 47 names of God from the Torah. I really don't know what to make of this. I've always believed in spirits and ghosts, I actually had an experience in a hospital after a serious car accident years ago. But I've never been sure if I believed in the concept of ""demons"" before. But I've never heard of ""47 names"" before. It almost felt like the message was ""you've been praying for God to come to you again...but tonight I'M here instead."" I could not sleep at all last night. Just like when I was just a frightened little boy back then, I am terrified to fall asleep.

Has anyone had any similar experiences, particularly with seemingly unexplainable things like ""47 names""?"
544,i started to experience this recently and im not sure this is SP,Sleepparalysis,3,"i dont really know if this is considered SP or not but i had two experiences 

one : which happened  last week or so , i opened and i could clearly see my room in front of me 

i was sleeping on my side and i noticed a shade over my shoulder at the corner of my eye and i wanted to roll on my back to see but i couldnt , all of this happened for like seconds 

two : which happened this morning , i woke up from a nightmare ( i was hiding from sth) and opened my eyes and once again i could see the room but i wanted to turn and get out of bed but it was like i couldnt control my body for seconds"
545,Did I have sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,0,"Hi all,   


I know this question is being asked a lot in this subreddit so let me apologize first.

I think I experienced sleep paralysis last night. Went to sleep at 23:00, lay awake in my bed till 00:30 (last time I checked the clock) and fell asleep. Throughout the night I woke up every 2 hours. Happens a lot to me so no biggie. But this time I woke up at 04:00-ish, and I heard an intense vibrating noise in my ears, like I was in a metal factory or something. It was really really loud, not a faint sound. My whole body was also vibrating. I wanted to turn over but noticed that I could not move my body. Throughout all of this I wasn't wide awake but more in a slumber between sleep and wakefulness. I immediately thought to myself:   


*holy fuck I think I am having sleep paralysis!*   


Yeah, never experienced it until now but a mate of mine has it and he always scares the shit out of me with his stories. I meditate a lot (being present with every experience, good or bad, just being with the experience instead of identify with it and getting carried away. Observe the experience instead of identify with it, like a professor observing something through a microscope) so I was able to remain fairly calm and for a second it was an interesting experience! *''Woah, this is actually happening to me! I am aware that I am having sleep paralysis, my body isn't moving but yet I am awake! How peculiar!''* Taking a stance of a professor objectively observing his object of observation through a microscope tends to give me more of a bigger picture view of the situation and makes it less personal.  


I did however closed my eyes as hard as I could, afraid I would see a ghost or something that would have definitely made me freak out and broke my equanimity. I started to try and move my toes and fingers as fast as I could and all of a sudden I snapped out of it and was able to move my body again.  


For all of those who have experienced SP, do you think I just had my first experience of SP?   


All comments are welcome!"
546,Reading or watching stories about Demons trigger my SP?,Sleepparalysis,4,Everytime I read stories or watch a story of demons or entities of that sort before I go to bed I get sleep paralysis. It has happened every time and is scary as fuck. Is it possible for it to trigger it or am I just overthinking a coincidence?
547,Anyone else?,Sleepparalysis,1,"My fist 2 experiences were with ""visions"". At teenage years.  20 years later, only the physical paralysis, fully aware of everything. Only happens every once in a great while."
548,"Not ""presence""/anxiety/negative emotions related SP: Does anybody else experience this?",Sleepparalysis,5,"Hi, I will try to be quick.  


I had my first SP years ago with pretty much all the symptoms described in the pinned post of the sub, feeling of evil presence, being pushed down, fast heart rate, and of course being aware of your inhability to move.   


I only experienced that kind of SP a couple of times, the one that happens most often is a much more subtle and unharmful, and it is actually the one that bothers me because it can happen a lot of times in a short period of time, with the series of ""events"" being fairly frequently.   


It happens when I'm trying to fall asleep. I would get SP after 5-15 minutes (in REM phase), when I wake up because of a dream or out of nothing. I wouldn't get, however, any of the specific symptoms mentioned in the [pinned post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/f8d1kj/identifying_sp/), just the basic one of being unable to move (and know that you can't move).   


What is interesting and annoying, is that when it does happen, it can easily manifest 4 or 5 times before I finally fall asleep. Like I would get in REM sleep, let's say, 10 minutes, then I would have SP for 20-30 seconds (I don't know the precise time though), then I would fall asleep and the ""cycle"" would repeat itself at least a couple more times. It happens at least once a week. It is worth mentioning that it only (or at least mostly) happens when I'm trying to fall asleep. Does anybody else experience this?"
549,Have you ever seen a shadow man with a hat in your sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,31,"I'm asking because I had to deal with it multiple times and I heard that many people experienced the ""hat man"". Have you experienced that? If so, what was it like? Did he attack? Did he just watch? Did he speak? Was he with other shadows?"
550,Sensation of being tickled?,Sleepparalysis,7,"I have been getting sleep paralysis for years now, I've had a range of experiences from feeling a presence in the room to feeling something on top of me to basically simply not being able to move. But my most common sensation during an episode is the sensation that I'm being tickled? For context I am a super ticklish person and I dont like the feeling but it always feels like someone is tickling my sides and I start panicking because I can't do anything about it. Does anyone else get a feeling like this?"
551,Wasn’t expecting to actually feel the gray hologram-ish silhouette.,Sleepparalysis,0,"I get fairly regular sleep paralysis. 
This one in particular (although not the freakiest) made me feel awful. 
I can’t sleep facing up like a normal person because as soon as i start feeling pressure on my body I know whats next. 
I usually know when i’m experiencing sp so I know that I need to calm down and focus on my breathing. 

This one morning I saw a person, just a gray colored hologramish silhouette of a woman sitting next to my head. I noticed it because I was trying to get up and something kept holding me by my shoulders. When I saw her I knew it was sleep paralyisis, so as a way to calm me down and realizing it is a dream I decides to touch her arm. When I did this it felt so human, warm. This weird awful feeling came over me, it made me so scared. I had to suck it up and make myself calm down so I could wake up. Just Awful."
552,Music for addressing sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,"I don’t know if someone has already said this, but I think listening to music as you fall asleep can help with sleep paralysis.

554,Was this sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,4,"i just had a nap and had a dream, my dream was ending and i was trying to get to my mum and sister in a car when telling another person i needed to go. as i started to move quickly i turned around and this person was possessed running on all 4s jumped up at me grabbed me, and at this point i felt a very very intense feeling as if i’d been possessed or had energy flying through my body. i then was conscious but wasn’t in my own room, i saw something in the corner of my eye so i slowly opened my eyes and it was my own room and i couldn’t really move i was in shock. i’m so confused as what just happened and my hands couldn’t move for atleast a minute after this. anyone have any ideas?"
555,Feeling Dreams and Sleep Paralysis,Sleepparalysis,2,"Who else suffers from constant sleep paralysis and reality questioning dreams? Share your experiences.

I have a few note worthy ones. The worst episode of sleep paralysis I remember was my first. I remember the a/c unit in the house sounding like an apache helicopter taking off for about 5 minutes. Constant roaring and vibrations in my ears. My heartbeat was so loud. Then random screams mixed with a girl asking. ""Do you remember me now?"", in a soft, echoey voice. Followed by a dark shadow sitting in a corner across the room that made me feel as though it was looking into my very soul. My vision was tunneled. My peripherals were faded to black. Faces, somewhat demonic, randomly appearing in front of me.
Since then I have probably had worst that messed me up, but there have been so many I can't remember them all.

I went months without another episode. Then maybe six weeks. Now, I could possibly have them multiple times a month, week, or night. Never when I wake up. Just while falling asleep.

I usually wake up, either from sleep itself or passing out from exhaustion with someone, most times my mother or another woman, screaming my name. Just one short, stern yell of my name.

The worst dream I ever had that made me question actual reality was followed by a terrible set of episodes of sleep paralysis. I always know when I'm going into the state now, but it doesn't ease anything. The hallucinations and voices are not something to get use to. Anyways. I finally fell asleep after about 30 minutes of constant in and out of paralysis. The dream was me and my wife in the living room. We were just having random, normal conversations. However, I found myself in a seemingly endless, infinite loop. Every time I would ""wake up"", I would find myself still on the couch with my wife in the same spot. After about 4 times I began to get worried. I would be having what had to of been anywhere from 5 to 15 minute conversations before spontaneously waking up into another dream. I remember even finally getting off the couch and going to drink a glass of water, followed by stretching and sitting on the floor, just to make sure I was awake, before again snapping back into another version of the dream.

This went on for literal hours. I know for I remember the last episode of paralysis was about 4 hours or more prior to the first dream. Time felt as it passed the same, and was agonizing to be in an infinite loop for that long. The thing that ended it? A fairly older, white haired woman who I never remember meeting before walked in the house. Spoke to my wife, and stated they were leaving. Her personality seemed very cold and otherwise calm. I asked where they were going. Was told it was none of my business. I asked to tag along. I was told no by the woman as well. At this point I finally believe I am awake, but am somewhat concerned. The woman's demeanor made me believe she intended to cause harm to my wife. That was until my wife and woman leave the house. The door opens. The outside is abstract. I can't move to stop her. I just felt a heavy sorrow seem to take over me and weigh my body down. I finally snap awake. Back on the couch. Frantically run to the room to check on my wife. Took a shower. Then for a few days I was constantly worried whether or not I was still in a dream state. That was weeks ago. Still has me messed up when I think of it. The entire set of dreams looking back at them just seemed like an American Horror Story excerpt. The lighting of the room and odd chill in the conversations. From start to finish I felt constant anxiety and fear, but thought nothing of it.

Let it be known as well that I can physically feel dreams. Not everything exactly, and not every dream. I can feel the breathing. Something touching my skin like the cloth of a couch or cold steel against my arm. I can feel fatigued after running or exercise. I can even feel pain and occasionally smell. As odd as that sounds, I know it makes me seem crazy, but you can only understand as to why I may have been pretty messed up for a few days."
556,Japanese sp demon,Sleepparalysis,1,"I just woke up paralised and I've felt someone in my room, I was expecting the classic white noise I usually get with sp but then some ghostly figure started speaking japanese. I'm not a fluent speaker and I didn't fully understand him but I love the language and I'm studying it. All I could understand was 殺すぞ (I'll kill you) and 死体 (corpse), his voice was monotone almost lacking any emotion. I've got used to these episodes since I experienced them for a long time, but this was the first time ever with other languages during sp and it was so scary.
Any experience with other languages during sp? Thanks"
557,bizarre case,Sleepparalysis,3,"I'l try to describe what i've been experiencing on a consistent basis and hopefully someone has an idea. Sleep paralysis is typical for me. I used to get all of the crazy stuff during paralysis like visions of entities standing in my room and demonic faces implanted at my wall screaming obscenities at me. At this point i have no fear towards these experiences and i actually find them amusing and funny which is probably why they stopped.

Since mid last year this is what has changed. In the moment i become conscious and start waking out of deep sleep its like an immense pressure starts to build in both my ears and brain. The more i force my self out of this state into regular waking consciousness the worst it gets up until the moment where i become fully awake and at that point it completely vanishes. The sensation is like something, maybe blood, is being built up to the point where it is trying to shoot out of my ears. This happens at leased on a weekly basis and its much more likely to occur when i sleep in.

Anyone got something?"
558,My SP experience,Sleepparalysis,1,"Hello all 😁- just wanted to share my experiences in SP and hear hopefully some of yours. When my SP starts I’m usually asleep/on the verge of sleep but it’s the feeling of being pulled into sleep that gives me the feeling of dread. I hear a loud static noise and there are voices such as people shouting at me and a weird male voice which recurs frequently. The voices are always taunting or negative even if I can’t make out specific words. I feel like I have to jolt or breathe heavily to wake up. I feel trapped and a sense of dread towards falling asleep. Does anyone else on this sub experience similar or the same sleep paralysis as I do and what has helped you overcome this? Would you recommend seeking professional help or any good coping mechanisms/prevention methods. It only comes around once a fortnight but is very intense and terrifying.

Thanks all x"
559,It’s a Back Problem,Sleepparalysis,0,"Hi fellow SP sufferers,

My SP journey started after being diagnosed with Epilepsy when I was sixteen, the dosage and type of medication I was on made me have these vivid nightmares, which led me to not wanting sleep at all but when I did sleep it was always for a few hours. My first SP episode; I could never forget it (I won't detail that because it still scares the living day light out of me). From being newly diagnosed with Epilepsy, Insomnia and being an overall teenager, having SP seemed like the cherry on top, don’t you think?

Though now I have no longer Epilepsy and no longer require medication, 8 years later. I’m still having bouts of SP, not weekly but they still linger.

Now when I’m not scouring the web on reddit forums, I am a researcher during the day. I know the mythology that comes with SP; demons; the old hag, The Pisaderia in Brazilian Folklore. Incubus and Succubus folklore, the Inuit people refer to SP as *uqumangirniq*, Japanase tradition call it *kanashibari*. Not just the culture aspect of things, also medically; I’ve consulted my Neurologist, his explained the whole REM sleep cycle. I’ve done my research on SP.

Yet I haven’t found anyone that suffers something like myself; and yes I’ve aware the all SP sufferers are not the same, we all have individual experiences, but I can’t be the only one right, right?

See, my SP experiences have only happened more during the day than at night; any time I fall asleep accidentally on the couch or take a nap on my bed on the weekend; because of COVID-19 I’ve been working from home a lot lately and times were I just close my eyes and rest turns into a half wrecked-anxiety attack. I never actually fall asleep on my back, I always fall asleep on my stomach, so when I have an SP episode it always feels like someone’s got there hands on my back pushing me down, my eyes are never fully wide awake, there just a tad open.

What I’m seeing during my dreamscape is always a family member; my mum, my dad or my sister (never at the same time). An episode I had a few days ago involved my sister, she’s away at the moment; so there’s no reason for her to be in the house, I fell asleep on the couch and when I “woke” she was just sitting there staring at me, I honestly thought she was back from her holiday. I tried waking up but my body wasn’t doing anything, this is when my anxiety kicked because she just kept staring at me not doing anything as I struggled, I realised what was happening because that feeling of an SP episode, it never leaves. So I calmed myself down, closed my eyes tightly and waited for the weight to be lifted of my back. It did eventually; what was left was a strong headache feeling, my back and neck are always cold after an SP episode and I mean it feels like I’ve been pressed up against ice.

I find these experiences quite harrowing because I guess I’ve always been told that nothing really (paranormal? If that’s what you wanna call it) happens during the day, it’s always at night, that’s why they call it nightmares because they happen during the night.

I’ve reached out to this subreddit because well, maybe I need someone telling me that this, is normal or I need to consult a sleep specialist because sleeping during the day like I’ve been doing…is not normal. Or what I’ve been dreading since I’ve started writing this, is that I need to see a priest.

&#x200B;

Tips or Tricks on how anyone handles SP are greatly appreciated."
560,anyone else have this experience? repetitive sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,1,"recently ive been having a lot more sleep paralysis than i am used to. i know it is probably due to stress but i  usually only experience sleep paralysis once or twice a year (since i was in middle school). since january ive had it at least 20 to 30 times now, some nights back to back, and it is really throwing up my schedule and making me scared to sleep, i am only 17 and do online classes and art commissions during the summer. 

basically it is when i am falling asleep, i experience sleep paralysis and wake up, but oftentimes it feels like it is forcing me to go back to sleep, wake up and experience sleep paralysis again, and go back to sleep, repeating the cycle 4-5 times. this is nothing like the sleep paralysis ive had in previous years. and i havent remembered dreams since i was in elementary, so i dont think it is dreaming either. i only experience tactile hallucinations as well. (also had a case where i felt like i was being splashed with water really hard, super weird but kind of funny. most of it is choking and hitting tho) benadryl can also trigger it.

 i already dont get a lot of sleep bc of migraines keeping me up, so now with me scared to go to sleep bc of paralysis, im not sure how to deal with it. i really just want to know if i am not the only one having this, and if it passes for those who experience these types of symptoms"
561,Need a little explanation,Sleepparalysis,3,Few years back I moved into a foster family’s house and the first night I stayed there I had sleep paralysis. I woke up with a huge sense of dread and couldn’t move. I felt weight at the end of my bed and saw this figure. The door was closed but the light was on outside so I could make out his figure and it had these goat legs and a big hairy head with horns. It was one of the scariest things I’ve ever experienced. As quickly as waking up to this being and being paralyzed I fell right back asleep. Crazy thing is that next morning the foster parents were scared of my because the attic door in there room was open and they thought I did it. Enlighten me in this experiment.
562,My sleep paralysis demon is disguised as my mom,Sleepparalysis,18,"
So this happened twice so far once a couple months ago and then again a couple hours ago. I’ve had sleep paralysis ever since I was younger. You know when you’re awake but you cant move, some people say they see demons, I know because I’ve seen them too. But lately my sleep paralysis have been different ... scary different. Let me explain 


So the first time I experienced the “scary” difference was a couple months ago. I was sleeping, and all of a sudden Im awake but I cant move and the lights are on in my room (which is weird because when i went to bed they were off) so because I’m used to sleep paralysis I already know not to open my eyes and remain calm, because I’m a scaredy-cat and I know if I see a demon Imma cry. So It stops and I try to go back to sleep but then it happens again. This time I can hear my mom in the living room talking, so I try screaming for her, she comes into the room and walks around my bed but doesnt say anything and I know she couldnt hear me screaming her name because she didnt have a reaction she just came in, so thats when i felt a negative energy coming from the part of the room where she was standing and I knew at that moment that was not my mom. So I close my eyes and she walks away and Again the sleep paralysis leaves but it returned one last time and this time I looked up at the ceiling and all I saw was a black figure with red bright eyes looking directly at me. And I couldnt move, couldnt scream. So i closed my eyes and when I opened them. My room was dark and there was no one in the living room, the house was quiet as a mouse. 


The second time , like I said was a couple hours ago. I was sleeping and all of a sudden I hear music (bachata to be exact) and It was like I was awake but I was sleeping, so I was trying to figure out if it was in my head or if it was real life then I started hearing chatter and it sounded near , like if there was a gathering in my living room and I could make out my aunts voice and shes talking and all of a sudden I hear my mom and I yell for her , but of course she cant hear me because its like I cant make any sound. As she approaches my door I realize its not my mom because shes in Florida getting out of surgery so theres no way shes back in boston so quick. And then what I thought was my mother comes into my room and just stands beside my bed looking down at me and I open my eyes and look straight ahead and from the corner of my eye I see the black figure watching me. And when it leaves my room the noise leaves too and i tried to grab my phone to call for help but When I tried to talk it felt like someone was pushing my throat and I couldn’t talk. And then I woke up."
563,Sp and choking,Sleepparalysis,2,I woke up early this morning to some sp and choking like i was choking to death.. it took me a min or two to get out of it thankfully..
564,Hearing baby playing,Sleepparalysis,14,"Okay so I never sleep on my back because I always get sleep paralysis. There’s not a single time I don’t get sleep paralysis if I’m lying on my back while napping. I don’t ever have scary experiences like seeing shadows or anything weird, I just can’t move at all. Well I decided to nap on my back earlier today and I woke up to a baby playing and running around my room, like it was maybe a 1 year old. And I tried to move but couldn’t. I lied there trying to stay calm but then I heard it at the foot of my bed and started freaking out. This probably isn’t that creepy but to me it was startling because it’s never been this way when I have sleep paralysis. Never sleeping on my back again lol."
565,Sleep paralysis dead speak to me,Sleepparalysis,2,The very first time this happened I heard an older woman speaking Spanish and told me sir can you hear me the minute I responded I fell back asleep but she was so happy that I responded after talking to some people I found out she passed away in the room I was sleeping in the second time I heard a person knocking I believed it was in the front door as I kept saying I'm coming I'm coming I'm trying to get up the man said I hear you I can hear everybody followed by the ticking of a bike being pushed my neighbor said it was a friend who passed away a couple years back said he always pushed around a beat-up bike that ticked a lot when you pushed it. The third time I've heard a loved one who passed away it was my uncle . the first thing he  said to grab my attention was my name after responding the first thing I said was I miss you he said it back has anyone been through something like this before I believe I was speaking in tongues gibberish but clearly I can hear myself in my head
566,EEG induced SP?,Sleepparalysis,3,"I'm currently being worked up for epilepsy, to try and figure out why I keep having seemingly unexplained seizures.
During my EEG today, I was trying to relax at the end of the test, like the tech asked me to.
I must have fallen asleep because I remember thinking, ""Wake up, its probably time,"" but immediately felt a presence by the foot of my bed, staring at me. I knew it was a black mass without really ""looking"" at him.
Then he spoke.
I didn't bother to listen to what he said because he sounded like a mf evil demon, so I immediately started to fumble over, ""Our Father..."" and by the time I was almost done repeating it mentally, it was over.
I've never had this happen to me before in my entire life, and now I'm terrified to sleep. The only thing I can think that caused this was the stress the lights caused me during the EEG. They use a flickering light with alternating frequencies for about a minute to see how your brain reacts to it.
I've had a splitting migraine ever since.
Thoughts?

Also, when I realized what was happening I tried to open my eyes, or scream, but literally only managed a tiny, TINY whimper. It was terrifying."
567,Did anyone have this feeling before?,Sleepparalysis,4,"Hey! Last night I had a SP and at the beginning of it I felt a strange sensation in my whole body, as if I'm electrified (if that makes sense). Like a lot of energy gets into my body. Never had this before.

Then I saw this demon/witch like figure with a light grey face. Then I woke up extremely dizzy and crying."
569,"Dae ""fall"" into sleep paralysis?",Sleepparalysis,0,"Like, I'll lie down for a nap, feel my body get lighter and then it just locks up and I can't move and I'm stuck. This happens to me as often as waking up paralysed."
570,Melatonin,Sleepparalysis,5,"Today (well yesterday) I woke up extremely tired but my body didn’t want to take a quick nap. So I decided to take some melatonin. I haven’t taken melatonin in over year, they finally kicked in and I fell asleep. The sp hit me once I fell asleep and it was a cycle of 5 sp. maybe melatonin is the cause for my sp? And taking more causes it to occur often?"
571,I’m so scared.,Sleepparalysis,9,"I don’t know what this was, but i’m truly terrified. I was sleeping last night and it was like an out of body experience. I think i knew i was asleep and i could see my body. it was like i was floating above myself. basically i saw myself in the dark in my room. there was a little girl who tricked me. she told me she lost her parents or she needed me, something of that context. i eventually said yes when she asked me to help her and take care of her. when i said yes her eyes changed and i knew she was a demon. i suddenly knew i was gonna die because i had said yes to this little girl. i don’t know what to do, it may be silly but i’m very paranoid and i’m afraid."
572,It happened 30 times... in one night,Sleepparalysis,2,"I’ve gotten SP occasionally since I was a teen, but last night was like no other. It honest to god happened 25-30 times. The second i’d close my eyes I became paralyzed. The worst one was when I’d been fine, closed them, then seconds later I was trapped and my head started spinning and swirling, when I broke out I almost threw up I was so dizzy. 

Then throughout the night I’d have crazy dreams, think I had woken up, but was still within the dream. Eventually I could break out and woke up hyperventilating and crying. My fiancé sleeps like a log so after the first couple times of trying to wake him, I just accepted it was going to keep happening. 

The oddest was when I “woke” up 4-5 times but was actually still asleep. That one was so hard to get out of. 

I’m shaking and I have to get ready for work. I hate this."
573,My experiences with sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,"Hello everyone.

I wanted to share my three experiences with SP.

The first one wa spretty basic but I was terrified. I laid there not able to move some dark figure was at my feet and I felt it looking at me. I was between 14 and 17 I believe.

The second one was the worst one... I was about 20 21, It was not exactly sleep paralysis because I didn't feel paralysed. I was almost asleep but not yet. I felt something jump unto my bed. By the weight I thought it was my cat... But when I reached to pet him I felt a different type of hair, I started feeling around the round fuzzy figure and felt a human baby face that aggressively jumped and sucked my finger. I remember it very vivedly. I jumped out of bed and turned the lights on revealing an empty room. What was more terrifying was that I don't remember falling asleep or waking up during this whole hallucination. And at the time I had never done psychadelics. 


The third one I was not afraid. I had already done psychadelics and I think I lost the fear of losing control. I was almost sleeping and started floating up. I looked behind and saw myself sleeping. I couldn't move but I was able to speak but every time I opened my mouth I spoke in gibberish and with demonic voices coming out. It was really strange but I just let myself go. I felt a tingle all over my body and started floating outside the window when I was above the house I fell back into my bed in a startle. This one was very recent like 2 years ago. 

Just wanted to share this with you guys."
574,Just woke up from the most terrifying dream,Sleepparalysis,2,"I was having an actual dream that turned into me laying in my bed. There was what I thought was a man who got in my bed like put his arm around me, then it felt like my ribs were getting squeezed. He got out of my bed and it morfed into a small boy whose face started swelling and scabbing on one side right next to my bed. Then next thing I know it was a small girl about two feet from my bed making the most disturbing growling demonic sound. I tried waking myself up and opened my eyes again and it was still there. Finally actually woke up and it was gone. 
I’ve had hundreds of sleep paralysis or lucid like dreams and this was the most terrifying one. I’m wide awake in bed now. Where I fucked up though is when the man came into my bed I had a negative thought about it and was like this man is not a real man, and then all of that happened. I know it was a sleep paralysis dream because I was stuck, but it felt like a horrible nightmare."
575,Are our eyes really open?,Sleepparalysis,41,"When we open our eyes during SP are they really open or just a hallucination, i’m asking this because i’ve had times where i’ve been able to move my hands and i’ve touched my phone to turn it on during SP and it didn’t turn on and when I woke up it turned on perfectly by just tapping the screen."
576,I got over it,Sleepparalysis,2,For past 4-5 years I have been getting sp almost every 2-3 nights. So my sp demon is a huge spider and I am covered in web and feel spiders crawling in my skin. Tbh I am not that scared of spider maybe coz I've had too many encounters with the 9 foot spider on top of me . But now I don't get any sp and I used to sleepwalk when I was young aswell. I don't go for sleepovers anymore coz I sleptwalk once and it ruined my life. If anyone has experienced something similar I would be happy to discuss.
577,"Hi, we're video journalists working on a short film about people's dreams and how the collective experience of coronavirus has affected them. Have you had strange or more vivid dreams since the beginning of the pandemic?",Sleepparalysis,7,"Please fill out the form to discuss your dream: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ku8-HLd2w9yXjoNyBkAI48wbqFYfvboPvnTN6ymltfM/viewform?edit\_requested=true](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ku8-HLd2w9yXjoNyBkAI48wbqFYfvboPvnTN6ymltfM/viewform?edit_requested=true)

Scientists and researchers around the world have noticed an uptick in vivid dreaming since the widespread onset of quarantine. There are many different theories about the rise in 'vivid dreaming' during this pandemic, including the increase in the amount of sleep people are getting during lockdown, an increase in stress and anxiety, and a change in sleep patterns."
578,Can sleep paralysis be caused by something other than stress etc.?,Sleepparalysis,2,"This was like 2 months ago and I hadn't had SP for a while (1 year, give or take). I decided to watch a YouTube clip of SP out of nowhere because of my past with it and the same night, it happened again. So I'm just wondering if me watching the SP video made some kind of ""placebo"" effect to my body, or if it was just a coincidence?"
579,Had sp for almost 10 years but this is new,Sleepparalysis,3,"Ive been holding off on posting this for a few weeks to try and process it. So ive had sp for 10 years now. I've found tricks to prevent it from occurring too often. ""Sleeping on my stomach, and if it happens I sleep somewhere else in my house for a night or two, etc"". But anyway my sp was always visual, mainly shadow people. The other week It happened but it wasn't visual at all i heard what I describe as chains dragging on the ground and growling.. i got these dark mental images of a creature thats hard to describe but it wasnt visual. My issue is everything felt so real for the first time in a while.. im unsure of how to deal with this new ""form"" of sp. Any tips on dealing with auditory sp."
580,Ringing in ears,Sleepparalysis,2,"I’ve been having Sleep Paralysis for 2 years but this is new, whenever I try to focus on something happening in my sleep paralysis my ears get overwhelmed with a ringing sound, for example during my last episode I thought about how i couldn’t move and i tried to move my arm to see if i was strong enough to do it, after a lot of practice i’ve been able to move my wrist to my fingers, but when i tried to move a loud ringing sound happened, has anyone else experienced something similar"
581,My story...,Sleepparalysis,1,"As a young kid I would have sleep paralysis all of the time.  It was disconcerting and extremely scary for me.  I could hear everyone awake around me but I could not move.  I also had to not let myself fall (as in giving in.. I am not sure if this makes sense).  To come out of this I would have to will myself to move with all I could muster.  It would jolt me out of this state.  Again, I hated feeling like this.  I wanted people around me to shake me to be able to move again.  The last time I had this, I was in college.  I felt the same thing, but this time it felt like demons were trying to pull my soul out.  I resisted as much as I could (and I was seriously afraid and worried to the point where I started paying).  I prayed and asked God to please help me to prevent my soul from being taken out of my body.  As soon as I did this, they released me and I shook myself.  I was able to free myself from this.  After this happened, I never had another also paralysis in my life.  25 years have passed and I am ok now.  No more SP.  Really really scary

PS:. I should also mention that I am not religious at all.  I am borderline atheist."
582,weird sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,"i experiences sleep paralysis last night but it wasn’t like i’ve heard it was, out of no where i felt an arm wrap around my stomach, and then the bed under me started to vibrate and shake? i couldn’t move at all and it lasted maybe ten seconds"
583,Sleep paralysis demon/thing made out with me????,Sleepparalysis,10,"Idk what my question is or anything but if anyone has had the same experience lemme know/explain why it happened pls? Basically I have had to sleep on my back these past five days due to a damaged nerve, sleeping on my back triggers my sleep paralysis. One of the times from last night I had the SP demon straddling me and then started to make out with me, like, tongue in the mouth etc it was p intense 💀 idk what to make of it, it just looked like a silhouette despite it being bright because it was the morning so I couldn’t see what it actually looked like"
584,I broke a VERY simple rule in sp,Sleepparalysis,26,"The one simple rule, is to NEVER open your eyes.

This morning I was still dreaming and I knew I was sleeping 

Then the sleep paralysis hits me and it feels like gravity just increased.

My eyes were closed, but I knew the was probably something there.

So I opened my eyes.

I saw a woman like figure on my bed with no eyes.


I was scared, but also angry, so my plan was to lift up my arm, and punch her.

It failed obviously,

My legs started to work so my plan was to move my body off my bed and onto the floor. In the hopes that someone would hear me hit the ground

It also failed, but that was because I got out of it first."
585,I call it the screamer,Sleepparalysis,5,"Does anyone ever expedite this? I moved into a beautiful townhome and before had never had SP but since living there in January I’ve had about 5 occurrences. Can happen at any time of the day - once is was a nap, once it was early evening, etc. I have seen it take the shape of my boyfriend once in a reflection in the French door glass we have in our room, but the most terrifying thing is that is sounds like a metallic buzzing that grows so loud it trembles my body. Sometimes I’m able to try and regain speech, other times not. And the episodes always happen 6 times. I keep falling back into it. Has anyone experience this?"
586,Being able to move during sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,7,"I’ve had sleep paralysis once in my life. It was terrifying, but it was unusual. I was sleeping on one side with my eyes open, and then I hear a shuffle ( it was the sheets on my bed) behind me. I paid attention to the sound and a few seconds later I felt the weight of someone or something crawling unto my bed from the floor. It kept crawling behind me this is when I realized I could actually move. I moved my right arm closer to my chest, I also rolled a bit more away from whatever was crawling towards me. Being able to move made me rule out sleep paralysis which made it worse, with that logic there could be an actual person behind me. I thought if there is a crazy person behind me there is a chance I’ll die, but I might as well die sleeping. By that time the creature was right behind me, I could hear and feel it breathing next to my head. (By this time I had closed my eyes) And suddenly it grabs my shoulder and it screeches in my ear. After a few seconds it stops and crawls back, the whole time I could move I just didn’t dare to see what was behind me. My ear hurt for a couple days after the event.

Edit: English isn’t my first language I hope you are able to understand."
587,Does anyone else get SP and it's no big deal?,Sleepparalysis,8,I don't want to jinx it but I have never seen anything while having SP. I've had it well over 100 times. The first few times it was scary because I didn't know what was happening. Now it's pretty much a non-event. I typically just roll back over and fall back asleep. Does anyone experience SP in this fashion? Ok now off to knock on wood...
588,Was This Just SP or Something Else?,Sleepparalysis,1,"As I was taking my power nap before I go to work, I experienced a different kind of SP.
First it was just your normal SP, then I started seeing people's faces, I dont even know who they are and I opened my eyes, my vision is similar when water is continously running down a glass, then I heard a womans voice she said "" You will remember my name again and live forever and ever. Dont forget"".

I tried to remember the exact phrase she said but thats all I can remember because her voice went softer and SP is fading too."
589,Is it normal to not be able to open your eyes in paralysis,Sleepparalysis,3,"I have had dozens of sp episodes but I almost never see shadows but always have auditory hallucinations and can't open my eyes. When I do my eyelids just flicker like butterfly wings to open for a second to scan the room. So while it sounds like I'm in a field of horses or industrial factory, it takes a lot of force just to see the room is as normal as ever"
590,It wasnt a shadow person this time,Sleepparalysis,2,"Ive experienced sleep paralysis for years now, but this time I saw something different. Recently there had been a shooting within my dorm, an indvidual who lived a few doors down from me shot his girlfriend and himself. When the sp started, it was business as usual until I looked and didnt see the usual shadow figure. It was the bastard who shot up my hallway, clear as day in a dark room. He leaned in close so I could see his face, menacingly said wassup (my nickname) then laughed before disappearing. Ive never seen something like it during an sp situation, nor have I had auditory hallucinations prior to this. 

Does anyone have any knowledge on connections between sleep paralysis and paranormal happenings?"
591,I’m scared and can someone help me identify this,Sleepparalysis,4,"I have never practiced lucid dreaming before but have been in a stressful environment (moving, job change, etc.) for about two weeks now. I can’t tell if this is sleep paralysis instead- when you are all saying “I opened my eyes” do you mean in your dream or in real life? 

Basically I have taken two naps and accidentally become lucid. In this dream today I was in a room and all of the people around me were speaking Spanish and ignoring me (I don’t speak any Spanish). I thought to myself “wow... they are going to tell me I died.” I was so scared- I knew I was dreaming and spent the entire dream hitting and punching myself, clapping, screaming for my partner to wake me up and trying to force myself back into my body. It took so long- I wound up napping for three hours. This shit really freaks me out- can any one help me figure out what’s going on?"
592,Was this sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,2,"Today I took a nap. I planned on actually sleeping but it turned into a nap, when I started to fall asleep I started hearing really distorted voices that werent mine, but they were still my thoughts. Then distorted sounds, after I fell asleep and I woke up 2 hours after I heard two voices in my head talking at the same time about the same thing. Then I tried to think about 2 different things and it worked but I couldnt like undertand them. Then however, It felt like I was crossing my eyes but SUPER intense, and I saw this flashing square with a square in each corner, all changing colors, I couldnt breath or move and I thought I was seizing, was this sleep paralysis?"
593,Multiple Episodeq of SP,Sleepparalysis,2,"Does anyone else get SP multiple times in one night?

For example I wake up with SP, beat it, go back to sleep and then repeat that cycle 2-4 times until I give up and just get out of bed."
594,Is there such a thing of Sleep Paralysis without ‘demons’? (Thinking I’m awake when I’m not),Sleepparalysis,25,"Is there such a thing of Sleep Paralysis without the demons etc? I think I experience sleep paralysis quite a lot but I didn’t know what it was, there’s never any demons or scary things like that instead I’m usually unable to speak and panicking about that. Last night I experienced what I believe was sleep paralysis it was so frightening that I had to google “realistic dream where you can’t speak” and I found the term ‘sleep paralysis’ then found this reddit.. I’m not trying to self diagnose myself or anything but what do you think this is? -

I often struggle to sleep and last time I was struggling even more than normal. I was awake at 6am still in bed with my cat and partner. I fell to ’sleep’ and I was kinda like dreaming that I hadn’t? I still thought I was trying to get to sleep. Everything was exactly the same. So I was still in bed and I heard my partner say what are you doing? And I replied just laying here, I can’t sleep, I think we spoke a tiny bit more then I leaned up slightly. Suddenly I fell back onto my back and my ears were ringing my vision was going blurry and fading to black and I couldn’t speak but I was desperately trying to scream or shout. I thought I was having a stroke or something and I was fighting to stay alive, I could see my partner like scramble around to get her phone (I assume to ring the ambulance). I seemed to wake up after that and I was 100% convinced that what happened was real life, I had to wake up my partner ask her if we just had a conversation and she said no, I asked her about 3 times convinced otherwise. I was so shook by what had happened i didn’t go back to sleep.

So do you guys think this is a form of sleep paralysis? As I’ve read a lot on here about seeing objects and demons but my dream felt more scary in a ‘realistic way’ if that makes sense?.. thanks!"
595,Looking for people who get sleep paralysis VERY frequently,Sleepparalysis,17,"I'm looking for any individuals who experience sleep paralysis very frequently. 

Anyone here get it every day? 

I'm interested in hearing your experience with it and how it affects your life. 

How do you think your life would be different if you didn't have sleep paralysis?"
596,Was this dream SP or something else you know of?,Sleepparalysis,0,"I was tired from sleep loss and fell asleep in the middle of the day. I dreamed a normal dream until it suddenly turned into a nightmare I’ve never experienced before. I was laying down on a bed in a room, so my mind felt like it was real. When I looked up 3 people were staring at me with dark eyes. One was my brother, although looking back he didn’t really look like himself. In his hand he had a tv controller, which he aimed at me like a gun. As we all know tv controllers are deadly so I was super scared. He and the other 3 people had dark scary voices telling me things. Things like “You wouldn’t want to get hurt, would you?”, even though I have no idea what they wanted me to do. 

As this is happening I’m suddenly behind a car outside the same house that I’ve never been to. I have almost no clothes on - I’m wearing what I went to sleep with. I see some people near so I hurry to take on a hoodie laying on the ground. It’s night of course and as I’m about to close the back of the car by reaching up to the button, when all my vision disappears and a guy holds me down on the ground. He and a girl beside whispers things I don’t understand. I think he’s about to rape me.

Then I’m back in the room again, my “brother” now holding the tv controller in a more reasonable way - as something to hit me with(even tho it’s still a weird choice of weapon lol). Now I’m already super terrified so I just want to wake up (I’ve been feeling it’s a dream for awhile). But as soon as I see the light from my real room my eyelids shut and I’m back in the room. This happens lots of times over a short period - I fight my eyes open so I can see a glimpse of light and they shut. I try to scream in real life for my mom to come and wake me, but no sounds come. The next time in the room I’m just about to get hit, and I protect myself with my hands. But nothing comes and then I wake up.

It’s probably not SP since I wasn’t in my real room but in an imaginary, but do you guys know anything about being unable to wake up or the shifting from reality to dream multiple times? I just felt it wasn’t like any nightmare I’ve ever had. Once I went up from my bed I felt like I wasn’t sure it was real, and that maybe the demons and my brother might just be messing with me. I didn’t know if I could speak so it took awhile before I dared to talk to anyone. Thanks for reading :)"
597,I’m scared this has happened twice now,Sleepparalysis,8,"New to reddit so sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit.
I am 33 yrs old and just recently had a baby I’ve had some crazy things happen in my life but nothing as crazy as this.theres been 10 months between these two experiences and I’ve moved and everything but when I’ve gone to bed I’ve woke up to something grabbing my hand and trying to pull me out of bed and I’ve had electricity going through my body both times the first time I was seeing red and heard screaming the second time was last night. I couldn’t move but also felt like I was fighting for my life this second time felt stronger I was screaming in my head and fighting I heard a male voice say “you’re not going to win” it happened longer too. I’m extremely scared and am scared for my little one because both times my arm that was being yanked was holding my little one. Please help anything will help anymore I don’t want this happening again"
598,A good SP experience,Sleepparalysis,0,"I use to have sleep paralysis pretty frequently. Like 1-2 times a week at least. I guess it's been about 5 years since my last episode though, and I'm not really sure why it doesn't happen anymore. I remember in the beginning it would scare the crap out of me. I would hear people in the room with me, talking to me or to each other. One time I heard 2 people talking in a language I couldn't understand, but I felt the message was important and I should pay attention. I've felt a dog lick my fingers (no dog in the house). I've heard my name being called in a very sinister kind of way. I had no idea what was happening, and when I told people, they just looked at me like I was crazy. Nobody seemed to know what the hell I was talking about. So I got online and googled my symptoms and started reading about sleep paralysis and all the weird things that happen to people during an episode... I mean, it was my experience to a T, except I dont recall feeling an entity on top of my chest like so many others did. Anyway, in the process of discovering what was actually happening to me, I also discovered astral projection, which I had never even heard of at the time.. I read about how people were turning their sleep paralysis into out of body experiences, and I was so intrigued, I decided to give it a go since my SP was really a pretty negative experience at that time. It was a game changer honestly. Anytime I felt the vibrations coming on and heard the roaring in my ears, I started to focus on separating my spirit from my body. Sometimes it was easy, sometimes not so easy. You know the force it takes just to move your fingers during SP? I put that same effort into rising up out of my body, or sometimes I would spin around backwards and come out that way. One time I reached for the bars on my daybed and grabbed them (in spirit) and pulled myself up and out of my body and then floated to the ceiling (I didn't know how to get past that point at the time). The last few times I have had SP, I have focused on leaving my body, and I've been successful. But like I said, I have not had SP in a very long time, and I am not sure why. I would love to experience it again, but I am not sure what I can do to make that happen? When it was bad, I was drinking a lot and sometimes using drugs that kept me up for days... I have been clean and sober now for about 6 years so I dont know if that has any relation but maybe? And to all the people who are scared shitless of SP,  please know that it doesn't have to be a bad experience. Just like a bad dream, once you realize you are dreaming, it becomes a lucid dream which is yours to control. If anybody can relate to anything I've said here, or if you have any insight into how to bring on SP, please feel free to comment! Thank you"
599,Sleep paralysis Awake,Sleepparalysis,0,"Lots of people say that’s you’re asleep when you have SP, but how come I can have my eyes open and I can’t move my hand but after 10 seconds, without closing my eyes, I can move my body again and it’s like I was never asleep."
600,Sleep tremors/paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,2,"This is pretty confusing, and quite weird and has been going on for a year. Maybe more. Many times during sleep or before waking up, my body has really intense vibrations. Sometimes they’re not bad, but quite frequently they have been really difficult to deal with. They’re not “painful”, but they’re very... uncomfortable? It’s a mix between the two, it’s the best way I can describe it. The past month I’ve noticed they always happen when I take a nap during the day. I’ll nap for about an hour and all of a sudden bam. I start shaking. My body starts vibrating really “hard”, mainly my arms and torso, rarely in my feet. During this time I am unable to move anywhere except my head, and the only way I’m able to break out of these tremors is if I move my head which basically breaks my body out of the tremors. The thing is, it’s very difficult. Like it’s physically hard to tilt my head to the side and sometimes it’s hard to the point where my head literally snaps back into place where it was. It usually takes three tries but after my head is free then I can get up and move around again. What’s also hard about this is my body’s really tired so I have a hard time getting up. Also,  when my head is free I still have this tingly feeling over my body which basically means my body hasn’t fully left the state of “vibrations” and can easily fall back into it if I don’t get up immediately. It’s happened many times. I honestly have no idea how this is still in my body but I haven’t contacted a doctor about this yet. I’ve been thinking about seeing a doctor about this for a while but never got around to it for some reason. But before I do I just wanna see what y’all guys think about this and perhaps what y’all think is going on. Also I hope this is on topic with sleep paralysis, mainly because I can’t move in this situation and it’s possibly related. Also to add, I’m unable to talk. I’m frightened during the paralysis/tremors that the best I can do is a scream/moan for help which no one has ever heard."
601,What the actual hell?,Sleepparalysis,18,"Okay guys, so yesterday something really weird happened. I was just sleeping in my bed when all a sudden my eyes open and I can barely move a single muscle. suddenly, this THING some shadow thing crawls over my body!!! I was horrified, I even remember not being able to scream for help... I didn't know what the hell happened and I tried searching for what happened. It looks like I have ""Sleep paralysis"" a mental illness (I think) that makes victims have illusions or something???? Nonetheless, I AM ABSOLUTELY DISTURBED. can anybody help?"
602,Sound Block,Sleepparalysis,0,"I have actually never had a conversation with someone about this, but it’s happened more than once. I am really fuckin tired and was trying to nap but strange shit started happening. I played a 13 minute long ASMR video and closed my eyes, looked a my cat sleeping next to me, cuddled him and was set. Next thing you know I feel weight on me (sleeping to the side), I can’t physically wake up or even open my eyes or speak aloud. But I still feel like I’m in my room. I struggled for a bit, a little panicky, but I remembered that last time this happened I tried yelling “NO!” in my head which allowed me to say it aloud but came out whispered even though I tried yelling (weird I know, but it actually worked and I’ve never gotten out of that trance unless I wait it out and struggle in fear 😭). I tried it for a bit because I couldn’t completely wake up cause I’m a lazy bitch and was hoping it would stop soon and I WOULD BE ABLE TO SLEEP. But each time I closed my eyes I felt as if I was LITERALLY being dragged from my legs off of my bed or grabbed by my arms and being pulled down.  And at some point it seemed like my eyes opened and I saw my cat, but the lighting was different with a flashing orangish light. But when I finally turn my lights back on so I can keep my eyes open, and stop allowing myself to experience this so many times :/. I expected to have, at least, napped  five to ten minutes, but I look at my phone and it’s about 22. The ASMR video is COMPLETELY over and I didn’t hear a bit of it and woke up around 8 minutes after the video. Funky shit bro. I hate it"
603,We all woke up at the same time,Sleepparalysis,3,"I believe that this simulation is breaking. I've have premonitions of our future in the simulation as well as my true self and it actually sounds crazy. It's like a parallel world, but it is the real one. Not everyone is in here with us. And not all of us are real here. I'm not sure if I should tell my premonition dream I had. It sounds crazy, but feels all to real. I just know in this simulation that the ones holding us here are making certain ones that fight them to actually suffer for revolting and fighting against them. I should know soon, once the simulation breaks.

I'd love to know your theory. I know there are 283 of us from my group trapped here. I am sure I have found two of us besides me. One I've told who believes we are in a simulation. We made a pack that whoever wakes up first will find the other. The other one wouldn't believe me even if I told them. But I'm 100% serious. Thoughts?

Edit: I was asked for more details and here is my comment.

[[[I'm honestly not sure about why 283. I just know that was the group of people in our fighting group. I was last of five in the group, as well as the leader.

I've had many premonition dreams recently. Though one is happening now that has to do with our government here trying to control us lesser people.

The other one is use being secluded in our homes, (please note this was before the virus outbreak) and being required to be home locked up. The homes are ruined down and limited to certain amount of use for electricity and electronics. Every home has a single TV installed in each house. And when a news report from the government comes on an alarm siren outside comes on for all to watch the show.

There was a red screen with a warning text scrolling up and a black and what video comes on with that blue color text at the bottom saying stuff but I can't make it out as I'm super focused on the movie.

The movie starts out with scientists at NASA working. I say to my mother ""This isn't the one with the baby chip in the space suit?"". Then it proceeded with seeing the mother and father chimps being worked on. Then the video pans up to see the baby chimp in the space suit that the scientists were sending to space due to the end of the world. Then it fades to black and I wake up.

Then the recent premonition dream I had recently was a five part one. Quite literally. The first part was that me and one of the five remaining team members of the 283 members were in a store which was a Walmart.

Let me move back with how this world and our simulation world are alike. Our simulation has the same things in its would as it is in the real world. Like said Walmart.

In the real world our would is under the control of some bad bad people, who are worse then here in the simulation. As they have complete control of the world.

They send people to this simulated world for various reasons. Some just for creating data, some to run and keep this world in order. Though the 283 members of the revolting members are sent here once captured are sent here and punished with pain, suffering, poorness, horrible things, etc. Not everyone who is going through this is a member, and not everyone here are even real. Some are NPCs.

Now this premonition is what happened before I got here. But it is my memory leaking through now.

Now back to me and the other girl at Walmart. We were there hiding out and trying to stay safe. We were heading out as we knew they were onto us. So we were heading out the right side if the store when we saw the guys down on the left side running upon us and some from the other side and back. We ran out of the store as black vans pulled up to capture us.

Note: In the real world magic and spirit animals actually exist.

As we were leaving my spirit animal, being a dire wolf came and I hoped on, and my friend has some sort of feline. We got on and made our way to a trust source. But the people were right on us.

We were on our phones to keep contact with the leader who we called ""boss"" as the codename. We had found out we were the last two left.

We made it to the contacts and hid in a large van. But they knew we were there. They surrounded us and came up to the van and as I told the ""boss"" ...""boss they found us...they got us""... they knocked us out and I felt I was entered into this world.

After I woke it was like my memory was coming back and cleared. J thought a bit about how real it was. It made sense. I then dreamed 4 more times of me contacting (more like trying to contact) my other 4 team members to try to help them wake up. But each time I was cut off.

Note: I believe that our spirit animals actually end up inserted here as well. Mine was 15.5 year old dog who was a soul bonded dog that called out to me that I had 14.5 years. I lost him in 2018 when shit really started to go crazy.

Like I said these things are crazy and I didn't go into detail on the first one listed.]]]

Okay so far during my research with others there are two things that all have had in common.

(1. Everyone during discussion of the simulation theory gain a horrible headache that can lead to a migraine. Our theory so far is that the people in charge of the simulation are trying to discourage and block us from discussing it.

(2. Each one I have talked with so far have shared them being in a white medical like room with scientists around. Most say ""s/he is waking up"" or ""s/he is fighting back"". Then most report a gray fog that ends up making them go to sleep. Then they wake up back in the simulation.

First let me say you have to be asleep to wake up in the real world. Then there you will wake up in the real world, but you either won't be able to move or fight due to weakness. And normally we are hooked up to something that has us hooked into this world we are in. The gray fog is something to put us back to sleep there and to make us return to here.

I know ones in real life who's had this happen and ones online. Those ones online have either posted in a post or DMed me. I don't ask them about it. But I wonder how many this has happened to.

I will still continue to live this life as we need to, as death is not the answer. And I will fight for more answers.

A bonus thing is the glitches. As the simulation is a bit wonky now. I as well believe the simulation is breaking."
604,Have you tried controlling what you see during sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,3,"I’ve just had this thought now, I can sometimes control my dreams so I was thinking maybe if we can control our dreams. theoretically one should be able to control what they see during SP since you’re still on the spectrum of REM. 

If anyone tries this or has already done it report back to me. 

Thanks"
605,SP every morning when wanting to go back to sleep.,Sleepparalysis,2,"Personally to me this is the most frustrating thing. Because I will seemingly wake-up at almost the same time every morning, around 10am. However since SP isn't my only issue, I also suffer from quite intense dreams or nightmares every night, I usually wake up exhausted and still super tired. Yet when I go back to sleep, it triggers an SP episode? Why does this trigger in such a specific way? Does anyone else get this?"
606,Anyone else have this?,Sleepparalysis,3,"Okay so I've had my fair share of sleep paralysis episodes, but they still freak me out.  Lately though, I haven't been having normal sleep paralysis.  I've been having *dreams* that I'm having sleep paralysis and when I come out of it, I'm still asleep.  Sometimes I'll wake up and be having a normal sleep paralysis episode as well.  Kind of on the same note, I have a lot of dreams within my dreams too, it's trippy.  I've never seen inception but I feel like maybe I should watch it lol.  Sometimes I realize I am dreaming and I will try and wake up during these episodes, but I can't.  This honestly freaks me out more than my regular sleep paralysis spells.  It's scary when you're sleeping and you try and wake up and physically can't... and I always feel weird after I wake up and really freaked out.  Anyone else experience this or know anything about this kind of sleep paralysis?"
607,A brief description of a “Hat Man” encounter,Sleepparalysis,6,"As the title suggests, I’m going to describe an experience I had with the so-called “Hat Man”. All discussion and opinions welcome. 

I’d like to begin by making a few qualifying statements regarding my beliefs in “the supernatural”. I do not consider myself a person who “believes” in ghosts, demons, or monsters, though a childlike part of me would certainly love to live in a world where these things exist. On any given day, I may be more open to the possibility that such things are probable or likely - it all depends on what I’ve been consuming lately. If I’ve been watching Neil D Tyson YouTube videos all day, I’m unlikely to give much weight to such things. If I’ve been down a Wikipedia occult rabbit hole, on the other hand, my opinions may shift.

Ok. Anyway. The story. 

I’ve always had sleep paralysis. I don’t remember when it started, but it’s been going on for years. Sometimes it will happen 3 nights in a week, several weeks in a row, sometimes I won’t have an incident for months or years. It’s been happening since childhood.

I was living in a house with some friends. It was a bi-level, my room was downstairs. There was a “mud room” at the back of the downstairs hallway that led outside, with an old workbench and tools in it, belonging to a previous (we assume) tenant. 

One night, I had a sleep paralysis attack. It was the most severe I ever had. I heard what sounded like distorted, warbling screams very loudly in my ears, as well as a deep distorted voice talking in an unknown language or making unrecognizable linguistic sounds. 
I couldn’t move, as is common. I felt the overwhelming terror and fear, as well as “the presence”. 

I could only look toward the door, as I happened to be facing it. I saw what appeared to be a humanoid shape in silhouette, wearing a wide brimmed hat. The shape was not all black, but rather, it was mottled and shifting - like when you press really hard on your eyes and get purple after images. 

It “moved” in the sense that it slid sideways into the room and remained by the door, but it’s limbs always remained static. Picture a cardboard cutout being slid sideways. The sounds, which I can only describe as “hellish”, intensified, as did the fear and the sense of danger. It remained there briefly, then slid back out. The episode faded, and sounds returned to normal. 

Now. A few interesting facts surrounding this:

- I had never heard of the hat man before, and did not know anyone else had similar experiences until YEARS later when I watched a documentary called ‘The Nightmare’. Imagine what a mindfuck that was for me, listening to other people describe this very same, or similar, vision.

- Other people who came to the house mentioned feeling uneasy around the mud room. One friend, who had never been to my house, and had no relationships with either the people that lived there with me, or friendships associated, called me out of the blue one night to tell me they just had a very disturbing lucid dream about me living in a house with a haunted basement room that was “dangerous”. This person had no motivation to lie, and to receive a call like this from them was very out of character for them. I can’t recall if this was before or after the paralysis episode.

- one of our roommates had a dog when we first moved in, and would let it roam free in that hallway when they were at work. It was a very friendly animal. Over the course of two months it became what I can only describe as “feral” and dangerous, to a degree that even its owner could no longer approach it for fear of being attacked. We had to have it removed and the owner “got rid of it”. (I don’t know what he did with the dog, if it was adopted or put in a shelter. I may have been told at the time, but I can no longer remember.)

- researching Hat Man, it is described as being associated with BASEMENTS and “negative feelings in a household”. I had a room below ground, and was experiencing a severe “Cold War” with two other roommates during this time period I experienced the paralysis episode. 

So there it is. Very, very strange. I have no other stories about experiencing anything remotely supernatural, beyond other episodes of sleep paralysis, though none produced visual hallucinations like this. I offer this information without a leading definite conclusion about what took place. These are presented simply as facts about “a thing that happened”.

More disturbing than the incident itself, is the events surrounding it which would corroborate some kind of “supernatural” experience. Again, I offer no final conclusion in that regard.

Thoughts? Anyone?"
608,The kiss,Sleepparalysis,10,"Earlier this morning I felt someone on my bed next to me give me a deep kiss, and when she broke the kiss she said you're mine in a high whispery voice. I haven't been able to go back to sleep because I've been really creeped out by this."
609,Is this sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,8,"One night around 2am I thought I heard a dog barking so I woke up it was still barking. The kind of bark that sounded as if it was being tortured. Whimpering and crying etc.. I woke up but I could move to check only my head could move. 

The dog stopped barking and that’s when I started to see flashes, the kind of flashes you see behind a curtain when it’s thundering and lightning. My blinds were all the way down but I could see the light flashes through the top and the bottom of the blinds. 

There was buzzing sound too like a giant wasp and whenever it got close to my bedroom door it would be really loud and flash it would move around the outside of my bedroom (note: none of this was inside my room all outside) it would be buzzing and flashing all around the outside of my room (another note: my bedroom is a small guest house out in the garden) it was decent weather no storms just average. 

I tried to move but I couldn’t and my breath was getting heavier and it was way more difficult to breath so I just held it. This seemed to go on for hours and hours but it was realistically only minutes. 

I woke up the next day in fear to move."
610,I think my dog saved me from sleep paralysis last night,Sleepparalysis,10,"I’ve had two experiences with sleep paralysis in my life. Both happened about 5-6 years ago, and then it never happened again. I think it hasn’t happened again because I learned how to tell when it’s about to happen and I force myself to wake up, get out of bed, and kind of “reset” myself, if that makes sense. 

Anyways, last night, I was having a very fitful sleep. Hot, cold, tossing and turning, having weird and scary dreams, stuck in that state halfway between sleep and awake, which is the state when it’s happened the two times before. 

In the middle of the night, my 6 month old pitbull starts barking and growling out of nowhere. I can say with 100% confidence she’s never done this before. She’s never even truly growled at anything before (except when she gets riled up playing tug, but this was a very different growl). 

It woke me up and scared me, so I got out of bed to figure out what was causing her to freak out and I couldn’t find anything. So I calmed her down, she went back to sleep and so did I. I slept perfectly fine the rest of the night. 

It’s been bugging me all day today and I’ve been trying to figure out what she could have been growling at, because I know it wasn’t nothing. 

Then it dawned on me... I think my dog saved me from sleep paralysis. I don’t know how she knew but I’m so grateful."
611,I went through the list of symptoms pinned and my recent dreams don't really line up. Sorry to be that guy but is this SP?,Sleepparalysis,2,"I've had a recurring set of dreams lately but they don't align with the standard symptoms for most people, or the list that's pinned at the top of this subreddit. Pretty much what happens is I wake up in the same place I fell asleep in under the same circumstances I fell asleep in. For example, today my girlfriend is at work right now and in the dreams she came back from work.

The issue is that I don't have the common symptoms that I've read about. I don't wake consciously and be unable to move. I'm not panicking, nor have I opened my eyes and kept dreaming (as far as I know). I don't feel a pressure placed on my chest, I don't see or feel a scary presence, nor do I have nightmares before or after (or ever really). The only symptom I can think of is that I feel heavy/stiff, and occasionally speaking is hard. Edit: I forgot to mention that the harder I try moving, the less I can.

All it is is a cycle of dreams where I wake up where I fell asleep and everything seems normal (like my gf getting home) but when I start moving around or doing stuff, weird things (not scary) happen that tell me it's a dream. So I try to wake up from that and I finally do it's normal again but then more weird things happen. This cycle of waking up to still being in a dream happens probably 5 to 8 times before I actually wake up. I'm certainly weighted down or stiff, but never unable to move entirely or unable to breath. Is this SP?"
612,Only in the light,Sleepparalysis,2,"Why do I only have episodes of sleep paralysis, when there's enough light in the room to make out the furniture? I typically sleep in as close to total darkness as I can. I've noticed that I only have episodes when there's a substantial amount of light in the room, from my door being open or it being the middle of the day and the light coming through my dark curtains just enough."
613,Sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,2,So this happens a lot especially when I’m very exhausted I lay in bed and right when I drift off I get paralyzed for like 3 seconds and jolt back awake and heart racing. Especially i noticed when I lay on my back and there has been times it’s lasted for 10 seconds and I’ve experienced sleep paralysis fully before but it doesn’t seem to be that but not sure anybody know what it could be ?
614,Portal 2 crying core woman,Sleepparalysis,0,"So I woke up on my side after waking up at 4AM and going back to sleep on my back (my biggest mistake, lol) at around 4:30am and I had my eyes closed when I woke up, but i was still paralyzed. My air conditioner slowly turned into sniffling sounds, and I was having visions of a portal 2-esk test chamber. There was the same little hookup thing that Glados and Wheatley hooked up on to control the facility, it felt huge. The minute I walked up to it. It was one of the cores from portal, but it had a very unsaturated pink eyeball. When I pulled it out, it started SOBBING. just a woman. No robot voice to her. Literally sobbing. Sorry if this doesn’t make sense as I am SO exhausted from being stuck awake after this experience 😂"
615,How would you depict Sleep Paralysis in a film?,Sleepparalysis,3,"I’ve never experienced Sleep Paralysis (that I remember at least, I feel like I may have experienced it auditory when I was younger) but I’ve been obsessively intrigued with it since I heard about it. I even have a guilty desire to experience a terrible sleep paralysis (knowing full well that I would be terrified).

Another thing —probably one of the biggest things— I am interested in is film, I want to be a filmmaker. So I got to thinking how I would depict Sleep Paralysis on film based on accounts from those who experienced it and I’ve got quite a few good ideas in my opinion.

But I want to ask, how would you depict Sleep Paralysis in film? And are there any good depictions of it that already exist in movies (or bad)?

In contrast if you want you could say what you would 100% not want in a depiction."
616,I made a connection with green?,Sleepparalysis,0,I don’t know what it is but this morning  I woke up then shut my eyes for a short period and in my head multiple choices showed up I can’t remember the other ones only the one I chose which was make a connection with green I then immediately had my first ever experience with sleep paralysis but it wasn’t bad I couldn’t move at all but I moved a hand I’ve never moved before and I saw beautiful vibrant colours that I’ve never see before for a split second it also felt like I was falling at an extreme speed as my body was under a constant pressure and my ears were doing that thing were wind goes past and ur earwax makes a weird noise when u ride a bike I’m just confused what a connection with green means and I asked my sister and dad who have suffered from sleep paralysis and they don’t know
617,Can you hear voices during sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,63,"I looked it up online and apparently most people hear muffled whispering or barely audible or meaningless noises, like tapping or whatever. I have never experienced sleep paralysis before, but I experienced it tonight I believe. During my experience I heard clearly audible enunciated stuff. I woke up from a dream, and I heard a voice outside of my head that was very low pitched saying ""HA HA HA!"" I have never experienced this before so I was SHOOK. I am religious so I tried to call upon Jesus' name to get rid of it, but I couldn't speak, my throat was like paralysed (hence why I assume sleep paralysis), but very quickly I was able to move and I basically told it to get lost in Jesus' name and it did. Then I started to go back to sleep again and I heard a pig squeal externally. I was shook again and this time freaked out about sleeping. It was like ""SQUEE!"" 😂 It was super scary because I've never experienced it before. Can somebody explain to me about auditory hallucinations and if this sounds like them, and if this is sleep paralysis? I think it is, but I am wondering why most people hear very subtle voices and I heard really specific ones? I also didn't hallucinate anything, I just heard stuff."
618,Shaking due to fear in SP,Sleepparalysis,0,Every time I get frightened by the things I see my head shakes intensely. It’s just a motion of left and right but really really fast and with my body feeling like it’s vibrating as hard as it can.
619,Eyes Closed Sleep Paralysis,Sleepparalysis,7,"I’m pretty sure I’ve had sleep paralysis, but I’m a little confused bc in everything I’ve heard, people usually have their eyes open and hallucinate. 
My eyes were closed, and I tried to open them but it felt like someone was holding them closed, I also heard someone banging on my door and screaming to let them in but my roommate says there was never anyone there. I had no idea it wasn’t real and I was freaking out because my body wasn’t moving and I couldn’t see anything and I thought someone was trying to break in and I wouldn’t be able to defend myself. 

Is there a way to prevent this from happening again? I have no idea what triggered it. Was this really sleep paralysis, and if it was, is it unusual that I couldn’t open my eyes?"
620,Sleep paralysis every day and multiple times in a row each time. Someone help,Sleepparalysis,22,"For a few years now, I have been experiencing sleep paralysis semi-frequently. Recently though I have seen it start to happen every day at around anytime from 6 am-12 pm. The problem is my sleep paralysis isn't something that happens once and is over, I have multiple in one day and in rows. I don't know the best way to explain it but let's just say it's in cycles. I sleep, then I get sleep paralysis, I break free from it, and IMMEDIATELY get it again. This cycle usually goes on for about 6-10 times until it just stops naturally or until I force myself awake. This makes me exhausted in the mornings because technically I'm not sleeping.

Is there anyone that knows the causes or how I can stop this problem. Anyone that is experiencing the same things?"
621,"how do i induce sleep paralysis, do i need to have my eyes closed or open when staying still",Sleepparalysis,10,"i want to induce paralysis to see wat its like, a bunch of youtubers are saying stay still tried it. it kinda works, but they dont explain if your eyes need to be open or not which is it"
622,Sensory hallucinations during sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,2,"Hello!

I am aware that you can experience sensory hallucinations, such as pressure in your chest etc during sleep paralysis. But in my case, most of my sleep paralysis experiences are sensory and audible hallucinations, and some of them are creepy as hell. Here's the few creepiest ones i've gone through.

1. Giggling children under my bed

So I was jolted awake by the sensation of someone rocking my bed from underneath it (lifting it with their feet, hands etc.) I heard two clear voices giggling and laughing underneath my bed, and it felt like it was two kids doing it. They seemed playful but at the same time kind of menacing - they definitely wanted to mess with me.

2. Blowing in my ear

I have this weird thing that i can't fall asleep unless my up facing ear (i sleep on my side) is covered by my blanket. It often moves away from my ear while i move when i sleep. One night I woke up to the sensation of a short, strong blow of air in my ear (my blanket had moved). I was confused if it was real or a dream, but I had a couple more sleep paralysis episodes that night so it seemed like a hallucination.

3. Getting dragged by my feet or lifted from under my arms

This is awful, because it feels so so real. It has happened multiple times. I wake up to the feeling of someone grabbing me from my feet and pulling me to the foot of my bed, or someone grabbing me from under my arms and trying to pull me underneath the bed. The awful feelind of ""actual"" hands grabbing you while u are unable to move is horrible. When i am able to move and open my eyes, I sometimes haven't really moved at all or sometimes i have moved to the place i was being dragged to. 

4. Other random stuff

I often hear my name called, my dishes crashing, my tv on or music playing etc during an episode. I have felt my hand go through items such as my phone in my hand or my wall. I've also clearly heard and felt a phone vibrating in the foot of my bed, and i really thought it was my actual phone when i was able to move because it felt so real - my phone was actually on the nightstand.

Anybody else with similar experiences?"
623,Is it sleep paralysis when you can move?,Sleepparalysis,10,"I mean, obvious answer is no... But I wake up to things sometimes. Standing over me. But I can move. 

Or I wake up feeling in my body? My body feels asleep. I can feel tingling all over and I can feel my chest rising and falling. I can feel my throat swallow. 

I've explained it to people and I was told it was sleep paralysis, but I can move. If I move, my body wakes up and the sensation goes away."
624,Positive sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,"Last night I had a positive sleep paralysis experience and have been doing research to see if this has happened to anyone else. So far, I’ve found nothing.

So I woke up at around 4AM and couldn’t move. I had a positive sensation run from my head to my toes that felt orgasmic. I then heard a mans voice in my head say “fear not, fool”. “Fool” drifted off in a weird stereo way, like switching between one ear and the other. I then had full control over my body and felt energized. My cat quickly jumped on me and at first I was scared but then felt weirdly comforted and happy. I’ve felt amazing all day and my body has felt great. Has anyone had a positive experience like this before?"
625,An earthquake with sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,"I’m from Mexico and in 2017 we had a really strong earthquake. I feel like this event triggered a lot of anxiety for me and I started to be alert at all times, and now I get really scared easily. The first time I had SP was a week or so after the it happened, I woke up because I felt an earthquake, I was so overwhelmed and I tried to get up from bed and scream to let my family know what was happening but I couldn’t do so, I felt my bed shaking and I heard the walls cracking but I couldn’t do anything about it. When I woke up from it I was crying and I got up really quickly to see if it was real or if it was just a dream. At first I didn’t understand what was happening but after the third time I was sure I was suffering from SP. I’ve experienced it at least 10 times so far."
626,Yooooo gabapinten.,Sleepparalysis,2,"So I talked my new psychiatrist about my sp. She popped me some gabapinten. Shit works for restless leg syndrome. Sure af works for sleep paralysis. so if it’s an on going issue for you this may be an option. 

Warning tho: makes the nightmares way worse. The sp was waking me out of them so they weren’t as bad. So get on that med card or call your dude and thc the dream world away. Also it only lasts 6 hours so you may wake up to one but I found when it’s light out there not as fucking scary. Just silly. 

Good luck. Hope I can help someone else out. Stay sane.... at least a little bit.

Edit a funny typo popped not pooped.  (I also messed it up wile typing this) my dr did not shit out the meds. I think that would be unprofessional, and astounding."
627,Acid triggered my sleep paralysis? help?,Sleepparalysis,20,"its 5:57 am 7/1, i took acid the night before yesterday 6/29 and tripped from 11 pm-6 am then i was fine until i saw some visions around 7 pm yesterday until 10 pm when i fell asleep. i woke up at 2 am and I've been up since..

except i put on a Grumps video to sleep i saw maybe 1 min before shutting my eyes. immediately i was dreaming. i heard someone say ""it smells like"" and they took a sniff but my eyes snapped open and i realized the sniffing was real and behind me but i couldn't move. I felt the breath between each sniff it was like a dog. i shut my eyes and tried separating my jaw and kept trying to throw my arms. the thing stopped sniffing and i heard a creak. i felt like i was completely surrounded by static and it was over. i checked my laptop and it had literally been 2 minutes. I get an 'extra narrator' in my head when i take acid and the voice told me it was a giant dog demon thing and it's hiding in my closet. (no im not checking it)


This has never happened before when I've slept on acid or other drugs and I've only ever had one other paralysis experience but that was 2017. Can i get tips in case this happens again? Or if anyone can give me their opinion of what triggered it so i can avoid it?"
628,Is “anxiety” connected to my SP?,Sleepparalysis,0,"For as long as I’ve known, I could always predict when I’m about to have SP.  it’s this really hard tingling near my left armpit and every time I got it I would have my episodes. My friend has really bad anxiety and would have tingling on the tips of her fingers and said I probably have anxiety because of the tingling I get. I dislike self diagnosing in my opinion and I don’t find a reason to go to the doctor for “anxiety” (I’m quoting anxiety because I don’t know what the tingling is). I’m going to the doctor soon for me episodes since they’ve been like night terrors and I’ve been scared of going to sleep now."
629,Is this SP?,Sleepparalysis,1,"Just before I get into what happened, this post is slightly graphic and there are mentions of blood, all within the possible sleep paralysis.

This was many years ago but I remember it pretty vividly. To start off, just for some context I move around a lot in my sleep so my mom put railing on the side of the bed I slept on to make sure that I wouldn't fall off, it was only on the one side. Also, on the side of the bed I slept on, looking at the railing there was about 1 ft space between the bed and the dresser, which held the TV, there was a window on the wall behind the dresser which had this white curtain covering it. It didn't split in the middle, you pulled it back from the sides.

So, I was around 5 or 6 and I woke up in the middle of the night. I couldn't move anything but I saw these 4 clowns standing right next to the bed, in between the bed and the dresser. The curtain over the window was moving as if there was a breeze passing through it, even though there was no fan on and the window had been closed when we went to bed. Going from closest to me to farthest away there was a green clown, orange clown, yellow clown, then red clown. They were all smiling very wide and creepily with none of their teeth touching, and they had razor sharp teeth dripping with blood. Their nails were also extremely sharp, and dripping blood.None of them moved for a few seconds until the red clowns grin stretched wider, and it's body elongated until it's head was right above mine. It's teeth dripped 2 drops of blood on me, slowly, as it's hands stretched towards me, and it's head got closer and closer to my face. As the 3rd drop of blood hit my face, everything went black until my eyes snapped open again, and they weren't there anymore. We didn't have a clock in my room so I didn't know what time it was or how much time had passed.

I didn't feel pain or anything, no pressure on my lungs or anything like that, just terror. When my eyes snapped open again, I could move, and to this day I'd not sure if it was sleep paralysis, a hallucination, or (very unlikely for what I saw and how the clowns acted and the fact that everyone that was in the house is still very much ok and alive) if they broke in through the window.

As such, I found this subreddit and wanted to know if this was actually sleep paralysis or not, it's the only time I've ever seen clowns like that ever, and if it was sleep paralysis, it's never happened again."
630,My first experience in over six months,Sleepparalysis,0,"I’ve been dealing with sleep paralysis for a few years. It always only happens when I take naps. Never when I go to sleep for the night. This dream just happened to me a few moments ago. Before I took this nap, I texted my girlfriend of almost two years talking about how I plan on going on NoFap for 30 days and that I didn’t want to have sex the next time we met up (long distance college relationship; we’re scheduled to meet up again on 7/18). This adds some context because I’ve been internally dealing with the morality of masturbation/pornography for years. I told her in my text that I’m dedicating the month of July to semen retention. If anyone has an explanation given the context, please drop a comment. Here is my dream. 


It started off me being in the middle of this little league baseball field. Felt familiar like one that I’ve played at before. I was on this motorcycle. Before the nap, on my drive home, This guy on a motorcycle was doing all these crazy wheelies and showing off to other cars, so that could be why I’m on a motorcycle in the dream. I let the motorcycle go as fast as it can and I’m about to crash into the fence and a bunch of cars. I’m going so fast and I feel like I’m about to crash and I see myself about to crash, but I can’t crash. It’s almost like those dreams where you’re falling off a never ending cliff and when you get to the end you just wake up. 

Eventually, I get off the ground. The motorcycle and I are now flying in the air. I know something is guiding the motorcycle because I could feel that I didn’t have control over where it was going. I wasn’t in control over it. Someone else was. 

Next thing I knew I was flying into this church through its stain glass windows. It was the Catholic church my family and I have been going to all my life. I was still on the motorcycle, but inside hovering over the alter and the cross. A big shadow of a face appeared before me, much like paintings of Jesus with the long hair and beard, but he had a way longer nose. I asked, “what am I doing here? Why am I here?” I know sound came out of my mouth while I was sleeping because I was half awake and could feel vibrations. Probably wasn’t those words, but just mumbles. 

The next thing I knew I was half awake, but now I’m staring at my feet. I see the foot of the blanket being lifted and flipped around in waves. The fan is on, but the fan isn’t powerful enough to deliberately take the cover off of my body and waive it back and forth. I still feel the presence of someone else in the room. Next thing I hear is heavy breathing right next to me. Sounded like I was cuddling with my girlfriend listening to her breathe heavily as she slept. I thought that the something was a good something and I felt at ease. A few seconds later I feel that something reach around my legs and I see indents being put on my blanket and I feel hands. Then this something becomes restless and starts breathing heavier and sounds like it’s struggling. I feel the something then reach around my back side and I feel fingers around my butt. I then knew that this was not a good something. It was a bad something. The bad something reached its hands down my pants and tried to finger my ass; sexually violating me. I said audibly, “please stop” as that was the only thing I could do (or at least that’s what I think I said. In actuality, sleep paralysis speech is mumbles). I just had to let it do what it wanted because I couldn’t move. Then I finally gained control over my body again and jolted myself up to full consciousness.

If you’ve had a similar experience, especially if you’ve been dealing with sexual temptation or the morality surrounding sex and pornography, please drop a comment and share your thoughts. Thank you!"
631,Family member sleep paralysis demon,Sleepparalysis,5,"Weird question- why do I keep seeing my sister when I get sleep paralysis? It's not always but it's just often enough that It struck me as weird. When she left for college it stopped- and I expected it to start again when she came back but it hasn't. Does anyone know why? I'm not entirely convinced she wasn't just messing with me- but if she was, she has excellent timing. Is it, like, a psychological thing? She just stands there. I would appreciate if someone would tell me why cause this is getting weird."
632,Fell asleep on the couch and thought there was an earthquake. Tried to yell out for help (bf in the bed) and I couldn’t make a sound.,Sleepparalysis,0,If felt like the quake lasted 3 minutes. I was trying to yell out to my boyfriend in the bedroom. I realized upon coming to that there wasn’t an earthquake as my dog and cat who both decided to sleep with me on the couch were out cold. Trying to yell help and being unable to was pretty scary but I have actually been interested in the idea of astral projection lately.  Realizing I might of blocked myself from going further out of fear.
633,"TIL that every single time I have remembered a dream in my adult life, it was in fact sleep paralysis.",Sleepparalysis,0,"So, I remember (as in, I am conscious of the fact that I had a dream at all) about one dream per every 6 month period. I’m using the term “remember “ rather loosely here, as if I do not immediately write down what few details I can bring out of the dream and into the conscious realm within .003 seconds upon waking, I will only be vaguely conscious of the fact that I had a dream upon actually waking up the next morning. By this point (hours after actually having the dream experience) any actual details of what went on in said dream are always long gone, unless as previously mentioned I had written them down immediately (which I’m usually incapable of doing cohesively). 

Anyways, onto the point. I just spent 2.5 hours in a state of sleep paralysis, stuck-dream that just keeps getting exponentially more fucked up and absurd the longer it drags out, where I was in fact actually paralyzed in the dream. I then googled sleep paralysis upon waking, because I had heard the term somewhere before, and this was an especially fucked up dream and has me still mentally fucked a good 30 minutes after waking later.....

Guys.....GUYS! Sleep paralysis is not being physically paralyzed IN THE DREAM.... it’s the feeling of being stuck half-way between dream state and reality. Where you’re consciously aware that you’re dreaming, but not in control of said dream and unable to wake yourself up. I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST WHAT DREAMING WAS. Every dream I’ve ever “had”, was not actually me dreaming like normal people, where you’re in control and it has the possibility of not being traumatizing...but actually me being held in sleep paralysis by the powers that be (or the sleep demon...or maybe the sleep demon IS the “powers that be”) EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. 

MY MIND IS BLOWN. AND I’M CONCERNED. 

(Also, this may not be coherent, I don’t think it will actually convey the epiphany I have had tonight since I’m not quite capable of writing a single sentence cohesively atm. Bear with me, I will try and edit tomorrow. Hopefully I have enough of the point down.)"
634,does anyone else do this?,Sleepparalysis,5,"i’ve had what i think is sleep paralysis for most of my life ever since i was a little girl. when i do get it i obviously am paralyzed and i can’t move. after im aware of the fact that i am in sleep paralysis (im not always aware) my consciousness shifts to “dream mode” and i start having weird or creepy dreams. obviously this is a very scary experience for me so i try to wake up out of sleep paralysis. does anyone else  try to get out instead of leaving it be? since my body is very exhausted, getting out is kinda painful and i have to “PUSH” myself out of sleep paralysis and i start shaking. if i dont push far enough im stuck. does anyone else do this?"
635,"How to deal with SP when you're not actually ""conscious""?",Sleepparalysis,13,"I've had a couple of episodes of true paralysis, where I've been awake and frozen in place-- one in my bed and one after sleepwalking to my bedroom door-- but I also have episodes of something else several times a week.   


Usually, what it consists of is: I have a nightmare. At some critical point in the nightmare, I'm confronted with a ""demon"" which comes in various shapes. My entire body freezes up and I cannot move. Sometimes, I'm distantly aware of real-world things (the sensation of my bed, surrounding noises, light, etc.) as well as realizing that I'm dreaming, in which case I flit in and out of sleep and wakefulness, conscious of both worlds, until I manage to make a sound, which instantly breaks the paralysis. As you could imagine, this results in a lot of ""waking up screaming"".   


Other times, I don't realize I'm dreaming, and I'm just paralyzed in the world of my dream, usually by fear. I'm usually stuck for several seconds, and when I finally do move, it either jolts me into the half-awake-half-asleep realm, or drops me into a different section of the dream.  


I'm fairly certain these are all forms of SP. However, when I'm not able to gain cognizance of the fact that I'm dreaming, it's impossible to coach myself through dealing with the paralysis, because my dream self doesn't know what's happening. Do any of you experience similar symptoms, and if so, how do you deal with them? I'm consistently losing sleep from how anxious I am when I wake up from these episodes."
636,First auditory sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,4,"I used to get SP back when I was struggling hard with anxiety, it never manifested visually or auditory. It was always behind or below me and I'd feel like I was being dragged along. Today I was dreaming I was at work (I work in a hall) and I heard a co-workers shoes squeaking on the floor and then it turned into full sprinting and then an incredibly loud rush that ended in a (quite stereotypical) demonic voice screaming ""I'm coming for you"". After not having it for years and never having experienced it that way it was terrifying to me and sent me into a panic attack, even though I knew exactly what it was.

I guess what I wanted to say was I have mad respect for those of you who get it auditory, because that was the worst experience I've ever had with it."
637,One hour of hell,Sleepparalysis,0,"Recently I got another episode SP. I’ve been getting the “demons” lately and for this episode I saw this lady, her eyes were huge and per pupils were dilated, skin very pale and very dry, her lips were barely non existent with blood stained on it, her teeth were yellow and very separated, and she had no eye lids. She was staring at me for an hour, she did not move her mouth, her teeth were clenched, and she never blinked. For the whole hour she was screaming at me, if I could describe the sound it gave similarity to the goat man screaming and a mountain lion screaming. During this whole process I was at the point of not breathing at all. I have this weird thing going on when I get scared my head shakes rapidly during SP so on and off my head would shake really fast but my body was stiff. After that episode I just turned to the other side shaking and hoping that when I turn around I won’t see her. I’ve also got some trauma from this I guess, because now that I’m terrified of the dark again I see faces when it’s total darkness. I hate using the word anxiety but when I’m in the dark my gut drops and my ears ring with my stomach just wanting to jump out."
638,First two nights sober,Sleepparalysis,2,"I spent Friday through Sunday night drinking and smoking and sleeping with someone else. Yesterday night and tonight were my first nights sober and I got some bad paralysis and nightmares. 

Just wanted to talk about it."
639,Oooold story,Sleepparalysis,0,"Decided that, since i found this subreddit, might as well share my one story of SP.

It was AGES ago, like around age 5 (so 16 years since oof), that this happened. It was outright textbook for the first bit. I has panicked a bit but not as much as when i looked into the doorway. Standing in it was basically the silhouette of someone. Stood there for a bit, idk how long tho. Obv being 5 this was already terrifying, but so much so that when it began to move towards me, my brain just noped out and i passed out. It was by far an interesting experience, and a tiny weird part of me wants it to happen again for a fresher memory of it but also id rather not have it again as well.

Short but eh, its the story."
640,Why do people experience vibrations during sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,20,"I get sleep paralysis semi-frequently (I'm fortunate not to have any terrifying hallucinations), and every time, I experience the sensation of my body vibrating, similar to a cell phone. It's accompanied by buzzing noises. However, it's not constant. It comes and goes like waves, occurring maybe once or twice a second. I can also normally wiggle out of it and wake myself up by moving the tips of my fingers to ""wake"" my body up.

Anyways, I've noticed that this is a very common hallucination, and I'm a very science-minded person, so I'm wondering if there's a specific reason why this hallucination is so common. What's physically going on in my brain when this happens? Is it a coincidence that others experience this also?

I have trouble finding any article that explains it to my liking, but one person on the internet explained that it could be due to the brain changing brain wave frequency while going into REM sleep, and in this state, I can hear the brain waves. I haven't found any scientific article explaining this, so I'm not sure if that's true."
641,My demon Lindy,Sleepparalysis,2,"2018 I was at a luau party and I slept over at my friends house. During sophomore year I would get sleep paralysis almost every night but never see the “demons”. Until that night, where I would usually get a tingling feeling near my left armpit. When I got SP I saw this pale white lady, orange hair, a white dress. I was hearing multiple tiny whispers that were inaudible but she was just staring at me for about 20 mins. I told my friend that hosted the party this year and he told me he has a painting of her that was hidden in the basement. He said he saw that girl when he was like 5 but it wasn’t that intense as mine. This Saturday I went back to that house and this time I only heard whispers for a solid minute and asked my friends if they heard the whispering too.... they didn’t."
642,My first sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,"I've experienced sleep paralysis once in my life and it was like 3 or 4 weeks ago

Anyway, it was a normal night when I was sleeping, I had a couple normal dreams until it was 3 or 4 am... It started by me in my room, alone, in the dark and suddenly, the room was full of flying figures which terrified me. I tried screaming mom Dad but it was useless so I tried figuring if it was a dream. Unfortunately, I was eyes wide open seeing these creatures float, then they all dissapeared except one that started getting closer and closer to me, I tried to scream with all I had but my screams were just barely whipers. Luckily, my dad was awake at the time just to go to the bathroom near my bedroom and go sleep. He heard my whispers and came into my room and as soon as he got in, the figure was gone. I was fully awake and did not even blink rich made me sure that was 100% a sleep paralysis

To be honest it still terrifies me to this moment and I get chills everytime I remember that scenery





EDIT: sorry if my english is bad cuz I'm an Arab"
643,"For the past hour, I’ve been going in and out of sleep paralysis",Sleepparalysis,2,"I’ve been trying to sleep for the past hour. Every time I start to dream, even a little whether it be seeing the dream or hearing it, I’m yanked into sleep paralysis. This is the worst my SP has ever been. I don’t know what to do. I’m exhausted. Any suggestions? I’ve already tried getting up and walking around."
644,First sleep paralysis in a very long time...,Sleepparalysis,1,"Five years ago, I had a problem with recurring sleep paralysis. I would have it almost every other night and sometimes, multiple times during the same night.  Coincidentally, it was during one of the lowest times of my life  — it was my senior year of high school so I was stressed and I was also spiraling into depression. It was such a traumatic time and the sleep paralysis just added to all of it. Nevertheless, my experiences with recurring sleep paralysis did not remain as frightening as they were in the beginning. I didn't have any visual hallucinations, almost always just in the pitch black darkness while the other times were in fleshy darkness (like looking through my eyelids, if that makes sense) if there's a light in my room. I did have some auditory hallucinations, but most notable was a ringing that kept on getting louder and louder and I thought that my head was going to explode. But after a while, it became more like a nuisance and just another stress because it kept me from getting needed sleep when I was already barely getting any because of my depression. Then, I found a solution: sleeping on my side rather than on my back. And just like that, my sleep paralysis went away. And so every night for the last five years, I slept on my side. 

Fast forward to two days, I had my first sleep paralysis in a very long time. I was sleeping on my side. And just like that, my security blanket was taken away. And not only that but it was the most frightening sleep paralysis I've had yet because of the visual hallucinations and how dream-like they seemed. And maybe, they were actually dreams  — because it began as that. I don't exactly remember all the details of my dream but it began with me having sleep paralysis (and so I thought I was having one) but then in that dream, I woke up and I can't remember more except that I was running out of my room only to stop because I saw a figure (made of shadow?). After seeing that shadow figure, I woke up except I was actually having sleep paralysis that time.  It was so frightening because I wasn't sure if I was still dreaming and the anxious person that I am, I immediately thought that I'd be stuck in that cycle forever. 

I don't know how to end this post but yeah, that's my first sleep paralysis in a very long time and definitely not looking forward to more. I also thought that the dream inception thing was me having an out-of-body experience or astral projecting but that's probably a reach lmao. Anyway, sleep tight y'all."
645,My sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,"I used to only get these episodes once every few years and thought it was like a guardian spirit telling me to be careful or watch out. Until I finally had a therapist tell me it was SP.  every time I get it.  I never see a figure.  I’m usually where I am but a hidden figure comes always out of my sight and lays on top of me.  Holding me down till I four el a muffled scream to wake me up. It’s started happening more frequently and I’ve started writing down every experience. Here’s my last one that really freaked me out. 

“When I sleep I have a tv on or music playing to help me drift off. I was dreaming before it happened no problems blend a nice pleasant dream.  Then it happened. I felt my eyes open and I was back in my room with my bed. I could see the tv as closed and opened my eyes the room changes. Lights went on in the dream and new furniture was in new places.  I felt my self drift more Into the dream world, as I did the harder it was to keep my eyes open.  I could still hear the tv playing from my room. I felt myself fall off of the bed and couldn’t get up in my dream, think of chest to the ground, legs up the side of the bed, with one ear planted to the floor...then I felt it first it was a hand petting my back then a body with a head by my ear.  I couldn’t see who but it felt different.  I called out my friends name “Carly” but no answer then I heard it speak in a deep guttural voice it said “feed me” I felt myself eying to push an internal scream out to wake up like I taught myself then I felt it.  It was a mouth sinking it’s teeth in my back.  I felt the sharp pain and it jolted me wake.  I took a few seconds to make sure I was awake and I was now I lay in bed slightly afraid to sleep right away but I know I will in a bit just have to come down. “"
646,Will I get SP?,Sleepparalysis,4,I have never had sleep paralysis but i’ve been reading about it and i it seems pretty spooky so i just want to know if I will most likely never have it if i haven’t for 16 years
647,6/29/20,Sleepparalysis,0,"When I get SP, I get it right when I’m about to sleep. Before I get SP I will get a tingling sensation on my left armpit, I was having it so I went to sleep just to get over it. First round I just had trouble breathing more than usual and I couldn’t open my eyes. Second round it was easier to breathe but I could barely move so it was really hard to wake up. Third round I had a tingling sensation all over my body and I couldn’t move again because Everytime I moved the tingling will get more sensitive. I was planning to sleep at 11:00 pm but instead I fell asleep around 3:00-4:00."
648,"[CW:Rape] I was ""raped"" during SP",Sleepparalysis,12,"this is a backstory: when i was 17 i was raped by someone i thought was a friend. it was in a different country and since then i've moved and for the most part i've been safe. 
I've experienced sleep paralysis a lot a few years back. i wanna be clear, i wasn't actually raped by another person while experiencing sleep paralysis, but i felt it. it was like a recreation of my actual rape which to say the least fucked me up. I've heard things, seen things and even was ""dragged"" by my ankle during sleep paralysis but never something like this, never this invasive. this was maybe a couple of years ago, i haven't experienced sleep paralysis since that one.

edit: i've experienced sp before being raped so it's not like it was a trigger or anything idk"
649,Time of sp,Sleepparalysis,2,"Hi, when do you experience sleep paralysis? Why is it that I experience it in the morning and not at night. Guess I would consider myself lucky to have non scary sp. The sun is up but I cant move can only look around my room."
650,Snake entity,Sleepparalysis,2,"I had an episode today due to lack of sleep and this is my 5th time having one. I have the normal episodes eyes open, unable to move, screaming no one could hear me, etc...But this time it was different, I was more aware that I was asleep and simply told my brain to calm down. That was all good until I felt and heard a snake. I didn't see it but I could feel it wrapped around my body leaving me paralyzed. I could very strongly hear the hissing in my ears and just before I woke up I felt it pierce my neck. I woke up flinching and that was it. This was my first time having an animal as my paralysis person and I just wanted to see if anyone else has had one too. Anyhoo thank u for reading"
651,Is this sleep paralysis or not?,Sleepparalysis,1,"Now typically people usually say during sleep paralysis you're unable to do anything but you see figures in your room or on your chest etc, so I'm unsure as to if I'm experiencing something different, usually when sleeping I will dream, now every night I always have lucid dreams but some nights I don't and am unable to control my dream, these usually play out as a story of a stranger and play snippets and details of their life, before suddenly I feel as if I'm awake and can't move, my vision turns red and the strangers face will be staring close at me before making a sound. For example one night I had this dream of a old looking Catholic woman in victorian clothing, I saw images of church's and other religious things, then suddenly out of nowhere it happened, I couldn't do anything I couldn't wakeup or move, my vision went red and see stared at me then screamed so loud, I was terrified I couldn't do anything until I managed to snap out of it and wiggle my finger which helped me gain control and wake up. I had a different story too, it was of a clown, down on his luck, getting nowhere and being fired from the circus, then my vision went red he stared at me and I heard demonic laughter, I couldn't do anything at all.

I'm sorry I'm rambling on but I'm genuinely unsure as to what this is. Now I don't see these figures in my room their in my dream, but I don't think it's a nightmare because I know when I have nightmares I can easily wakeup and move.

Feel free to ask me any questions. Thank you for reading."
652,My First Experience,Sleepparalysis,1,"I had my first sleep paralysis experience this morning. It’s my day off, and I wasn’t feeling well, so I was laying on my couch watching Seinfeld. I nodded off for about 15 minutes. I woke up to the sound of the door closing. I live with one other person. She and I are the only ones with the key.

I kept trying to open my eyes and I couldn’t. I tried pushing myself up and I couldn’t. Then I swear I felt a dog come up to me. The only pet in our house is a fish. And a man was telling the dog to leave me alone. That I was asleep. I kept trying to open my eyes or move and I couldn't. But somehow I knew the guy was my dad. My dad lives 1100 miles away though. But when he spoke the man transformed into like a smaller man with a thick Mexican accent?? Then he kinda laughed. Not like a creepy way. Like when you'd fall asleep as a kid in the car and your parents would carry you to your room and put you to bed. Like that vibe.

Then they left. And when the door was closing I was finally able to move and open my eyes."
653,Now im not so sure I will be ok when I die.,Sleepparalysis,3,"had paralyisis again this morning. Idk. I thought I was dead. I sat up and looked to my side and I was sitting right beside my body. I started to stand up and instead like floated up a few feet. Ive been through that before and I'm sure I left my body. When I spun to the doorway there was something dark like a shadow person in the doorway so all I could think was to lay  back down inside my body. Then I woke up and took a second to move any part of me but I could hear myself like gurgling sounds in my throat and when I sat up my lungs felt like they were going to explode they had like deflated and stayed there, it was a struggle to get air enough to get a full breath. Eventful little nap. Fuck"
654,Was that Sleep Paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,"Okay so I’ve had sleep paralysis a lot of times over the years and I kind of got used to them. Had several scary experiences but not too bad, especially considering what other people go through. But one instance that happened a while ago still kind of confuses me. I was sleeping on my side and I woke up and rolled onto my back and suddenly my breathing got really fast, and I felt a pressure on my chest and had an overwhelming feeling of fear, similar to my other sleep paralysis episodes. However, I didn’t feel paralyzed, I was still able to roll, so I rolled back onto my side and suddenly everything stopped, I felt normal, breathing slowed down and pressure was gone. Then I was confused so I rolled onto my back again so I could sit up and suddenly everything came back, the pressure, the fear, and I started breathing really fast. Needless to say I slept on my side the rest of that night but it still confuses me. It had all the elements of sleep paralysis, except I wasn’t paralyzed (Or if I was, it was for a few seconds, but not like my other sleep paralysis moments). 

Has anyone had a similar instance like this? It may not be sleep paralysis but idk what else it could be. It felt like this hotspot on my bed made me feel overwhelmingly scared, made my breathing erratic and placed a pressure on my chest."
655,Still scared af despite being well used to it.,Sleepparalysis,1,"Hi,
So I have GAD which is probably the main reason why I do a ton of sleep paralysis. I also occasionally take drugs for fun which tends to trigger it more and make it more intense. I'm turning 25 and I'd say it happens more or less regularly since around 10 years 

Back to my very first real long sleep paralysis I thought it was the scariest shit ever. Eventually i found out what it was and realised I had it many times before but different. Especially when I was working on lucid dreams experimenting, and nailed it, usually I would wake up in sleep paralysis. I remember a very very very scary early one where I saw my dream blinking with my room. I was focusing on trying to look at my hands cause it's supposed to be a technique to wake up, but I just couldn't..I felt like I would be stuck in the other dimension forever. After that I never tried to ""play"" with lucid dreams again but I had acquired skills in naturally being able to identify when I dream and how to wake up especially from nightmares.

After the first time once you really understand it, it's supposed to be less scary. There was a period of my life where I would do a sleep paralysis as soon as I would fall asleep on my back. After the use of drugs it would be almost as soon as I close my eyes. 

I got really used to the ""sober"" ones. When I'm starting to realize I'm doing a sleep paralysis, I learnt to not panic, I know how to react, I know what's going on, it's not nice but I can deal with it and usually I'm not too scared anymore.

These last few months it got rarer. I found myself many times sleeping on my back and not doing sleep paralysis which could never happen before.
_____________________________________________
So today I got drunk and fell asleep on my back.
I had a sleep paralysis, extremely short but intense.
I'm still shivering thinking about it, my heart is still racing. 
I suddenly felt like if I was on the top of someone who was closing their arms on my body holding me very strongly, the arms in the level of my neck, preventing me to breath, and I started to hallucinate about the wall in front of me, which made me understand I was starting a sleep paralysis. I felt like i was coughing blood and couldn't breathe in the same time and felt like if I was choking. I felt like if I was screaming, shaking, even tho I didn't feel like I was trying to cause I was aware it was a sleep paralysis and the attitude I know I must have is to stay calm. But it was so fucking intense, I felt an extremely violent freezing wind going through my body , I'm still feeling cold right now.  And yeah  the stuffs on my wall looked like a threatening humanoid thing starring at me. Omg I'm shivering so hard. 
Then... Then I managed to wake up. My light is on, I felt asleep like that. It's 2am. I'm not feeling like turning off the lights or trying to sleep straight away.
_________________________________________________

 So I thought I would check if there was a sleep paralysis community and share a bit my experience.

I used to think sleep paralysis could happen to me only when I'm on my back and when I slept alone but it happened in any circumstances. I have to say tho than in 99% of the cases I was on my back.
So if you have issues with sleep paralysis, even tho everyone is probably telling you the same, I just want to say, DO NOT sleep on your back. It's a real trigger. 

Yeah idk that's it for now maybe I'm gonna scroll on this sub and play some games maybe to relax lol.
Sleep paralysis are terrifying. Thanks for reading."
656,Experiences with sleep paralysis.,Sleepparalysis,0,When I was about 16 I remember I would get sleep paralysis about every day. Sometimes I would get it napping during the day or at night. I would always feel when it was coming and I would say to myself ah here we go again it’s gonna happen. Sometimes I would just lay there not baking able to move and I would fight whatever it was that felt like was overcoming me . One time I decided I was not gonna fight it and just let it take over me so I did that but the more I let it take over me i felt terrible so I immediately began to fight it again and try to move . There was times when I could here sounds so loud that they hurt my ears once I heard the sounds of dogs barking . Once I heard a demon growling or at least that’s what it sounded like. The last time I experienced sleep paralysis was a couple months ago after talking about it with a friend I later experienced sleep paralysis that same night .
657,Controlling sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,3,"This is probably a stupid statement/question, but since in lucid dreams, you can control what you see/the plots of it, why wouldn’t we be able to control what we see during sleep paralysis since you’re aware that it is? There’s probably science proving why you can’t, but it just got me thinking."
658,Frequent SP randomly goes away,Sleepparalysis,1,I had SP on and off before it became nearly a nightly thing randomly it just went away and I haven't had it for a nearly two months and I can't figure out why
659,Sleep paralysis or something else?,Sleepparalysis,4,"Hello,

When I was approximately 15 years old ( am 30 now), I experienced the sensation and have memories of being dragged along my floor from my bed while sleeping. I awoke later on in the AM in my bed with no ill effects and never had that particular sensation again, aside from sleep paralysis and the sensation of being watched and doors opening, people looking at me, etc. 

That sensation of being dragged along my floor has stuck with me as my all time weirdest occurence at night, and I have not seen anyone comment or post about anything like that. At the time I was listening to alot of black metal music, smoking and drinking and had a poor relationship with my family. Perhaps I was being visited by a demonic entity? Please advise, thanks"
660,Sleeping medication that do not induce/worsen SP?,Sleepparalysis,0,"Hi there! I occasionally have sleep paralysis. Besides that, for a very long time i've also been having trouble falling asleep at a reasonable time, often i won't fall asleep before 6 am so that greatly fucks up my day rhythm. 

To help me fall asleep in time, my doctor has prescribed me a benzodiazepine before; temazepam. However, trying this once became a total sleep paralysis fest; it was just 8 hours on-and-off sleep paralysis. So I was definitely not feeling rested in the morning (and to be honest was kind of traumatised.)

The only other things I've tried besides this are CBD (doesnt really help with sleeping in) and melatonin (also induced my SP, but less extreme than temazepam though.)

My question; is there anybody that also had this problem with temazepam (or maybe another benzodiazepine) but most importantly; does anybody have a good experience with a sleeping medication that did not induce/worsen their sleep paralysis? 

(Sleeping in is the main problem - once I'm asleep I'll sleep through the night perfectly well, luckily!). Really hope anybody has some suggestions and experiences to share, would love to have a proper sleeping pattern again."
661,Is this sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,0,"A few nights ago I kind of felt my body going to sleep, either that or I woke up the same time I was going to sleep and was paralyzed, but it last like a split second. I looked up why this could have happened and saw the thing about tricking your mind to think you’re asleep when you’re not, but as the idiot I am, I purposely tried this again. When I did I I felt a painful vibration, I assume this was just the feeling of entering deep sleep that I’m not suppose to feel, but it seemed I was going in and out of a dream.

Every time I focused on a specific object (in this case a game controller, not sure why, I’d enter this room full of bleachers, it was a lucid dream because I was aware that I was dreaming, but when I stopped focusing on said object, I appeared at the foot of my bed, couldn’t move, and it felt so real I was expecting my dad to come in and I’d had to explain that maybe I was sleep walking.

I focused on the object again, appeared back in this gym, but then when I stopped focusing, suddenly I was hanging from the ceiling, my tv was n the ground below me, and everything was out of my room besides the bed. So I started to freak out and was trying to force myself to wake up, I’d slowly be opening my eyes, but they felt glued shut, but it’s like I was seeing the dream world and real world simultaneously. 

Was this a rare form of sleep paralysis? Was I actually just paralyzed in my bed, but I hallucinated my whole room being completely different, and laying on the foot of my bed as I quickly switched between that and a lucid dream?"
662,witnessing sp,Sleepparalysis,0,"I just wanted to start off by saying that my dad was the one who was having SP, or at least i think it is. so i stay up later than my dad and was staying on the bed next to his when all of a sudden i heard him sorta groaning and mumbling. he was slurring his words, said a few things that wasn’t clear  but it sound like he was arguing for a few seconds, then i heard him try to say “wake... me... up” when i finally did i asked him what was he dreaming about and he told me that he wasn’t dreaming, he said that he couldn’t see, talk or move but he heard my brother and i talking on my bed (my brother wasn’t in the room). he never mentioned anything about feeling pressure on his body though but something similar happened when i was younger and sleeping in the same room. at that time he did feel like someone was pushing his body down while not being able to talk/move. i remember feeling so scared that night."
663,My Worst Experience,Sleepparalysis,1,"Several years ago I lived in a crappy makeshift apartment which was made out of the top floor of my girlfriend’s parent’s house. It was a really  run down old house in a dead industrial town in Pennsylvania. The apartment itself was basically a repurposed attic. It had the angled ceilings and those creepy little doors in the walls. There was no line for a stove in the “kitchen” and the walls were probably made out of asbestos. It was a really grim little place but we were so poor back then. We tried to make the best of it. My girlfriend told me that it was haunted but I didn’t really believe her at first. 

Anyway, one night we made a spot on the floor and stayed up all night watching movies. It must have been around 5 in the morning by the time I turned off the TV. My girlfriend was already fast asleep at this point but I still wasn’t tired. The birds were already chirping outside and the room was fairly bright from our dim little window. I figured I should try and get some sleep but I couldn’t keep my eyes closed. My restless mind ran over mundane chores that I had to do later, making an inventory in my mind. I wasn’t drifting off at all. I was just looking up at the sky, debating whether or not I should just get up and start my day. Then, I noticed something emerging up from under my blanket. I was immediately paralyzed. It looked like a hunched figure draped underneath my blanket near my feet. I watched in terror as the mass under the blanket slowly crawled up closer to me. I could feel a sort of twisted ball of limbs on top of my chest as it got to my torso. It was holding down my hands. This thing was almost up to my face when I felt a huge swell of courage in my chest. I still couldn’t move my body and my hands were still bound but I could feel my “soul’s” arm break free (if that makes sense). I was able to form a readied fist. The figure immediately stopped. It actually seemed taken aback. In that moment I wasn’t scared anymore. All of my fear melted away. I was ready for it to show some sort of burnt, gnarled, ugly face. I was ready to crush it back into dust with my imaginary fist. Then, something unexpected happened. In a split second it pushed up the rest of the way. Instead of a grotesque face that I could punch, a ton of swirling dark gray and black smoke rushed out and filled the entire room. The smoke completely blotted out the light from the window and it became dark as night in the room. At this point I lost my shit and started writhing (still paralyzed) trying to break free. Finally, in the snap of a finger it all stopped. I was laying there, just as before, looking out the window. The room was still. Same lighting, it was still early morning.  My girlfriend was still sleeping by my side. Time hadn’t passed. I had to literally pinch myself. It’s like I woke up but I was never asleep. This was exactly like one of those stereotypical dream sequences in a horror movie.  

At the time I rationalized that it must have been an extremely vivid dream. But looking back I don’t know. I’ve had very mild sleep paralysis before but it happened to me when I was drifting off to sleep or just waking up. There were never any entities and I just had to rock myself for a minute to break out of it. This was different. I just snapped into and out of a nightmare with vivid clarity and no memory of ever falling asleep. Perhaps it all actually did happen and I was just frozen with fear :-/"
664,I woke up from my SP dream into another SP dream.,Sleepparalysis,14,"Recently I keep having a spiral of SP dreams as the title states. So I’ll be in a SP dream only to “wake up” into another SP dream and so on. Last night I didn’t think it would end, I “woke up” about 4 or 5 times, by the end I was begging to wake up for real. After that I couldn’t get back to sleep, every time I felt myself drifting off I had to move my head just to make sure I wasn’t going into SP again, which of course led to no sleep.

Anyone else experience similar? Any way to combat this?"
665,Has anyone ever realized in a dream you were about to go into sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,7,"I’ve had it happen to me a few times before. I’ll feel like I’m about to faint or I feel like I’ve been drugged in a dream and then immediately I’m in paralysis. I’ve even had times where I’ve become lucid before it happens. I remember I was in a dream and began feeling incredibly weird. I told my brother in my dream “Shit, I think I’m about to pass out and go into sleep paralysis”. Sure enough I did. I can’t really describe the weird feeling I get in my dreams, I just feel like this really strong sensation in my body thats like I’m losing myself"
666,Can someone tell me wether or not I was having sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,3,So as of recently every night before I’ve gon to sleep I’ve choked the chicken and right after I’ve been falling asleep pretty easily but just two days ago I was told i would be going back home for like two weeks (Milwaukee Wisconsin). So with this time back home to see my family I thought maybe this would be a good time to take a break from my normal endeavors that I partake in every night before I go to bed so I get to my grand parents house after a two hour plane ride followed by a 4hr joy ride around town and I’m exhausted so I fall asleep and my first set of dreams are fine and since it was early when I fell asleep I ended up waking up at like 1 am so I stay up for about 2 hrs watching YouTube then I decide it’s probably time for me to go back to sleep. The thing about me is that if I’m forcing my self to sleep then I have to start thinking of random things and I have to make up stories in my head and then slowly but surely I’ll fall sleep. So after probably about 5mins of me doing that ( just an estimate because who can really tell time when trying to sleep) it works but I end up having really aggressive dreams about sex and they were sooooo vivid. Now this is normal because In the past I’ve tried to stop this unhealthy obsession and I’ve had dreams like this so it didn’t really stand out to me as something that weird the only difference is that this dream was a little stronger. So I wake up again but then I notice the air vent was on and it was blowing so cold so I clasped my hands together and put them in between my legs and layed on my side. I fell asleep but this time I felt like my eyes were open so I looked to the right of me and the pillow I was laying on was white and swirls shaped like a statue appeared from it and then I looked down the pillow and the same thing happened but this time a chicken appeared ( I have no idea why) but then I shifted my eyes to the left to look down at my feet and I realized I couldn’t move and in the room I’m in there’s a black spin chair in front of me but it looked it started to move and then a black shadow zipped across the room. I was terrified so I closed my eyes and woke up. Sorry for the long ass story but I just felt the need to give all the details so can anyone tell me what this was and if it was sleep paralysis?
667,"Experiencing double vision, extreme fatigue?",Sleepparalysis,1,"I’ve been getting SP very often these past two months, probably 3-4 nights a week and it happens over and over again throughout the night to the point where I just wake up at two AM and don’t go back to sleep. I used to be able to get up for an hour then go back to sleep but that’s not working anymore. I just keep going back into paralysis. 

Now I’ve noticed that when I force myself out of paralysis there is a period of time that lasts between 10-30 minutes where I experience double vision or an inability to focus my vision, blurriness and extreme fatigue to where if I stand I get vertigo and can’t walk straight, can’t keep my eyes open, and struggle to move my arms even though I’m fully awake and moving. I also have longer and longer periods after paralysis where I can’t think straight, like I could literally just stare at a wall for an hour and if someone spoke to me I probably wouldn’t register it. Has anyone else very had anything like this? It freaks me out and I know I’m really losing sleep but I dread it now."
668,Paranoid about falling asleep,Sleepparalysis,4,"I used to get sleep paralysis all the time when I was really little. Back then, there were no hallucinations or anything. It was just mildly annoying because I couldn’t move for a few seconds after I woke up. I hadn’t had an episode in maybe 6-8 years, however, in the last few weeks, I’ve been experiencing sleep paralysis pretty frequently. This time, there have been hallucinations, and they’ve been pretty intense. So far, it’s only been limited to sensory (a feeling of being held down in bed, someone putting their hands on me, etc.) and auditory hallucinations (several voices speaking/ laughing incoherently behind me, one voice in particular usually whispering but sometimes shouting my name). These experiences have gotten gradually more intense. The first few were even kinda cool and fun to tell my friends about, but now it’s not fun at all and actually pretty terrifying. I legitimately am afraid I would have a panic attack or something if they get any worse and I see some shadow monster or creepy kid standing at the foot of my bed. I know this might be a dumb question, but can anyone here pass on their advice for overcoming this fear of sleeping? Better yet, is there any real way to stop this? 
Any help is appreciated."
669,"Sleep Paralysis, but was able to struggle and move",Sleepparalysis,1,"I believe I experienced my first ever dose of SP today, but it seemed rather unusual with what I’ve heard from the community. 

It began with being unable to open my eyes. It felt as though my eyes had crust in them or something and were stuck together. I struggled for about 5-10 seconds to open them while moving my head, but my arms were unable to move to help during this time. I was finally able to open my left eye and suddenly I was frozen with one eye open and the left side of my head against my pillow. In that moment I felt pressure on my bed like someone was sitting right next to me where I was looking. Even saw the bed sink in.

I began taking deep breaths and realized somewhat that I was dealing with SP, but everything was strikingly real. After a few moments of taking deep breaths and struggling to move the pressure next to me subsided and I was able to throw my right arm over my body towards the edge of my bed. Then I was frozen again for a few seconds and felt that whatever it was, was in the far right corner of my room now. I was unable to see it due to my right eye being unable to open and where it was being just out of sight. 

After trying very hard to open my right eye I was able to move my right arm. Which I used to appropriately give the area where the thing was the middle finger while yelling “fuck you bastard!” This allowed my body more freedom to move in a kind of delayed for a second jerky motion. I used this to climb out of bed in an attempt to open my electric powered blinds on my window (it was day time). 

When reaching the window by jerkingly crawling to it I was unable to remember which side the button was on and realized I was dreaming again. I had to resort to putting my eye near the crack in the blinds, but once again whichever eye I got close to the light would be closed. I thought to myself “this is some bullshit I can’t even get light in this nightmare?” And then I woke up laying in the exact position where this experience started.

I wasn’t afraid when I woke up, just groggy and disoriented. I find the experience fascinating and my reaction to the perceived threat somewhat funny. I don’t believe in demons, but any explanation or classification of this experience would be awesome! 

It seemed like a lucid dream with some SP symptoms I was fighting against.

Thanks 🤙🏻"
670,Is there a reason I've been getting sleep paralysis for over 10 years?,Sleepparalysis,3,"I remember my first sp episode, I was in like 8th grade and I couldn't move, I could see my door and it was banging so hard that I can see the door move with every pound. I snapped out of it and brushed it off. Then through out high school I'd get it maybe once or twice a month. Now for the past 3-4 years I've been getting sp at least twice a week. Sometimes it's really bad, like 5 times a week. Before I would see things, usually the same ""person"". But I would say that 80% of the time I just can't move, get a horrible pain in my gut, and I feel like i'm just watching myself. I can see myself struggling to wake up.
Im pretty much used to it now but there are times I still panic.
Is it like a disorder or something? I heard it's related to stress but it's been acting up more these past years, even though I'm happier then I was before."
671,Strange episode,Sleepparalysis,3,"I had a strange sleep paralysis episode a year ago or so where I was awake, I heard that loud humming noise as usual, but instead of seeing a figure or anything like that, I “fell” out of my bed and could see under my bed and everything. I never hit the ground, I instead levitated a couple inches above it. Eventually I woke up/was able to move again and was extremely confused for a few seconds because I thought I had fallen. My eyes were open during the whole thing, too.

Has an experience like this happened to anyone else?"
672,Sleep paralysis.,Sleepparalysis,3,"Any advise for someone with sleep paralysis.like how to stop it. I just woke up after six false awakening's and it is really concerning me. I felt like i couldn't breath. I also feel mentally drained I am struggling to type this even. Its like my hands won't cooperate with my mind. And i feel so foggy and mentally drained. I hope this makes sense and, please forgive my bad grammar. Goodnight reddit."
673,What is my sleep paralysis demon?,Sleepparalysis,0,"So I haven't had it in a few weeks but my last one was of me waking up and knowing it was sleep paralysis, then I was able to move my legs and at the foot of my bed I saw a child with the face of pure evil. The thing is I wasn't scared though, it reminded me of the ""thrill"" of when my dad was still alive since iv'e felt kind of numb since he died years ago (think of it as life or adrenaline). I could crawl on my bed and as I got close I still wasn't afraid. I called to my dad and reached my hand out and at that moment I woke up. Can anyone give me any insight?"
674,Terrifying experience last night,Sleepparalysis,2,"Sleep paralysis is nothing new for me, and usually when it happens I recognize it for what it is and have even used it as a path to lucidity. Last night was different. I never felt as if I was fully asleep. I often get stuck in ""half sleep"" for lack of a better term. It felt as if people were in the house and were planning to attack me. I couldn't see them, but I could hear them. I screamed multiple times, at least one of which was a real scream because it woke up my husband who was sleeping in another room last night, trying to get a decent night's sleep, lol. I kept having false awakenings. Not sure how long this went on, but it felt like hours. Finally I actually woke up and got out of bed to fully wake up before trying to sleep again.

I'm scared to go to sleep tonight. Does anyone have any tips? Commiseration is fine too!"
675,New Parent Sleep Paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,It has happened every night for months now. My baby has slept in her own room since 4 months but I keep dreaming that she’s in the bed with us. I can’t move to wake up and grab her. I often hear her or feel her moving around the bed when she’s not there. My mental health is really suffering from the constant since of panic I feel. Any other new parents out there that experience something similar?
676,Rare sleep paralysis as a kid.,Sleepparalysis,2,"I know it is rare to have sleep paralysis as a kid but my age was 9 years old I had my own room and my friends as a child would tell me scary stories I freaked out! As I was going to sleep Every night I would hear noises from the room next to me.A couple of nights later I could hear screaming and I really wanted to know what it was but I was too scared to move.I told my parents that I could hear screaming at night but they told me to not think much of it.

The week later I could see the window smash in my dreams but I didn't know if it was sleep paralysis or just magic because the night after, the window smashed and it lead to me thinking whether its sleep paralysis or not."
677,My sleep paralysis experience,Sleepparalysis,1,"I was having those episodes of sleep paralysis for about 5-6 years that stopped about 3 years ago.
I was recently discovered that it's a thing.. and not a personal experience I had so I wanted to share my experience and get some people who experienced the same thing maybe to help me figure what was it all about.

My most intense sleep paralysis experience was about 5 years ago at the age of 25.
I woke up in my room and saw my digital clock saying it's 3:33.
Then I saw two shadow figures standing to my left right on the side of the bed, they seemed to be talking with other since the left one had his head towards the one to his right.
They were made of shadow but had a ""laser"" like blue light surrounding them on the edges.. like a border.
I was trying to scream so bad, I couldn't move which what I had experienced in previous sleep paralysis but this was something else.. since I saw those figures.
I tried really hard and was able to lift my head jus t a lil bit above the pillow and moved my leg left and right at this point the left shadow was turning his head instantly toward me, both of them looking at me although was madeof shadow they both seemed surprised that I was able to move. Then at the same point the left one was putting a hand on my face and leg putting my head back on the pillow and moving my leg back into the bed. At the same time I woke up terrified..and saw the digital clock was 3:34.

I turned on the lights and was going to sleep with lights on for 2 years.. until I met my wife which had me to turn them off.
I did have more then a few sleep paralysis experience since.. but this was the most intense one.

Did anyone experience anything similar? With those kind of shadow figures with blue laser border? That's something which I carry for years trying to understand what happened. I was to thinking it was an hallucinations, but since a lot of people experience this, Im not so sure.about it anymore."
678,Lucid Dreaming for SP,Sleepparalysis,0,Would anyone be interested in learning Mindfulness Based Lucid Dreaming here? I’m hoping to shed light on SP and help people reframe the experience from something horrible to something interesting and fun.
679,Painful sleep paralysis experience,Sleepparalysis,3,"I've had sleep paralysis for about a year now it usually comes and goes but for the first few months of having it it would become an increasingly worse experience and would be nightly the worst experience I had, I had fallen asleep and gotten sleep paralysis and I would always experience drowning as I fall asleep to the point it would feel like I was taking my last breath( I believe this was related to nearly drowning as a kid I believe the memory was locked in my brain which is why it always felt so real) but I fell asleep and throughout the night I got sleep paralysis I think I got it like 5 times each time I would wake up to it feel like I was drowning then fall back asleep. I remember the more it happened the more I became mixed up in if I was awake or asleep I kept feeling like the time was changing once I looked at my clock and it was 5 then Id look back a few minutes later but it was really 3 I got so freaked out I had to text my friend to figure out what time it was. After a few of my regular experiences of sleep paralysis it started changing I would wake up to it and It felt like someone was taking their hand and shoving it through my skull and wrapping it around my brain and was trying to pull my brain out of my head it was the most pain I've ever experienced in my life and it's terrifying to know it was all in my head and not real, that my brain could even not only process but create that much pain to itself. It got to the point I felt like I was going insane."
680,SP while sleeping on my stomach,Sleepparalysis,0,"I'm back in my home country after completing an exchange program abroad. The trip took almost a whole week due to how spread out flights are right now. It was stressful and I'm glad it's over now. 

Last night I slept in my childhood bed for the first time in months. I was falling asleep on my stomach when I realised I'm heading towards SP. It happened four or five times in a row because I was too disoriented to immediately change position after getting out of it. For some reason, my mouth was open the entire time and I can feel drool trickling out as I lay there motionless lol. But I was finally able to break the cycle and moved to my side, and I slept like a baby after that."
681,is it normal to only get episodes when I have unsettling dreams?,Sleepparalysis,2,"so, when I was about 6-7 years old I had my first episode. I had a really unsettling nightmare about getting bit by a snake and dying on the spot after telling someone. I got really scared so I tried to alert my mom (we were on vacation so we were sleeping together) and she noticed.

now, last night I had my second episode. this time I was calmer since I had no idea what was going on because I was having a weird ass dream. on the side, I don't have sleep paralysis demons and I feel like it's weird, is this normal?"
682,Dying every night while I sleep because of PTSD from tripping,Sleepparalysis,13,"After having a very intense ego death on psychedelics, every time I try to sleep I now have sleep paralysis. Since my brain can’t come to terms with being paralyzed, it makes up a dream to understand this phenomenon. In the dream I always die, and have to remember to be alive in order to wake up. I told my psychiatrist what was going on and she prescribed me Prazosin for the nightmares. I’ve been on it for about 2 weeks and so far it’s done nothing but help me forget my dreams. But the problem with forgetting them is that I’m now having flashbacks to the dreams during the day. Does anyone have any advice on what to do to make the sleep paralysis dreams easier to manage? Anything helps."
683,Worst one yet,Sleepparalysis,1,"I’ve suffered from sleep paralysis for about 5 years but I experienced the worst episode yet last night. 

Normally, the setting of my sleep paralysis dream is just in the room I’m in, but this time I was dreaming of being in a vacation home with my parents. The dream started pretty normally. We were just settling into the house and when it was time to sleep, it turned for the worse. There was a dark presence and I almost recognized instantly that I was dreaming. I screamed bloody murder for help and that did nothing. I told myself over and over, “this isn’t real” but that’s when it got violent.

The dark presence pulled me to the ground off my bed and dragged me. The part that stood out to me the most was this cold feeling spreading over the back of my head to the top, like my head was bleeding. It was so cold and felt so real. I’m getting goosebumps and a little teary eyed thinking about it. 

This time, I really felt like I was dying and that this was hell. I was beginning to accept that I was dead. It was taking too long to wake up, so I was certain this was it.
I tried to steady my breathing but it wasn’t helping. So I hyperventilated and woke up finally. Drenched in sweat. I actually didn’t cry when I woke up. I was unable to comprehend what happened until later."
684,i think i had sleep paralysis last night.,Sleepparalysis,1,"it was seven o'clock and i was really tired so i went to sleep and woke up 4 hours after, i thought my sleep was round so i tried to go to sleep, then i was in a dream and suddenly i saw a man in a corner and i was lying down tried to move my hand but i couldn't it felt like pins and needles,but i could close my eyes,i felt intense pressure and anxiety the way you feel on a roller coaster and it went away after a few seconds an then i woke up. Is this actual sleep paralysis and will it happen again?"
685,"Sleep Possession, Paralysis or Psychosis?",Sleepparalysis,2,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but something very scary happened to me last night.

I went to sleep at around 10 PM as usual, and I woke up at 3:33 AM exactly as I checked my phone, as you do. I then went back to sleep straight after but then I woke up yet again and I looked at the time and it was still 3:33, but I thought I had just had some sleep. That's when the shadow came.

There was a dark, almost demonic figure in my head that was thrashing around going crazy. There was no sound and it had no face, but it just kept shaking itself from side to side viciously, as if it had something on it it was trying to shake off. It all got too real for me and after what felt like hours, I texted a friend of mine at 3:35, only two minutes since it began.

I somehow finally got back to sleep and had a weird dream but that's normal for me, and I woke up at around 8 but I felt like I had a concussion or something. I went to the bathroom and I looked at myself and I honestly couldn't recognise myself. I usually have quite a happy demeanour, but right now I can barely smile, I'm really confused and I still have a headache.

I should also mention that I have a history of acute psychotic episodes and various mental health issues but in my 22 years, I've experienced nothing like this.

Do I need to contact a Priest or a psychiatrist?

Thank you all for your help."
686,Last night's was different,Sleepparalysis,1,"So, I regularly experience sleep paralysis. Maybe once a month, which I guess might not seem regular to some but will to others?
Anyway, normally my experience is always the same, i wake but can't move or make any sound. And the shadow figure is always either stood in the doorway or at the foot of my bed watching me. Usually I recognise what's happening and can just ride it out, controlling my panic with deep breathing until it lifts and I can move.
But last night was a totally new and seriously scary experience. It started with a dream about walking into a sort of walk-in closet and bumping into what I thought was my friend who started laughing at me. Then everything changed, the background fell away and my friend sort of morphed into the shadow figure as the walls of the closet were replaced with the walls of my bedroom. This I presume was me 'waking'.
But this time instead of being at the foot of my bed, the shadow figure was stood right beside me and started to press down on my right shoulder (I should add I was sleeping on my left side facing my wife)
I could see it behind me and feel the pressure increase on my shoulder and chest. I couldn't breathe and I absolutely fucking panicked. Instead of  doing my usual calm breathing I went into full panic mode and tried desperately to yell or poke/prod my wife to 'wake' me and get rid of it. It felt like I was being crushed by an immense weight which is one of my biggest fears hence the absolute panic and absence of clear thinking.
Eventually it eased off and it felt like I was pushing through ever thinning mud or something as my muscles started to finally respond and I could sit up.
I'm not normally bothered by these experiences but the complete sweve of behaviour from my shadow figure has me a bit rattled.
Anyway I thought I'd share this particular incident with ya'll just because of the change in narrative.

Sleep well folks."
687,SP worsens with more stress than usual? Stop breathing during SP?,Sleepparalysis,6,"I had a bout of sleep paralysis last night and after waking in my usual panic attack, it dawned on me that my episodes happen every time I'm stressed out more than usual. I have several mental and physical issues that keep me stressed constantly but it's only when more stress is stacked on top of that that my SP increases. I also find my other sleep issues increasing during very trying times. Does anyone else have this experience.

Also, during SP, not only can't I move or speak, but I can't breathe. My last severe episode, I was face down in a pile of pillows, unable to move or breathe, yet I was conscious that I couldn't. I knew that if I didn't breathe soon, I was in danger of suffocating, heightening my panic since suffocating is the biggest phobia I have. Anyway, I just wanted to know if anybody experiences the inability to breathe during their episodes."
688,Weird experience x 2,Sleepparalysis,2,"I have never had sleep paralysis before, or at least nothing like this that I can think of...

Twice now I have had a dream (these have been during middle of the day naps) where I wake up in the dream and half of my face is paralyzed and I can’t see... the only thing I can see is a fixed vision. I can’t remember what it was last time, but this time it was my bedroom wall and window... which is the way that I was facing so it is possible that my eyes were open. 

I am still dreaming though, so I keep trying to reach for my phone to call someone and it’s like I can not see my phone screen. I move it in and out of my field of vision but I can not see it. 

And I also am trying to wake myself up through this, knowing it’s a dream. In the dream I kept screaming for my daughter to come help me because I clearly couldn’t see and couldn’t move... 

When I finally come out of these it’s a feeling of “thank god it’s over” but also still feel very panicked. 

What do you think?"
689,I thought I was dying last night,Sleepparalysis,1,"I get very frequent SP, but last night's episode was different than anything I had experienced in the past.

I sleep on my stomach to avoid sp. last night I woke up not being able to breath. I got tested for covid yesterday too, so before my brain even REGISTERED that I was in sleep paralysis, I felt a terror that I haven't felt since my first couple of episodes years ago. I couldn't breath, and it felt like my lungs were completely constricted. It felt like I was trying to gasp for breath through a coffee straw. When I snapped out it, I was able to breathe again. I'm a dumbass and had the same type of episode 2-3 more times because I went back to sleep without totally waking up. If I get sp, usually I get it back to back.

I honestly cannot describe how scary it was. I have seen monsters, I have felt the sensation of free falling, i've felt hands, i've heard screaming... I thought I had seen the worst of it, but this was different. When I woke up, I didn't even KNOW I was in SP. I tried yelling for help, but I couldn't breathe. I was just laying there fully expecting to black out and die last night. It was extremely upsetting."
690,Progressively getting worse,Sleepparalysis,1,First my arms would just freeze up and I could move my head.. then The next day I couldn’t move ANYTHING... last night I literally felt an entity pulling my shits off super fast.. is this normal
691,Terrifying SP experience. All of my senses sort of short circuited. Anyone else have this?,Sleepparalysis,5,"Asleep in my bed I seemingly wake up from an odd smell, a sort of disgustingly sweet mens cologne, nothing I had smelled before. I thought I heard footsteps and peek at the cracked open doorway. That's when I realize I can't move and initially I thought I was paralyzed by dear because it definitely sounded like someone was behind the door, creeping into the room. I could hear footsteps and see a shadowy figure approaching. I try to scream and wake my bf up who is next to me but nothing. I see the shadowy figure directly next to me and I think omg omg. He reaches for me and I feel the crushing sensation and all of a sudden my vision goes completely black and my ears deaf. Like everything violently turned off..eyes, ears, smell, touch, everything... I figured I was dying and thought to myself just let it happen, this is how I die, nothing I can do. Then I hear this inexplicable screaming in my head. Like a thousand voices, high and low, not of my own, screaming at once. 

After what feels like 10 mins but is ultimately seconds I am able to move again and immediately start hyperventilating. My Fitbit is recording my HR at 120 and my freaked out bf tries to calm me down. My overwhelming sense of a presence in the room does not go away and I'm stuck unable to sleep and essentially lay there crying and shaking all night. 

I've only had sleep paralysis and night terrors maybe once or twice in my life but nothing even close to this experience. This one rocked my world and will inevitably haunt me forever. I'm rather spiritual and also an empath so I'm not sure if this charge of energy perception has something to do with my experience but I just wanted to post this and see if anyone else has had these olfactory or auditory hallucinations? Like all my senses short circuited at once."
692,Lucid dream then sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,4,"This morning I woke at around 6:30am with about 4 and a half hours of sleep, I got up for breakfast at about 8:30am then went back into bed and fell asleep at 9:30am. I don’t know if any of that matters but anyway ahaha. I started lucid dreaming, not being able to control my dream but still partly being awake and conscious while dreaming but not fully awake. The lucid dream was very confusing, but it then turned into sleep paralysis. A spider about 15cm in width and length was crawling on my ceiling. I remember feeling intense stress and just not feeling relaxed at all. This all happened in the space of 30-40 mins. Wondered if anyone has experienced anything like this or if anyone has any tips or whatever."
693,My First Ever Sleep Paralysis Experience,Sleepparalysis,5,"I should start by saying I’ve probably only had sleep paralysis about 5 or 6 times in my life but the first one will always stick with me.  It was how I first learned what SP was because I was so convinced that I had just had a supernatural experience with some kind of entity that I went to tell a friend what had happened and he told me that it was probably just SP.  I had never heard of it beforehand. 

Anyways about 12 years ago I was living in Boston and had gotten into a fight with my ex at the time. Needless to say I was sleeping downstairs on the couch.  I can’t remember if I was already asleep or if I was falling asleep but all of the sudden I heard a soft whisper in my ear...”Hey.”  I could feel the breathe in my ear and I opened my eyes startled.  I laid there motionless wondering if there was an intruder in the house until I realized if that were the case they probably wouldn’t have tried to wake me up.  I could feel someone standing over me behind the couch and the energy in the room was very heavy and negative.  This is when I realized I was in a bad situation.  I didn’t know what was behind me but I could feel it’s presence and knew it was malevolent.  At this point I thought to myself “ok I’ll just play dead and act like I’m still asleep. Whatever is behind me doesn’t even know I’m awake.”  And so I laid there for a few more seconds (which felt much longer) until I realized whatever was behind me wasn’t going to leave.  I decided I had no choice but to face it head on so I said “fuck it I’m going to turn around and deal with whatever is there”.  This is when the whole ordeal took a weird/terrifying turn.  I was on my side and started to spin around and the moment I did I felt a hand grab onto the back of my neck.  It was so violent, hostile and strong that the first thing I thought was “what is this????”  I’ll never forget that thought shooting across my mind.  It was like I suddenly realized I was completely out of my element and whatever had a hold of me was something bigger than I had ever known.  My body was shaking and I felt this pulse running through me.  I tried to scream but, of course, could not and then all of the sudden *poof* it let go....I was awake sitting up and alone in the living room. The hair on my arms was standing up and I was terrified.  I was convinced I had just been attacked by some spirit because I had no idea what SP was back in 2008.   Like I said I’ve had it happen a few more times over the years but nothing as impactful as that.  I’ll never forget it."
694,How I prevented and cured Sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,6,"I had experiences with SP twice and it was scary to watch the shadows in human form move, but now I don’t have that problem because I pray to Jesus Christ every night before bed and he does it.

Before you say  you are stupid that is fake,give it a try  . Everytime when you are in trouble(not just only when you have SP) pray to Jesus and say God please help me in your mind . Use your own words from your heart  and head  and read The Bible  as much as you can . This is what helped me to cure SP and prevent it in future.I hope it will help you as much it does to me. Tell me what happend"
695,Something different.,Sleepparalysis,3,"I have been experiencing something different from your general sleep paralysis. At this point, I am unsure if it's even sleep paralysis. I have posted about this some time ago but only 1 person replied and it didn't help me identify it.

So it goes like this. I wake up. Try to stand up and feel the ground with my feet and the bed with my hands and bum. But my vision is set in stone. Even if I move around my vision is the same thing. The wall that I was looking at when I woke up. It might sound a bit confusing but imagine you are blind but instead of seeing nothing, you see the last frame that your eyes have seen. Ugh... I am unable to explain this but if anyone knows what it is please comment."
696,Sleep paralysis at 3:30 (Anyone Else?),Sleepparalysis,3,"I’m 18 years old and I live with my grandma, auntie, and older cousin. I was sleeping with all of the lights off inside the house and it was quiet. I fell asleep with my window opened, and on my back. Literally at 3:30am I felt like I woke up but I couldn’t move or talk. It just felt weird, like my body felt weird or it felt fuzzy. I knew exactly what was happening because I’ve had sleep paralysis once before so I tried to remain calm and not panic. It’s up until the point where I heard noises from outside my window and I heard a little girl or a kid crying out in the living room and that’s where I tried so hard to move but I couldn’t. I tried so hard just to move my fingers or my arms but couldn’t. It was until I took a deep breath and I forced myself to sit up as fast as I could and I felt like something was off in my room. So I immediately locked both doors of my house, turned on the lights and had my best friend come over. It is a reminder why I never like sleeping on my back, for that reason. This happened about an hour ago and it is currently 4:18am. I’m going to try to go to bed again, it’s just I didn’t like how I woke up at 3:30am. Has anybody else had sleep paralysis around 3am and have a little girl or hear noises?"
697,Sounds gets 200% or more higher in sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,15,"Hello, everybody. 

I have SP since i'm 11 or 12, today i'm 21 and still have this about 3 or 4 times a week. I always noticed that when I get stuck in sleep paralysis the sound gets 200% higher most of times driving me crazy. 

For example, one day I was sleeping on the couch watching to Dragonforce Live show, I fell asleep and got stucked in a sleep paralysis. The TV sound was normal, but at SP the sound was 1000% higher in my head, i felt so bad about it. Today, i was taking a nap when i got stucked and had one like this. It hurts my head everytime. 

Does anybody have the same problems?"
698,Does anyone expierence this too?!,Sleepparalysis,4,"I had SP this morning and thought nothing of it. When i woke up, i thought i heard my mom and my little brother laughing in the background, so I just went back to sleep. When I closed my eyes, i was talking to my deceased Grandpa and he was telling me, to tell my mom that everything is ok here. And every question I asked or he answered, I felt a heavy press on my body. First my chest, legs, arms and then face. I then woke up in straight panic not being able to move. I tried calling for my mom to help me but only whispers came out. When I snapped out, my face was numb and so was my body, I also was experiencing a tingling in my face as if I woke up in the middle of the night dehydrated. And I later found out my brother wasn't even awake yet. Who knows, I could've been the demon's talking. Please leave a comment if you experienced a hallucination like that, or felt pressure on your face too.

Thank you for reading :)"
699,I think I had my first Sleep Paralysis Experience last night.,Sleepparalysis,2,"Okay, so I don’t know if this was sleep paralysis or not, but from what I’ve seen I’m pretty sure it was. So I was having this weird dream (like any normal night) where I’m talking to this guy on a rooftop, then suddenly we’re in an old abandoned house. When I say abandoned, I mean it’s rotten wood everywhere windows busted out, that kind of abandoned. Then all of the sudden, the guy is gone and there is this little girl standing there. She turns around and she has these black holes where her eyes and mouth should be. Her skin is dry and cracked like she’s been dried out for years. I forget what she said, but she starts asking questions and insulting me. I went to go say “Fuck You Bitch!” but as I did, all of the sudden I’m in my bed laying there. I’m on my back looking at the foot of my bed and there is these two tall, skinny black figures standing at the foot of my bed. I’m trying to yell, punch, kick, anything but I can’t move and all I hear is the figures chanting “Fuck You Bitch!” All of the sudden, the entire room starts shaking and my vision gets all fuzzy and wobbly and the chants get louder and turned into shrieks. All of the sudden I woke up punching, kicking, and yelling. I was able to finally calm down (thanks to my dog being concerned for me and coming over to me) and went back to sleep, but that’s my sleep paralysis story."
700,How I cured SP with this simple trick and why do we have nightmares ( chances are 95% you are not going to like this ),Sleepparalysis,3," I had experiences with SP twice and it was scary to watch the shadows in human form move, but now I don’t have that problem because I pray to Jesus Christ every night before bed and he does it.

Tell me what happend"
701,Is it weird?,Sleepparalysis,9,"Is it weird that I enjoy sleep paralysis? Sometimes I just try to wake up in the middle of the night just to experience another SP. Although it is kinda scary, I like it and I look forward to every SP. I think of it as something new, something I can't experience in my everyday life"
702,I’m glad I listen to metal,Sleepparalysis,3,I’ve had a couple of spe when I was like 8 but when i started listening to metal i for some reason stopped having sleep paralysis. Can anyone explain this.
703,strange sleep paralysis experience,Sleepparalysis,2,"so yesterday i had a strange sp experience... i remember the tail end of my dream before i woke up. i was in a room, it kinda felt cozy and lived in with a warm lamp light lighting the room... there was a closet at the end of it.... i cant recall every being in this room before... my back was turned towards the closet, i was talking about something (cant recall what it was about or if i was talking to some one else in the room) and then suddenly i sensed a presence behind me coming from the closet. it apperently sense my awareness and tried to flee but i reach out as it pass me and was some how able to wrap my arms around it in a bear hug... it was desperately trying to wriggle out of my grasp and the movements seemed to slow wake me up. it was like a slow transition from dream to reality that blended from one into the other. first thing i noticed was the presence right right next to my head... it felt exactly like the presence in the dream. and i was lying on my bacck with my arms hugging my crossing each other around the right side of my chest. i swear i could feel that i was hugging something to myself... i tried to move but i couldnt budge... i could hear a sort of faint wooshing (or white noise) sound right next to my right ear ... i assumed it was coming from what ever i was hugging... it was beginning to frighten me... i tried to scream... nothing came out at first but i could feel it welling up inside of me before it burst out and i could suddenly move again... the entity i was hugging was gone too... it was so strange.

&#x200B;

anyone have anything similar happen to them?"
704,The worst sp experience I’ve had.,Sleepparalysis,1,"I’m sleeping on my right side right and suddenly it becomes hard to breathe, when I’m sleeping on my right side and happen to be looking at my phone then it starts.

First it’s the voices the whispering ones they aren’t saying anything that I can understand and they’re fast and frequent it’s like a thousand people talking to me at once.

Then it was a furry claw I felt something or someone come behind me but I couldn’t turn around I could only use my vision by looking to the side of me was a furry claw that placed itself on my shoulder I didn’t know what it was because I couldn’t see it

At this point I’m freaking the hell out and then the worst of the worst happens.

You realize that I was looking at my phone right ? All of a sudden a message comes up with three words 666 and the message just kept spamming “Let me talk to you, Let me talk to you, Let me talk to you”

I gained control of my body and everything was normal again it was still creepy ash"
705,Sleep Paralysis or something different???,Sleepparalysis,4,"I haven’t had sleep paralysis in a few months and tonights experience was different from what i’m used to. Questioning if it was SP at all. When I woke up it definitely had the same vibe as when I get SP I couldn’t really move or speak and I was immediately scared. I usually keep my eyes closed when I get it to avoid seeing anything that’s not really there, but this time I kept them open but my vision was still blocked off.. It was really strange i could see certain areas of my room but when i looked in others it would just be blank... what freaked me out is that I felt like there was someone in my room and I would only lose my vision when I would look in the direction I thought they were in.. and i wouldn’t fully lose my vision bc i could still recognize my room around me from my peripheral but i couldn’t see what was right in front of me. To clarify my closet is right across my bed and the doors were open and the light was on so I could clearly see around my room it wasn’t pitch black or anything. I started screaming hard, but of course that didn’t matter as nothing really came out although I could hear the screams in my ears like when you’re under water so I wondered if maybe something, anything was coming out. I kept screaming and looking around and eventually I gained the ability to move my arms and started banging them on the wall behind me hoping my roommate might wake up and come get me out of this but nothing. It goes on i’m screaming trying to move and break out of this and i feel like my roommate came in I can sense someone standing by my door and the figure vaguely resembles her from out the corner of my eyes but I can’t see her when I looked in her direction it’s blocked out. Still i felt like it was her and i think finally she heard me and came to help but they are just standing there and again any time i tried to look at her I couldn’t see so im just screaming for help and telling her “i can’t see i can’t see” which is weird bc usually you can’t talk but it felt like the words were actually coming out but i can’t know for sure bc my sense are all messed up and i don’t know what the believe. But if i was actually making any noise im sure my roommate actually would have ran in freaking out. But anyway this figure i perceived to be her never moves it just stays there, i’m never able to really see them and I realize it probably isn’t her. Eventually I am able to move a bit more and i’m getting ready to try and fall out of my bed hoping that’ll end this but then BAM the minute I turn over i see something (someone?) right in front of my face and before im able to process what it was i’m out of it. I immediately sit up, let out another scream and calmed down. One of the first things I usually do when I get out of SP is get on my phone and of course it was 3:30 am... and even weirder earlier in the night around 10pm I was in and out of sleep on the couch with my roommate and heard a loud sigh and it sounded like it said something but it was really distorted and I couldn’t make it out. I don’t know it really freaked me out and I considered waking up my roommate and telling her about it but I didn’t want to freak her out so I kept it to myself but after that I just felt very weird and I just knew I was gonna get SP or something tonight. I’m a pretty spiritual person and although i’m used to getting sleep paralysis this just felt weird, i’ve never had as much movement available to me during an episode as i did tonight.. i was able to  bang my fists on the wall behind me even tho it felt like in a dream where it felt slower and weaker but regardless i was doing it but i couldn’t move enough to get out of bed?? and i’ve never experienced vision problems like this..losing it only at certain times basically only unable to see what I was trying to look at but still seeing the room around it. Idk just wanted to share the experience because now i can’t sleep and i’m still trying to work through it. I’m a pretty spiritual person so if anyone has any advice or theories about the experience or just want to share something similar please do."
706,"Nightmare, dehydration?",Sleepparalysis,2,"Last night was very hot and humid. I had a single sheet on the bed. It took ages to fall asleep and when i did, i had the worst nightmare/paralysis ive had for a while. There was something literally dragging me off my bed. I could feel myself holding onto the pillow and sheets, and the figure doing this to me was stood at the bottom of the bed pulling me by my ankles. In my dream, i tried to wake up but was unable to, i tried several times and felt at one point like i was stuck, and wasnt going to wake up.

This has literally terrified me. Im scared of going to sleep tonight. One thing i have noticed, is if i dont drink enough water before bed, these tend to happen more often than not. Obviously the flipside, is that you may have to get up and pee 😂 but id take that, over being dragged out of my bed by an unknown sleep entity anyday of the week."
707,"Weird SP, anyone experienced this?",Sleepparalysis,1,"Hi everyone, it’s currently 12:30 am and had a couple of (what I believe is) sleep paralysis. It happens when I’m falling asleep. Never when waking up. Anyone else have this? Also what’s weird is I can move. I’ve like scratched/hit my face to try to wake up (unless I’m dreaming this?) but never manage to wake up from this. Also something else that’s creepy that doesn’t happen as often- i feel like I float up in the air or that I’m going to roll off my bed - like I’m getting pushed. Ive woken up with a foot on the floor when I’m about to actually fall down. Just weird stuff. Anyone else experience similar things?"
708,Sexual Sleep Paralysis,Sleepparalysis,8,"So just curious if others experience this form of sleep paralysis ?
I don’t experience sleep paralysis too often but when I do it’s always the same . At first the early memories of my sleep paralysis were much more scary as most of the time it felt like I was either being “kidnapped” , as in the feeling of being carried  , or a feeling of being raped almost .I feel like as I started getting more used to identifying that I was in sleep paralysis it changed , so now it’s always a very sexual experience . Horrible to say but it’s like pleasurable now ? Its like I can feel all the sensation and weight on my body of these sexual experiences . But this last time was particularly interesting because , I realized I was in sleep paralysis and started controlling the sexual “acts” if you will that were happening to me . 

It’s really bizarre ."
709,Is it bad to have chronic sleep paralysis (maybe once every two weeks or so),Sleepparalysis,9,"I have been having almost bi-weekly bouts of sleep paralysis since maybe around 2016. It has gotten to the point now that I don't even get stressed or scared when it happens, but it always annoys me to no end.

I used to do the finger wiggle trick and stuff to wake myself up, but now when I try to do it my brain seems to just ""dream"" that I wiggled my fingers and toes, so I don't actually wiggle them, so it takes me much longer to actually wake myself up. I tried forcing myself to hyperventilate to trick myself into waking up as well, but that started giving me anxiety when it took too long to wake me up so I don't do that anymore.

Is it unhealthy for me long term? I'm worried I might have some sort of disorder. I am skeptical about seeing a specialist since it happens to me on an unpredictable schedule, so when they do the sleep testing on me I might not even get sleep paralysis. Especially if I'm sleeping in an unfamiliar environment, my brain might just not decide to go into sleep paralysis mode. If there any any real long term health effects, then I don't mind dealing with the annoyance, especially if I have to pay a lot of medical bills just to figure out whats going on."
710,Was this sleep paralysis or did I dream about sleep paralysis ?,Sleepparalysis,4,"I've had sleep paralysis once before this one. In the first one I had, towards the end of it, someone with a blue sweater came up behind me in my bed and held me and kept telling me ""just hang on tight!"" He repeated it over and over until I woke up. It was more comforting than demonic, which is weird lol. But last night, a very dark figure came through my door and held me down and I screamed, but nothing came out. The dark figure disappeared and I heard/felt someone climbing into my bed behind me again. I was so scared to turn around to see what I was about to face. But I did, and it turned out to be an old co-worker of mine. It was completely random and we ended up just chatting and the dream continued into something else. Was this sleep paralysis ? Or did I just dream about sleep paralysis ? Does sleep paralysis happen then turn into a regular dream without waking up first ?"
711,Has anyone else experienced this? / Does anybody know what this is?,Sleepparalysis,2,"I’ve had sleep paralysis every now and then since I was a kid, but recently i’ve been having the same type of “Sleep Paralysis” every night. The experience itself only lasts 10 - 20 seconds and isn’t nearly as scary as normal SP, and at some point it was starting to be annoying rather than scary. So i’m strictly here to find out if this is SP or not. I’ll describe the experience here: I can barely twitch my fingers, and if I try to scream, the most I can get out of my mouth is a quiet “ah”. My vision is blurry and there is hallucinations, but the most consistent thing through all of the experiences, is that there is always some loud noise that I hear, almost like someone blowing into a microphone. I’ve tried to look this up but i’m getting nowhere. If anyone has experienced the same thing and knows what this is, i’d really appreciate if you helped me out."
712,Does anyone know what this is?,Sleepparalysis,1,"Okay, so, this hasn't happened in a couple of years until now, but I got it this morning;

Sometimes, I get something that feels like sleep paralysis, except I can feel myself move. I can perceive the things around me, and my eyes/visual perception, at least, are unable to move, but the rest of my body isn't stuck or weighed down. I can even feel my head move freely, but everything I see is as if I were in sleep paralysis, not moving.

I've experienced this more often than traditional SP, and I wanted to see if anyone's heard of this. I'm not sure how related this is to SP- maybe it has more to do with astral projection?- but if anyone has any insight, I'd greatly appreciate it!"
713,Does anyone else fly through space during sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,2,"Last night I woke up asleep I heard the buzz again and I was like ""ah here we go again"". I don't really get scared anymore so im just laying there waiting for it to be over. Then I shot out of my body and was zipping through space with out a body I could see the Milky Way galaxy, stars and planets were whizzing past means from a distance I saw a wall of yellow structures and I flew right in to it. These structures were all around me flying by. I couldn't make out what they were but I made it to the end then I flew in to another wall that seemed to be a different dimension I couldn't tell what I was looking at. everything looked like green line art on black. I flew out of that and in to another thing I don't know if they are dimensions universes or what but I was trying to focus on objects but I only saw pixels. Maybe it was too much for my human mind to perceive. Before I knew it I was in a vehicle with three other beings. Like aliens or something. I had a body this time so I put my hand on this things humanoid shoulder to see if I could and it just turned its head and looked at me and finally I flew really really fast in to a light and finally woke up. This has happened to me a few times before sometimes im just flying through a tunnel or floating around in my room. Sorry this is so long but I just wanted to know if anyone has experience this before."
714,Does melatonin make anybody’s sleep paralysis worse?,Sleepparalysis,2,"I experience sleep paralysis pretty regularly anyway, but I took melatonin the past two nights and both nights I experienced it more intensely and multiple times each night. I also woke up grinding my teeth the second night, and I had some weird dreams. Has anybody else experienced anything like this after taking melatonin?"
715,Do you guys also have extremely realistic dreams amidst sp?,Sleepparalysis,4,"What I mean is do you also drift in and out of full-on dreaming while experiencing sleep paralysis?

For example, I once saw a bat flying around my room while experiencing sleep paralysis. For quite some time I tried to move but couldn't. Then suddenly I could and I grapped the bat. Then I lay back down in my bed with the bat still in my closed hand. When in my bed I automatically returned to the same position as I was lying in before and I was stuck again but now with a bat in my hand. After stressing about the bat for a while I realized it was a dream, yet I was still in sleep paralysis for a bit.

Another example is that once I was trying to break out of sleep paralysis and I succeeded! I immediately walked out of my bedroom and into the living room feeling relieved. When I entered the living room I noticed a leather couch. I realised we don't have a leather couch and at once I was back in my bed in the same position I had been stuck in before. It was like when you reset a level in a videogame and go back to your last save."
716,That “sitting” feeling...,Sleepparalysis,7,"I’ve had zero SP incidents for a while (I’ve experienced them since early teens), then four last night. I had woken up around one and noticed Ring alerts on my phone and realized that my husband had left around 9 pm, around the time I went to bed. I don’t know if him going out just triggered some stress or fear, but as soon as I dozed back off, it all started.

First one, I was drifting back to sleep and it felt like someone sat down on the edge of the bed, right against by back. I felt the mattress move and felt a little pressure against my back and I thought it must have been the husband. Then I realized I couldn’t move or react at all and I started trying to wake myself up by attempting to move my arms/hands and making noise. Finally snapped out of it.

It took me a while, but I started dozing off again and I felt the bed shake a little, the way it does when my dog is scratching himself. I woke up out of that easily, so I don’t know if that qualifies.

The third was a dream I can’t remember was upsetting, so I started trying to wake myself up. Finally got my eyes open a little and saw the bedroom wall but everything looked glitchy and kind of staticy and pixelated. Struggled again to move and wake myself up.

The third one I don’t remember, but I know I was trying desperately to move my arms and make sounds. 

What IS that sitting feeling? Not the classic sensation of something on your chest, but literally feeling the bed move. That scares me more than anything because I FEEL IT. Through all of these I just by default had that feeling of a presence that I think just comes with the helplessness and fear, but how do we physically feel things that aren’t there? Is there truly nothing there? 

My husband is going out of town for the next two nights and I’m honestly nervous about sleeping alone. I’ve been slightly off all day and I just don’t want it to spill over into tonight. Any exercises or tips on how to get past those horrible feelings from last night?"
717,My Friend called this a 'Waking Nightmare',Sleepparalysis,5,"Almost 2 years ago on the 17/9/2018 i had experienced something that i find hard to explain even now. I wrote what happened down shortly after i woke up that night in as much detail as i could and now id like to share this experience.

&#x200B;

I had this 'dream' and i could physically see this silhouette of what looked alot like me, i had full control of myself and could move as freely as i wanted to but when i took the opportunity to try and forcefully touch the silhouette some kind of force wasn't letting me have any kind of interaction with 'myself' (the silhouette), But when i tried a calmer and more soft approach i was able to interact with this silhouette.

A short second later and i could feel something alot like my subconscious telling me to tackle this silhouette and the moment i committed and decided to tackle the silhouette everything changed back to normal and i could see my room again. Assuming that i had woken up i wrapped myself up in my duvet and closed my eyes or so i thought because now they where open and all i could see in front of me was this big hedge with a concrete path in front of it, And yet i could still see that i was in my room but not in my bed.

I turned around and again everything flips im suddenly laid down on this concrete pathway and i can see the silhouette sinking into the ground right in front of me and as the silhouette is sinking i decide to try and physically harm (kick/punch) it and just as before i cannot do anything harmful or forced to this silhouette.

About a second or two later and this thing comes back out of the floor but not as the silhouette that i saw it as before, it looked exactly like me but it had the textural appearance of a gargoyle and again just as before i start to try to physically harm this thing in front of me but now im able to and im yelling/screaming at this thing whilst im attacking it.

But again like another switch i go from attacking to now trying to help this thing out of the ground and whilst im pulling \*bam\* im back to reality, I wake up in bed screaming in agony because i can just feel this incredible pain in my leg that felt like it was going to snap/break,the pain then disappears and for a good couple seconds my heart and neck is hurting and i have a massive shortness of breath aswell as a cold presence on me.

After that as you could imagine i started crying and was utterly terrified to even think of going back to sleep.

(i split this up so it wasn't a cluttered mess to read, if anyone knows if this really was a Waking Nightmare please let me know, also I've not experienced anything like this since it happened but its still so vivid and  in my mind and im trying to figure out the reasoning behind as to why i had this experience)"
718,The entity,Sleepparalysis,12,"I'm curious to hear about your guys experiences if you have ever seen an entity or 'sleep paralysis demon'. I have seen one once and am interested in comparing the similarities between mine and others. Before having this experience I would also like to note I had never seen or heard anything about the phenomenon, it just came out of the blue. Mine laid next to me on my bed, limp like a ragdoll. It was light flesh color, had small black beady eyes, long oval alien like face, thin hair, and a huge teeth grin that took up most its face. It just laid there staring at me motionless while I laid there unable to move. I'm very interested if anyone has seen something similar or what they have seen."

720,Is it time for me to seek a sleep specialist?,Sleepparalysis,4,"I've posted and commented quite a bit in this sub; this will not be another ""is the SP' post. 

Since posting in here my episodes subsided- however, in the last month I've had probably the worst string of nights since I developed SP. Not only have my episodes been more frequent, they are accompanied by exhausting lucid dreams and now hypnogogic hallucinations. 

I've become deflated during the days after these nights. I can feel the physiological stress and have started to fear falling asleep. I'm wondering if it's time I seek a medical professional (found a psychiatrist who specializes in sleep medicine in my network), as I do not know what else to do. 

It is really shocking that most of what you find on our \*dissorder\*? is purely research. Wondering anyone and everyone's thoughts.

Thank you."

[Tips To Wake Up From Sleep Paralysis](https://imgur.com/ttiulSz)"
722,my first experience with sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,4,"I’ve been on reddit for quite sometime just to read cool stories and such. I’m really into all the lucid dreaming and all the scary stories and AP... I’m only 14 and I find it all interesting and I’ve always wanted to try and lucid dream and astral project but haven’t made any progress lmao. Just a week ago I had surgery to get my appendix removed and I’ve been taking a lot of pain meds so maybe that could has triggered this? also I haven’t been getting much sleep at all because of how much pain I am in. I barely slept last night so I tried to take a nap just 20 min ago.. right when I fell asleep my eyes opened up and I got this huge sensation of numbness that went all down my arms and legs, i was trying to lift my arms but I couldn’t move anything at all... it only lasted a few seconds and then I woke up. I panicked at first but I knew what it was because I’ve read so much about it! I don’t think anybody will read this but worth a shot lmao and if anyone does it’s normal to have the intense numbing sensation right? 
Anyways it was scary but also cool at the same time.. sorry for the terrible writing and grammar I’m not good at that stuff baha"
723,Sleep paralysis without seeing anything,Sleepparalysis,2,"I've only experienced sleep paralysis once in my life. I was laying on my front side as usual, but when it hit, I was somewhat awake and couldn't move. All I could hear was TV static and I felt like something was in my room. I envisioned it to be like a black, floating mass in my head, but I couldn't see it for sure. I broke out of it after a while and woke up at my dad's door (I was like 13 at the time). It was a surreal, creepy experience.

I'm not too knowledgeable about sleep paralysis, but I wanted to know if this is a common occurrence or if anyone went through anything similar to me."
724,Flashing lights during sleep paralysis or retinal issues?,Sleepparalysis,1,"I have a history of retinal tears. Yesterday I went for a follow up with my retinal doctor who found no issues. This morning I experienced sleep paralysis (haven't had it in 2 months). It lasted for 20 seconds, I was frozen and the left side of my head was slightly pounding and I saw about 20 flashing lights. The night before I only had 4hrs of sleep and have been on high stress levels.

I'm worried about retinal issues however it seems to be one too many flashes to be related plus I saw the eye doctor yesterday. Anyone else experience the same thing with sleep paralysis?"

726,Controlling sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,2,"Ive had my first SP a year and a half ago
Since my first time I started trying to control it

I go to bed , close my eyes and relax while trying to stay awake.

Ive become quite good at entering sleep paralysis state but its never a good experience as soon as I fall I try to wake up , I panic I try not to but I cant help myself

This morning i woke up early , made myself a cofee , drank it , then i went back to bed to my BF (weird right cofee doesnt hold me from sleeping)

So i was holding my boyfriend’s harm
And I felt i could enter SP at that point I can decide whether or not I fall in SP so I started playing with it , coming close to fall then backing up , as long as I dont fall I dont panic but I have mild hallucination , sound , noise , images and feelings.

This morning it was what my father would feel like if i died , Its hard to explain but , to closest i came to fall the greater the pain was , like if I was feeling what he would feel.

I was playing at the frontier of SP until I tried to get a little bit closer , then i fell , suddently I coulnt get out anymore , I was stuck , those feeling , hallucination became so much stronger , I thought I was crying , then my boyfriend turned on his side and That got me out of it.

Im getting better at entering SP if i could just not panic everytime I wonder how that would feel if instead of beeing a so bad feeling maybe thatd feel good somehow.

Ill keep trying one thing I know is that im better at it then I was."
727,"Anyone else feel themselves move, feel getting pushed back down, start to fight it and get stuck in an endless loop?",Sleepparalysis,1,"I feel like I've been able to move more since it started, like I can fully bring myself up to my arms, usually only to get pushed back down. Today I'm really freaked out since in my last experience I felt as though I fully left my bed, got to the other side of my room, and got forced back again. I can't see very well during this either, when I open them it's in blinks since they're forced shut, but I can hear my tv on in the background perfectly. I can't scream either. Luckily I don't visually hallucinate, although I think my movements are hallucinations. It's been happening for around 5 years now."
728,"Does anyone ""feel"" someone grabbing you or pushing you down when going through SP?",Sleepparalysis,16,"I wrote a whole horror short story based on an experience I had last night where I could actually feel someones hand on my shoulder pushing me down against the bed when I tried to get up. I'm pretty sure I was dreaming in retrospect but the dream was extremely realistic with me still being in bed and in the very same bedroom i sleep in. I know, even vivid dreams can be made realistic with memories, but it still startles me."
729,Hear me out I got a proposal,Sleepparalysis,2,"Okay so hear me out for a sec bros, how about just before bed you apply one of those sleeping eye masks, or masturbate before bed, add a small led light to the side of ceiling and lastly sleep to your side but facing the wall/bed against a corner too. Anyone done any of these?"
730,The most strangest occurrence,Sleepparalysis,0,"Basically, i felt something on me while the left side of my neck was hurting badly. I assumed it was something giving me a hickey. 

Here's where it gets weirder: I was still sleepy so I didn't bother to check if any marks actually showed up. So instead I must've dreamt or thought of the marks on me because in my next dream, they showed up! 

I hate SP and need to stop sleeping on my back when I'm exhausted. lol"
731,Are these known to appear in sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,4,"I had what I think is sleep paralysis some times.l
Mostly it's just me being unable to move and being scared and for the sake of everything kerping my eyes closed. 😅

But one time I opened my eyes, no reason to do so, and at the foot end of my bed there were Standing three things.
They looked humanoid but with grins that were far to wide and showed pointy teeth. I remember thinking that the bumps in their hair must be horns. 
They seemed to somehow be connected at about the hips. I don't remember their hair color, only they had different ones. 
Then suddenly they swooped over me and I heard them say ""Don't do that again!"" and giggeling. Then they were gone and shortly after I could move. 

I never opened my eyes in sleep paralysis again. I don't think they were even that scary I just don't want to see something really scary."
732,SP after death of a loved one.,Sleepparalysis,6,"I’m going to be blunt. I found my mother dead last week.....in a very traumatic way. I have regular SP and I am terrified to go to sleep right now. I haven’t really slept since Monday. Exactly a week. I was just starting to use my SP to reach Lucid Dreams. For once I wasn’t scared. But now..... Will she be the figure I see. Will I always see her as the way I found her?  I don’t know. But now I’m going through sleep deprivation, which is a huge trigger for my SP.... if I let myself fall asleep. I saw a therapist who wants me to go on medication to make me sleep. My appt is in a couple hours. I need the medication. She assured me I won’t have dreams on it. But I’m scared. Has anyone else gone through this???"
733,Anyone have any tips on how to stop sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,15,"About every other night I get paralyzed but I don’t feel any pressure or hard breathing and usually it’s someone talking to me full conversation I can’t respond. It’s really clear to hear, better than when I’m awake. Then I’m all good and don’t remember a single word.I don’t take any drugs or medicine vitamins, nothing. When this happens scares me enough to have a hard time sleeping and I wake up early for work. Any advise or thoughts"
734,Reasons for SP,Sleepparalysis,4,"So I don’t have much knowledge or background of the causes of sleep paralysis. All I know is I experience it usually because one of the following: I’m on new depression medication and take it too close to bedtime, I’m extremely tired or I’m hungover. Does anyone else get it under one of those circumstances? The first time I experienced it, it was just one episode really. Now when I do, it’s multiple episodes. Every time I try to fall asleep it starts again. I can’t move. I feel like someone might be in my room coming closer to me. I feel pressure on my chest. Sometimes my limbs tingle or shake but I can’t lift them. The worst of it is if it lasts long enough, I start to panic and can’t breathe well. I’d like to hear about anyone else’s experiences. Very few people close to me have experienced this, so I don’t have anyone to talk to who understands."
735,Black Hat Man,Sleepparalysis,17,"Hey, so as a child there was this black hat man from across the room. There's two other people with him..He has no face, does anybody know who or what this Is? Sometimes I see him In dreams or sometimes I see him In Real Life, He kinda just..watches me? It's starting to freak me out; Or sometimes I'm in a black void with nobody around..does anybody know anything about this? Ah, now I feel like someone's watching me.."
736,Sleep paralysis within sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,10,"Anyone fall asleep and know you’re in sleep paralysis but when you think you’ve gotten out of it, your still in god damn sleep paralysis. I “woke myself up” thinking okay yes I’m awake now stay awake so you don’t fall back into it so I went to go turn the light on and when I flipped the switch... the light didn’t freaking turn on and then I instantly was like “crap I’m not awake right now and my body went back to my real body and I eventually woke myself up” 

Does anyone else experience this whole sleep paralysis within sleep paralysis thing? Any tips?"
737,"Anyone else with non-demonic and more ""realistic"" experiences?",Sleepparalysis,20,"Just reading the posts on here are spooking me out but I relate to none of them except for the feelings and emotions. I've only ever experienced one where I felt a huge shadow was a demon, years ago. But even then, I wasn't convinced it was a demon out to get me.

The most recent ones I've been experiencing are just creepy, but no demons or evil entities lurking about. I see people that I know. My parents, friends and almost always involve a sensation that I'm being lifted from my bed accompanied by a high pitched noise.

If you've been high before, you'll know the feeling. Like your body is being lifted or flying. Ie, high lol. 

Idk, just trying to find someone who might be able to relate."
738,Somehow I stopped an episode as it was starting,Sleepparalysis,3,"I found this subreddit last year after a particularly frightening episode of SP that made me too afraid to try going back to sleep. I have been experiencing SP for a little over 3 years now, and it's terrifying every single time. 


Last night I was laying in bed on my side (I'm normally a side-sleeper) and started to hear the grinding noise and feel my body tense up. I recognized this feeling and when going into SP have gotten in the habit of trying to move any muscle I can until I'm finally not paralyzed anymore and I know it's over. 


This time however, the first move I made was a kick that I threw all of my energy into, and actually ended up kicking the wall and scaring myself awake, and suddenly the lights snapped on. I didn't realize I had fallen asleep before turning them off, legitimately thought it was dark in the room for those few seconds. I stayed awake watching tv for about an hour to calm down before feeling comfortable to try sleeping again. I've never been able to really stop it before it happens like that, but holy fuck was I relieved that that kick actually worked."
739,SP and astral projection at the same time???,Sleepparalysis,0,"Ok so I've been dealing with SP for so long now, I can't actually remember when it started, but now almost every time i fall asleep without watching movies/listening to music i go into SP and consciously I'm really okay with it, i know after SP i'm going to fall asleep soon. 
Last night something really weird happened, I felt like something was physically pulling me out of bed slowly and being in SP I knew I couldn't move, but I forced myself to move my hands so I won't fall out of bed, and I felt how my hands moved virtually, astral projection like. 
Anyways I got really frustrated because I was moving virtually but not psysically and all i wanted was to get into a comfortable position and not falling out of my bed, so I did a grounding exercise, i concentrated on feeling my fingertips and I got out of it.

It wasn't scary or threatening because I'm so used to it but it was really weird.

Ever had this happen to you? Does anybody know what actually happened?"
740,First agressive contact during sp,Sleepparalysis,6,"This happened today and was quite unusual. I often use my hands or try to move my fingers to break free from my episodes, this time i napped with my arma crossed and couldnt break free so easily and for the first time i i had ghost hands projecting out of my torso and they went right away wraping around my neck chocking me. My ears often feel a vibration during episodes, Ive heard sounds too, too add to my panic, sounds where of piano notes randomly being hit many times like chaotic simphony and it also sounded like multiple hands playing on the same piano. Sorry for bad english"
741,Does this count as sleep paralyses?,Sleepparalysis,1,"I had dream today, where after a while a black figure appeared in my dream. With a voice calling me on a phone, and threatening me. This all happened very later into the dream. It became a nightmare when the figure started to jumpscare and torture me with fear in my dream. I then woke up, but in reality woke up in a dream room where the figure jumped in front of me and screamed in bloody sirens. I for some reason noticed it was a dream. I then forced myself to wake up again for real, but my body was frozen and i wanted to turn my body but i couldnt. Only after a few seconds i could. I then woke up finally, but with a beating heart and fear. Whilst in the state, i could still hear the figure and see my real room slightly. But in a shade of black and white. I dont know if it counts as sleep paralyses, but i felt as if i couldnt move. It was as if the nightmare didnt want me to leave."
742,2nd experience with sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,0,"The night before last I suffered from the worst of my two cases of sleep paralysis. Or at least I assume this is sleep paralysis.

I was in bed for over an hour, trying to fall asleep. Nothing happened for a long time until my heart started racing. My heart started beating like crazy, and my whole body felt like it was being crushed and started shaking rapidly. My eyes felt like they were being squeezed and my arms were heavy. I felt absolutely terrified. A primal fear, compared to an artificial one. The feeling passed after about 2 minutes, but it felt a lot longer. I was facing the wall next to my bed so I didn't see any apparitions, but it was just as horrifying compared to when I have seen demons."
743,Can anyone tell me what I saw in my trance?,Sleepparalysis,4,"I had this dream or vision... Not sure if I was just tired, but I did the alchemic meditation that Damien Echols recommends here https://youtu.be/_HOz1y0d0i4 and when I was finished (still a bit conscious) my mind wandered and I saw myself in a very big, white room. You could barely see the tiles but they were still there. There were no decorations on the corners. actually it was completely empty except the middle of the room. In the middle, there was a regular sized square table with a... Person? I'm not sure if you could call it that. Basically was all green and had no specific shape whatsoever. Looked like a rendered human... Kind of like this:

https://images.app.goo.gl/ww1BDaAz3ddPmydw9

There were two chairs, one where he was sitting and other accross the table. Behind him to his right (my left) there was a window were you could see what looked like the night sky with purplish hues and a lot of stars. As I sat down to interact with this person, I remember feeling a bit cautious, even on guard. And as I touched the opposite chair to sit down, his head split in half and the body crumbled, revealing a person with a brownish suit http://imgur.com/a/dVBfSJm like that one but on a more leathery color. Now here is where it gets weird (yep, I know) he had a big spider head (I say spider for lack of imagination to describe it... I would say a middle point between the head of a spider and one of the guys from predator movies). And as I sat down I remember the feeling multiplying, becoming a feeling of dread and just about that moment he started to attack me. He extended from the table and tried to grab me, his mouth opening and revealing huge jaws, trying to take a taste of my face. At that point I felt like I truly fell asleep, but kept seeing in my dream (hope that makes sense). Came to the conclusion that nothing good would come from fighting or being afraid, so I tried  to understand it. What was the reason. Why it was attacking me, how this being actually felt. I know this is going to sound even more weird, but I felt a huge need to understand and befriend this being... As the feeling of dread started to fade, replaced by a feeling of peace, this creature stopped attacking me. Suddenly was sitting in front of me again, hands touching his knees in a formal sitting position. He looked at the window as in innviting me to take a peek. So I stood up and walked towards the window, to take a better look at space or whatever that was. As I started to look outside, a huge flash of light blinded me and suddenly I was back again, feeling really refreshed but tired. Didn't pay it any second thoughts and then fell asleep like a baby.


This was around 2 weeks ago and I've been trying to give it sense since, but to no avail. Sometimes my mind wanders and I'm back in that room, but I either see the human shape or the spider shape just... Sitting there, idle.  Was that a spirit, just my imagination, a demon? I looked at the goetia list and nothing comes close to what I saw, except Buer but looking at the depictions they are still quite different. Am I lossing my mind? Did I see something? Was that just my imagination? The point of why I did that post is to ask you guys How do you guys interpret that because it's been a long time and still can't put my finger on it by myself so now I'm trying to get help from you guys more advanced knowledge."
744,Has anyone ever felt an entity actually within them and/or heard a demonic voice?,Sleepparalysis,31,"I had my 3rd SP experience 2 nights ago that was so terrifying I am still reeling. The first two that were both years ago and years apart, were just my mind waking up and my body not for what seemed like a minute - it felt like there was a presence in the room, but nothing like what happened to me 2 nights ago...

Our cat passed away Thursday morning and I was pretty sleep deprived from him declining in health all week. I ended up going to sleep on my sofa because I couldn’t get his passing out of my head and was tossing and turning in my bed. I finally fell asleep around 4:30am and woke up close to 5 (I checked the time after this incident).... this SP experience was like I was half in half out of awareness, as I could see my coffee table right in front if me (I was sleeping on my side) but there was a Newton’s cradle on it (this does not exist on my coffee table in real life). The metals balls on it started swinging wildly like something was causing them to move and it’s then that I realized a very dark energy was there and the balls sped up even more while this awful high pitch electric sound was buzzing very loudly in my ears. I couldn’t move, couldn’t scream, couldn’t fully wake up, and then felt this demon like thing inside of me, like it was trying to take my soul 😫 I heard a voice struggle to say “Get out of my body!” but the voice was warbled and demonic. It wasn’t my voice. I was trying to scream for my husband upstairs when my voice was finally able to cause a muffled sound which got me out of it. I sensed a presence around me still and abruptly went back to bedroom, in tears. I did not sleep again that night.

What in the actual fuck. Has anyone ever felt an entity actually within them and/or heard a demonic voice like this?"
745,Prevention of sleep paralysis and bad dreams,Sleepparalysis,6,"hey everyone - I came across this sub-reddit randomly and thought I would share some advice from Islam regarding sleeping. The prophet Muhammad mentioned that whoever recites the verse of the throne aka ayatul kursi(a particular verse in the Quran) before sleeping will be protected from the devil until morning. 

I can honestly say this has worked for me everytime I've tried it. Give it a try and let me know how you get on, play the below audio which has the original Arabic and English translation before going to sleep while in bed.

https://youtu.be/Xlf70K7yPZ8"
746,Is it weird that I kinda enjoy my sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,14,"So for a while I would experience sleep paralysis several times a week and at least twice a night if they happened. At first I was terrified I would hate the feeling of falling off my bed or feeling like someone was on the other side of me. I remember one time I swear I heard my dad open my door and come in to my room ( my dad was a truck driver and would work odd hours and sometimes come home at around 4am and always check our rooms when he got home) anyways I thought that my dad came in and just laid down in my bed on top of my covers I felt that the sheets were tighter and everything. I couldn’t move but I still wasn’t scared because I was like it’s just dad so I finally convinced my body I was awake and with all my strength I whipped my body to hit my dad because I always fake punch him. But then my arm just landed on my bed not my dad. It was weird and I couldn’t sleep for a while. My other episodes would happen on the couch where I couldn’t move and would hallucinate that I would finally be able to get up and move to my room and it would repeat a bunch until I was finally able to actually get up. I remember crying one time because I was so scared. I experience a lot of different types of episodes where I hear my moms heels in the hallway, knocks on my door, and even random people singing. I don’t hallucinate that much anymore and now I kinda like having sleep paralysis which is probably an unpopular opinion but let me explain. A year and a half ago I was pretty stressed out I had lots of stuff going on with school and work and my grandpa had just died, I was not doing to well. But whenever I would get sleep paralysis my whole body was numb. Everyday I was so tense the whole time just worrying about all the stressors in my life, my head would constantly be throbbing and sometimes I would start hyperventilating just thinking about allllllll the things I had to get done in one day. I loved being numb and having steady breathing and still being awake. I started to just keep hoping that I would get sleep paralysis so that I could feel the sensation of nothingness. Even when I would hear things or see shadowy figures at the end of my bed I didn’t care because at least I wasn’t awake and dealing with the day. I mean really I don’t think I can stress enough how good it feels to me to not feel anything at all when you go through everyday just holding back the tears and maintaining steady breathing. So ever since then whenever I feel my body get heavier and heavier until I can’t move it, I don’t get scared I just let myself relax and enjoy the nothingness."
747,Connection b/w SP & Paranormal?,Sleepparalysis,5,"I know there’s a lot of debate on whether if SP is just hallucinations or if you’re really experiencing something otherworldly. But do you think SP could be induced by something paranormal as a means to contact you?

A few weeks ago a few friends & I rented a cottage out on a lake. They are super nice & they are pretty old, dated back since the 1950’s. On our last day we moved to a different cottage. It was still nice, had a different feel but i didn’t sense anything particularly weird. I was very sleep deprived all day (which that can trigger an episode) so I went to bed early thinking I’d pass right out until I had the scariest SP to date! I’ve never had this happen before, but as I was falling asleep my breathing started to get shallower and shallower, as well as all of my senses & then my breathing completely stopped & i truly believe my heart stopped beating too. I couldn’t move for a few seconds & then slowly everything started slowly working again. I just brushed it off & tried sleeping again, & it happened again! At that point I got up & started having a panic & anxiety attack b/c I wasn’t sure if I should wake my friends up to take me to the hospital bc I thought my heart was just gonna stop beating again & idk what the f* was happening as I’ve never experienced that before. 

After I calmed myself down I turned on the tv & then after a while I told myself I will try to sleep again. So as I’m falling asleep again I notice my breathing getting heavy & I still just continued to try to sleep & all of a sudden my whole body, head to toe, started to shake uncontrollably. Shaking/vibrating ,, & I didn’t really try to move at that point, I kind of just accepted it... & then to my left there is this little guy standing right next to me, all black from head to toe & then he disappears. & then I look up & there’s a tall man, all in black from head to toe. With black jeans on and shiny black combat boots, standing in the corner. He starts walking towards me slowly and I’m trying to move & scream for help bc I thought it was an actual ghost. I thought I was still in ‘reality’.  I didn’t think I was having a SP episode other than not being able to move bc this was very very real. Usually I mentally know if I’m having SP. and then right as he gets next to me, not knowing wtf is gonna happen next, I snap out of it... then a few mins later my brother comes in cuz he heard me making noises lol!!!! The room was really chilly too. No windows open. Could of meant absolutely nothing though. 

That was the most scary experience to date. Wondering if that cottage has some sort of presence. I never have SP anywhere else."
748,Recent Experience,Sleepparalysis,0,"I've had many sleep paralysis experiences throughout my life, they're all different and none are alike. This hasn't happened to me in quite a while, a few months maybe. It started calming down when I started practicing witchcraft, so it became less frequent since then.

About a week ago now, I was having an odd dream, it wasn't a nightmare. So within it, I was talking to people (I don't know) and for some reason I turned my head to the right, looking down at the floor. Up until here, everything was calm, it was just odd. I saw a person with grey skin, long black hair and a black dress laying on the floor on their belly, so I couldnt see their face (yet). So I approached slowly because it was like ¿? they came out of nowhere. My dream had nothing to do with them, it was like they interrumpted. When I got close enough, they turned around and jumped on me, that's when I woke up and saw them floating above me with their hair pretty much creating a curtain around my head.

I couldn't move my body, my head was sideways so all I could really do was move my eyes to look up at them and let me tell you; they weren't pretty. I tried screaming but I had no voice, they were just looking down at me with their strange expression. I started making small, weak noises in hopes of someone in the house to be able to hear me because now they were getting closer to my body and it felt like they were applying pressure to my chest, I couldn't breathe.

Eventually, someone did hear me, walked in and turned on the light, that's when I was ""released"". They were gone. That's how it ended and I couldn't get their off of my mind that day so I drew them as a way to let go."
749,What workes for you?,Sleepparalysis,5,"Hey at the moment i have a lot of time to practice lucid dreaming but when i attempt to do wild i have a problem. Either I just fall asleep or I try to stay concious but when I try to stay concious at some point I think that its not working and i am just wasting my time, then i will get on my side and try to sleep normal. So i am wondering what you guys do and do you have some tips?

PS: Sometimes I get in the hypnotic state where I can hear some random sounds and every now and then I see light in front of my eyes. Also my body tickels sometimes.

And sorry if there is already a question like mine in this subreddit I didn't look all up"

751,My first experience (today),Sleepparalysis,3,"This has never happened to me before, I’m 19 and have recently been through a very rough phase of my life with depression and anxiety (which hasn’t fully gone away).

I just remember in my dream feeling this rising sense of panic until I woke up (or I think I woke up - everything seemed really weird like I didn’t know weather I was asleep or not) and when awake all my muscles where super tense and I tried to scream for help but couldn’t because everything was just stiff/frozen my heart started racing and I tried to close my eyes but when I did I just saw my ceiling again, as if my eyes where completely transparent.

Is sleep paralysis serious? Should I be concerned, does it repeat every night?"
752,i think i forced sleep paralysis,Sleepparalysis,1,"I never, ever, ever had any sort of experience with sleep paralysis until like 7 minutes ago. i woke up normally at 4, still tired, went back to sleep and woke up at 6:57. but i didnt wake up naturally. my dream before i woke up was me, eyes closed, in some sort of overflowing bathtub. i unplugged the drain and was still asleep but i knew i was dreaming, so i forced my eyes open. it was so hard to open my eyes i waited 3 seconds then tried with everything and they finally opened. i went to roll over to check my phone but i couldnt move. there was 2 sounds, the highest pitch scream i ever heard and static. when i tried to roll over i didnt move but i could feel my left side get numb as i tried to roll with everything to the right. i tried talking to myself to see if i could speak but i couldnt let out a sound. the static got super loud then i closed my eyes again and woke up and could move. was this actually sleep paralysis?"
753,This has been on my mind for 4 years.,Sleepparalysis,5,"I don't really know where else to post this, so I'll share here. Almost 5 years ago, my grandmother passed away unexpectedly in the apartment we shared when I was 18, and about 4 weeks after her death, I found out I was pregnant. Needless to say, it was overwhelming to have a baby at 18, and handle my grandmothers funeral and the financial stress. 
About 6 weeks after she passed away, I was about 7-8 weeks pregnant, still living in the apartment my grandmother passed away in, I decided to crash on the couch because I was tired. I'll never forget this night bc I honest to God think I experienced sleep paralysis. I woke up, but I felt like I still fully wasn't awake. I couldn't move my body, and I felt this heaviness on my whole chest and stomach. I felt like I was being suffocated. I saw this figure hunched on top of me and it looked exactly like my grandmother, except part of her face was burnt off, like her skin was melted off and all I could feel was this heaviness. I remember panicking and just trying to wake up and I just couldn't I couldn't move. After what felt like forever, I was able to snap out of it and wake up, but I ended up having to stay with my ex for a good week until I felt safe enough to sleep at my apartment again. About 3 weeks later I suffered a miscarriage in my apartment. It's been over 4 years since I had this experience, and since I miscarried, and it weighs heavy on me from time to time. I still see that image of that figure that sat on my chest from time to time. I still kind of struggle with sleeping. Maybe I'm going a little nuts over thinking about the incident, but it just really hasn't sat right with me."
754,5th episode and counting.,Sleepparalysis,0,"My familiars have been evolving since I was 7. The older I get the more aggressive and violent they get. They never listen to me. 

Once I found myself lying face down into my pillow when I got SP,  felt a great weight on my back as my head sank deeper..tried to call for help but you know the drill: can't move,can't talk. I lay there...talking myself down,trying not to panic.I would have suffocated for sure. I don't know how long it was but it felt like an eternity.

In the latest episode, I woke up to a noise. The room was dark, the noise became louder. Scanned the room, nothing.I was staring at the ceiling when I heard another noise at my door, I turned my eyes to look. Out of the dark crawls a pale looking thing with glowing yellowish red eyes. It leaps on to me and plants its mouth on my chest. In an attempt to rip out my heart I assume. I could feel it pushing down my shoulders,its mouth and warm breath. I tried to pray, however, owing to my little faith that didn't help sh*t. New plan:direct confrontation. Looked it right in the eye and it stopped immediately. It disappeared just as fast as it appeared, the room began to brighten,the sun was still out and shining brightly at that. I rolled out of bed scared and thrilled at the same time.

I try not to sleep on my back but I turn alot in bed and end up landing on it anyway."
755,Someone please help me figure out my condition,Sleepparalysis,1,"I really dont know what's wrong with me but as of this year every other time I try to nap throughout the day I go into like a binge of sleep paralysis overload every single time I doze off, to the point where I just force myself to stay and wait to get tired at night. Could someone relate or just help me out because I hope it's not a serious condition"
756,i just had it happen for the first time in months,Sleepparalysis,0,"i used to get visits from my sleep paralysis demon a lot but i started doing healthier things like going to be early and at the same time and working out a bit. and they stopped for a long time i thought they would just go away but tonight i went to bed late and as i was going to sleep my eyes couldn’t close i saw black and then i saw him. just standing there i wanted to cry, yell, and move to get away, but i couldn’t move and i felt suffocated. i remembered seeing this thing a while back saying to love your toes or fingers and i tried and it finally worked and it was gone. i just got up and went into my moms bed(yeah i find comfort from my mom shhh) and just sat there trying to proses what just happened and tried to sleep. i couldn’t obviously and i got my phone and just distracted myself and here i am."
757,My Sleep Paralysis Trigger,Sleepparalysis,2,"Just wanted to make a post about it to see if anyone else has identified their trigger.

For me, it's heat. When the room is too hot I definitely get sleep paralysis more. So I get it more often in the summer. I don't take any sleeping pills and I have a regular sleep schedule with around 7-8 hours a night so it's not from exhaustion. I've gotten it while sleeping on my back or on my side. I've had it occasionally all my life so I had a lot of episodes to figure out the trigger."
758,Sleep paralysis is the gateway,Sleepparalysis,16,If you over come your fear of the demon or whatever it is that your are seeing suffocate you because your lungs are not breathing normally because your sleeping you will then go to the next step which is Astro projection or out of body experience
759,Sleep paralysis episode i had this morning,Sleepparalysis,1,"last night, i got a little drunk, then when i wanted to go to bed, i took a melatonin. every morning i wake up on and off until i feel like getting up, this morning i woke up and i couldn’t move, i’ve had sleep paralysis before so i wasn’t freaking out that much. i was laying on my back facing the closet, the frame of my closet started to wiggle and vibrate, i also have a hoody hanging and i felt like the hoody was telepathically communicating to me Lol. it felt like the hoody was waiting for me to go back to sleep so i tried to wake myself up out of it, started to panic, and whenever i get into sleep paralysis i try to call my mom, i knew my phone was on my bed so i kept trying to say “hey siri, call mom” but i’m sure it only came out as mumbles, then i remember using my left hand to pick up my phone, the phone screen looked incomprehensible. then i blacked out, woke up, and i remembered that my phone was on my right side and not my left... so i hallucinated a ghost phone Lol."
760,Holy hell,Sleepparalysis,5,"Just needed somewhere to vent. I’ve been taking about 100mg Seroquel every night for two weeks even though I’m not prescribed nor do I have a diagnosed mental illness. The stuff helps me sleep, which I’ve been struggling with since I can remember. Although it helps knock me out, I usually wake up 2-4 times during the night and will sleep walk while being somewhat conscious awake. I’ve also been having bizarre dreams that are a a lot more vivid than the norm for me. Last night I had a dream I was with my mom and we were talking in front of a mirror and I started crying then the room went darker and we disappeared. Not sure why but that scared the shit out of me. For a little backstory, my dad has custody and my mom lives 3 hours away, I rarely see her so it’s an emotional subject for me. Fast forward to a few moments before I wake up for the first time in the night (maybe 3am?) I open my eyes and it’s almost completely dark in my room. I feel an insane amount of pressure on my chest, all I felt was terror and darkness. I couldn’t speak and my body felt like I was fully paralyzed and glued flat to my bed. I was frustrated but more than anything, afraid. Like, truly afraid. I don’t remember much from the transition into actually waking up, but it was only moments after the paralysis. No more Seroquel for this girl B)"
761,Why is sleep paralysis horrible? Can melatonin help?,Sleepparalysis,2,"I’ve been experiencing sleep paralysis 2-4 times a month and it just ruins my night. I can’t even go back to the room, I am terrified. 

I was having trouble sleeping and kept tossing and turning every 2-3 min. 

I finally changed positions one last time turning to my right side, when I felt something come into the room.

I even felt it approaching like a dark shadow energy. 

It got close to me and felt like this energy was holding down my left arm. I could not move. 

(At this moment I realized what was happening and tried moving, I tried really hard...) 

Whatever it was got close to me and whispered in my ear. It made like this electric buzzing noise. 

I finally was able to move and nothing was there.

Is there anything I can do to stop this? I hate it so much.. 

I’ve noticed that taking melatonin stops my dreams all together. 

Has melatonin helped anyone else? 

Thank you"
762,Is it normal that SP demons look like regular humans?,Sleepparalysis,4,"Just woke up from my most intense sleep paralysis experience so far. My head still feels very muddy as I'm writing this.

After years of having SP every now and then, I think I finally met my demon. So far he's been nothing but kind to me, never talked, just did things like soothingly patting my head and back or showing me animals for comfort. Sometimes he'd lift my hands, but very gently. 

Nowadays I'm not afraid at all of SP, instead I feel actually excited to see what's going to happen. And just now I was paralysed for about an hour, briefly woke up here and there but got immediately pulled back into paralysis every time. 

My demon was there through the entire experience, taking my hands, cuddling up to me and holding me close. At some point he also said something to me and I apologised, but unfortunately I can't remember what it was . When I tried to look at his face, his eyes briefly flashed red which freaked me out for a moment, but I felt that he wasn't dangerous so I calmed down again. All in all it felt very comforting. 

Is it normal that demons have human form? He was built like a viking, with long darkbrown hair and beard and tattoos all over his body. Very friendly face. I'm unsure what to make of all this, but I'm looking forward to meet him again and maybe ask some questions if I'm able to."
763,"When I have these false awakening dreams, am I sleeping with my eyes open?",Sleepparalysis,12,"I have a lot of looped false awakening dreams where I’m looking at my wall but unable to move.   I try to put my hands out in front of me but they’re invisible (maybe they’re my “dream hands” because my actual body is paralyzed?) 

I’m eventually able to feel my way out of bed and go downstairs (at this point I’m definitely dreaming) and it’s more like a regular false awakening dream, but I keep waking up and I feel like I’m really looking at my wall. When I actually wake up I’m looking at exactly what I saw while I was dreaming, which leads me to believe that I’m having sleep paralysis with my eyes open... I’m not totally certain."
764,Sleep paralysis and trying to figure out what's going.,Sleepparalysis,1,"having sleep paralysis about a month back. I have had horrible nightmares on and off through my life but this is the first time with this experiance. The first time I woke up middle of the night to see a shadow figure standing in the corner with a hat on. There was a lady sitting on the floor next to my bed she didn't look the hag they mention but she was creepy. The man kept getting closer to me and I couldn't move and in my head I called on angels the white light of protection and God and he eventually stopped. The next night I laid there not wanting to sleep but I did fall asleep eventually. Luckily my cat which I knew could feel my anxiety sleep in between and the corner and honeslty I could feel his presence but it wasn't able to get to me. In the meantime I have had sleep paralysis a few times a week seeing the shadow man. Several times I noticed before I went to sleep and its dark in the room my desktop computer would turn on and off ( you have to touch the mouse for it to come on) It would stay on and flicker and one night I yelled, leave me alone and turn off the light!"" Then my computer monitor turned off and didn't come back on. However I did have sleep paralysis that night. This has happened several times and on several occasions my husband would tell me that he would wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and see my computer turning off and on ( also have checked to debunk if something is wrong with my computer and it's fine, it does not do this during the day at all). Last night I had sleep paralysis and it was a women and she was shaking me and her eyes went from brown eyes to solid black and she started laughing hysterically at me. I later found out my husband woke up at 3:33 and he said the computer was turning off and on again. He doesnt really care about paranormal stuff but it was enough to make him say something to me which is even odd. Anyway any insight to what is going on would be helpful 🙏 honestly after seeing the black eyed women I was more freaked out where before I was just dealing with it."
765,my sp night terror,Sleepparalysis,4,"My first and I pray only sleep paralysis experience consisted of a man that looked liked a mannequin but had a shadowy tint to him. My lights began to flicker as he grew abnormally large and got very close to my face. As this was happening I heard 2 static-like tornado sirens going off, and that got louder as he grew closer. It got to a point where me and him were eye to eye, and the sirens became deafening. My heart began to beat out of my chest and I felt like I was being pulled to the bottom of the ocean or like I had a 2 ton wrecking ball dropped on my chest. Not being able to breathe, I tried screaming and crying for my mom, hoping she would hear me and come to my aid and I even tried throwing myself off my bed. Yet... Nothing worked, it was like I was frozen in time and only able to move my eyes. Eventually I heard a loud pop, closed my eyes and snapped into reality. Woke up with tears running down my face, not realizing what had just happened! 

I don’t know if this was the cause of it, but I feel that I should mention I was on a 1 month journey to try and lucid dream. I would listen to binaural beats every night and lay flat on my back to try and enter a lucid dreaming stage, until well... this happened. I still to this day want to lucid dream, but the experienced I had with sp was (no exaggeration) by far my most traumatic experience I have yet to go through, and I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy. 

If you guys have had something similar to this, please let me know I would be really interested to hear it, thank you for reading!!"
766,Questions about my sleep paralysis.,Sleepparalysis,1,"This is gonna be kind of long, so please bare with me... I call it my better sleep paralysis because every time I look it up online I hear about people experiencing shadow figures, or demons, or the feeling of someone sitting on their chests. And while mine freak me out, those sound terrifying. Mine are different though. They happen when I’m falling asleep and it starts when I close my eyes and I have an image in my head that’s frightening. The last time it happened I shut my eyes and saw a truck headed straight for me so I opened my eyes immediately but could not move my body, or my head, and I heard the truck noises getting louder and louder. When it was finally over I couldn’t fall asleep for a couple more hours, fearing it would happen again. It didn’t. Another very rememberable time was when I was asleep on my aunts couch and right across from me is the staircase and the wall. The wall is lined with clocks (my aunt collects them) and I had just fallen asleep when I got another image in my head and thought I was dreaming. I tried to open my eyes and when I finally could I couldn’t move but I could hear every sound coming from those clocks. Like I said, it’s not as scary as other experiences I’ve read about, but it does worry me going to bed at night because of it. I have some questions if anyone can answer them for me, that’d be awesome! 

1. I can’t recall this happening at my house at all. I stay with my aunt quite a bit, and it only happens over there. Does certain rooms trigger it?? 

2. Has anyone else experienced something similar to my experiences?? Not with the shadow figures or demons or anything like that. Just noises and not being able to move?? 

3- Does anyone have any tips on how I can prevent it so I can sleep at night?? Or how to stop it when it’s happening?? 

Thank you!!"
767,A typical night,Sleepparalysis,3,"I spend 3 days awake.. I'm tired... I'm restless... I want to sleep...i drink myself to sleep. I finally sleep. I feel good. Has it ended? Maybe just for the night. That's okay. One night is good. It's a start...
I wake up. everyone is pissed at me...why can't i drink? They don't know what it's like.. I spend the next 2 days awake... I'm tired. I'm restless. I want to sleep...im scared....😔
I finally start falling asleep. am I asleep? I think I'm dreaming? Wait? It feels to real.. I'm not in my bed... I'm confused..it feels so real..but I know i'm not there... I start rolling around.. the room is dark, just light enough to see, I'm with someone. It's a kid, hes screaming, hes laughing. his face is gone, it's scratched out, hes in my room, I'm wide awake now! I'm getting choked. I can't breath, I CAN'T BREATH! I feel trapped! I feel claustrophobic. I scream, I yell, I rolll around, I keep screaming. No one can hear me. No one is coming, I'm not moving. I'm not yelling I'm completely stuck! everything's quiet... I'm still stuck 😔 
I'm finally free! I sit up! My heart is racing!! I'm out of breath. I sit there wide awake. Trying to catch my breath. I calm myself.. Everythings okay? Everythings okay
I finally lay back down....

.... I'm fucking stuck!!! AGAIN!! I cant move!!! Get me the fuck out!! Please god fucking please!!! My eyes are watering. My heart is racing! I'm losing my breath.. something is choking me. Please fucking pleasee I want to fucking move!!! 
I yell! I scream!! Nothing's fucking working...i lay there and wait....

I finally start to move around! I sit up. I get out of bed...i pour myself a drink... Everyone's pissed at me 😔
When will this fucking end 😪"
768,What am I experiencing in my sleep?,Sleepparalysis,3,"I used to have it more ofter in the past - like i have a period that it happened once a week. 

Last night, it happened after 1-2 year for the first time.

I was basically having a dream in which i was still in the same bed, seeing the same setting around me. And in this dream i had other(normal) dream too. And the dream were so bad that i wanted to wake myself up, but when i experienced tingling and high pitch voices in my head like it was going to explode. I managed to fall asleep again and it happend another time over and over.

I remember that in the past, only thing to stop this feeling was waking up and just sitting for 1-2 minutes. Then, when i went to sleep again it didn't happen for the remaining phase.

Anyone knows how is this called and how can i prevent it?"
769,Multiple episodes of SP a ‘night’.,Sleepparalysis,4,"Does anyone else experience multiple episodes of sleep paralysis in a short space of time? When I say multiple I mean between 5-15 times and often in a very short space of time (1-3 hours), one after another. I get the sleep cycles bit, done the research, just wondering!?

I have some mental health issues the main one being Bipolar Disorder. I have recently started taking Lamotrigine (Lamictal) and I take 100mg in the morning and 100mg at night. However this is not the first time I have experienced this type of sleep disturbance. I have had bouts of SP throughout my adult life, including these recurrent episodes, some of the worst when I first started travelling in Asia (I’m from the U.K.). At the time I knew different time zones, sleeping on my back and upheaval of routine was the likely cause of this. This particular time I have been getting it when I sleep on my side which I know is rarer. I’m fully aware that the medication (and my condition) is a likely cause of these particular episodes, but i have still experienced this when not on my meds. 

I’m just generally putting feelers out as it seems hard to find information (or experiences) on these recurrent episodes. Other than the named disorder ‘Recurrent Isolated Sleep Paralysis’, but even then there’s fuck all info about it 🤷🏻‍♂️

TIA everyone 🙏🏻😊"
770,Hallucinations of gigantic spiders,Sleepparalysis,10,"I don’t know if this is considered to be a part of sleep paralysis or not but sometimes when I first wake up and I’m lying in bed, it looks like there are giant spiders crawling on my ceiling/walls. After a few seconds, they disappear. Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this?"
771,"Is sleep paralysis a consistent occurrence, or possibly exhaustion related?",Sleepparalysis,11,"Some background, I am not a Morning person, never have been, but for the last 15 years have been in the constant position of having to get up early (if it’s past 6 I’m having major problems for the rest of the day on almost any given day, 5 is the normal latest I should be up at). I’ve always had. Hard time doing this, if I’m lucky I can get to lay down for bed between 11 to midnight in recent months (better than the prior window of midnight to two am). 
So, recently I’ve been trying to wake up earlier to try to get ahead of things and am trying to set a habit of waking up early enough to start working out again, as I’m getting dramatically out of shape. By my calculations I need to be up by 3:15 am. 
I don’t seem to be able to do this, but I have been able to get up at 4 am a few times a week. Here is where the whatever I’m having has started happening in recent weeks, getting steadily worse as I get more consistent waking up at 4. 

I’ll hear the alarm, but not be able to move to turn it off or get up. Before I used to often straight sleep through alarms, and I still sometimes sleep through my early alarm, but several times in the last week I’ll hear my alarm, and be stuck listening to them. Meanwhile, today being the worst I’ve ever had of this, some of the most insane thoughts I’ve ever had and are flooding me like visions as I try desperately to move or get up over the course of I’d say four hours, couldn’t move like I had zero strength in my body. Hurt to try, but I’ll end up facing consequences from not being up and I could not make it happen. left me very irritated and all morning so far I’m wondering if I can go the day without snapping at some one. I could hear my alarms, and other people in the house getting ready for the day. 

Even after managing to get up I’m not clear headed, definitely extremely irritated (I’m usually irritated and tired after this sort of nightmare like event) 

Also, don’t know if this is a factor but close to a decade ago I was diagnosed with sleep apnea, sever sinus damage and moderate hearing loss (hearing related to military service).

So I’m trying to figure if it could be triggered by not getting enough rest over a long period of time? basically my body rebelling. telling me to fuck off while it tries to get its minimum rest needed to function? This isn’t the first time I’ve had similar experience but recently has been intense and more frequent vs a general sense of being awake and unable to move that I’d have occasionally.

I think there’s more details but I’m sort of groggy and am already very behind and started working now after starting to type this post"
772,Covid-19 Prayer,Sleepparalysis,2,"Someone at work got positive for Covid-19. So I quarantined myself until I had the results(came negative). This caused great stress to my mom. She would call and say god help me please stuff like that.

Two nights ago, I had sleep paralysis. I saw my door unlock and open slowly. I wanted to close my eyes because I hate hallucinations. Came in walking was a big pale old lady that looked like Mozgus from Berserk. I shut my eyes so I won't see her. I started to hear things, I heard my mom. She told Lady Mozgus, ""There he is..."" 

They started to pray for me. I tried to move, but can't because of sleep paralysis. As I struggle to move, Lady Mozgus came closer and whispered to me, ""do not struggle, I am here to help.""

Felt like my body was getting jerked around, but I finally gain full consciousness and woke up.

Wild Sleep Paralysis."
773,Could my hallucinations mean somethings about me?,Sleepparalysis,1,"I have really bad sleep paralysis. (Being mutilated by two entities, sometimes at the same time.) One being a big withered corpse and the other being a static figure with red eyes. Could this mean something?"
774,Do eye masks help with hallucinations?,Sleepparalysis,8,Is it possible to get hallucinations with closed eyes/complete darkness?
775,RSP,Sleepparalysis,6,"     Figured this was a good place to share this. I had my first SP episode when I was around 10 or 12 in my grandparents house. Still live there with my grandmother and ex Marine Uncle. I was laying in bed, and I woke up to a very large shadow figure with a top hat/ bowler hat and white pits for eyes and he was at least 8 feet tall. Now, I wasn’t scared but I knew this wasn’t normal. I slowly being picked up by my fingers towards the end of my bed while he just looked down at me. My mind KNEW I was asleep and I could feel my eyelids shut but I could still see. (Trippy af lol) I felt whatever force it was let go, and I woke up falling back onto my bed. I fell back to sleep moments later. What I find strange about this now is that I know if you’ve succumbed to SP, then fall right back to sleep nine times out of ten you’ll fall right back into it but I didn’t. 

    Fast forward a few years, I’m in HS Freshman year in science class, barely got any sleep typical DGAF attitude until I just slam my head on the heavy ass tables we used involuntarily and fall asleep. Again, I felt the eyelid thing and I couldn’t break free until after five minutes of fighting. Felt like 30 seconds. 

      After this episode, it gradually went down but I did experience “other” things that don’t belong in this SR. I had one where my vision was blurred and I was deafened by the R6S reinforce wall sound. I’ve been to concerts and rage vest and they don’t come anywhere close to how loud that shit was. 

      Worked at Walmart for a year and a half, had typical can’t move or wake up fits with no hallucinations. But when I’m at my fiancé’s house and experience it, her door is always sideways in the doorway, and a shadow man is peering in. And when I say sideways I literally mean that instead of opening in or out, it opens up or down. Imagine if you grabbed the top lip of the door and pulled down and the door pivoted in the middle and you could swing it up and down and spin it. That’s what it was. 

     Have some more that I can’t remember if anyone is interested when I remember them. Hope you guys get some good sleep."
776,I want to know what I have (possible EHS?),Sleepparalysis,2,"Okay so I’ve been frequently having what I think is sleep paralysis for about three or four years now. Nothing too strange, I’d just feel like I’m falling and I’d hear voices in my sleep or even hallucinate up a dead woman in front of me. But today it’s different.

Like usual, my head would fill up with something like static until it felt like my head was going to explode. I acknowledged it in my dreams a couple of times, how I was going to die because it is a scary experience. But today it was like eight times worse than usual. It hurt so much... I woke up and my jaw is in pain and my head hurts to touch. I get that this may be all just in my head, but I’ve had enough. I just want to know what it is. 

If anyone has any ideas then please let me know. Thank you"
777,Was this sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,2,"One time about a year ago I fell asleep with Star Trek the Next Generation on. I had a dream where I was watching myself sleep from the corner of my bedroom, levitated in the air. Next to me laid Data, who was laying in a spooning position (he was big spoon) resting his hand on my back and whispering into my ear. 

The feeling of him being an entity or presence was intense. It was very powerful. I watched but did not feel terrified. I essentially watched what felt like an entity lay in bed with me while I slept and touch my back. I woke up disturbed and felt like something really did touch my back. 

Is this sleep paralysis? I felt so strongly the entity that took on Data’s form was a separate being. Like I met something “other.” Also, I’ve never had another dream where I was watching myself sleep like an observer in the corner."
778,Man screaming in ear,Sleepparalysis,9,"This was a while ago but when I last had sleep paralysis I heard a tap dripping, then a man screaming. it was very weird. Not had anything for years fortunately but it does make me wonder. Has anyone had similar?"
779,"Had a SP in a dream, definitely weird",Sleepparalysis,2,"I don't usually nap, but today I was having a lazy day off and eventually I dozed off around 4pm. I was dreaming and all of a sudden I had a sleep paralysis in the dream: I wasn't awake in my bed as usual, but I was still in the dream and the dream setting didn't change at all.

In the dream, I was at my parents' house, my fiance was working in my father's study and I was chilling on the balcony right outside the study. The dream interpretation is a story for another day, but in the dream I was feeling peaceful, relaxed and fulfilled, definitely a very nice mood. All of a sudden, I felt dizzy and extremely weak, like I was about to pass out drunk. I couldn't keep my eyes open and every tiny movement was a huge effort, I couldn't keep my head up. And then I heard it, the SP noise which I can't properly describe, but I've heard it plenty of times during my SP. It's like the buzzing in your head you hear after a very loud concert or explosion, but more high pitched and very loud, almost *material*, as it has its own texture, if this makes sense.

Usually, after more than 20yrs of sleep paralysis, I'm pretty good in figuring out what is happening and how to drag myself out of it and wake up reasonably quick, I haven't had an allucination in years. But in the dream I had no clue and I thought I was about to die, so I tried to crawl towards the door and reach my fiance, and it was definitely the same feeling I have had during every SP. I tried to move but I couldn't, I was conscious of the physical effort I was doing despite my body ignoring the commands, the usual stuff. But in the dream I really thought that I was going to die and I panicked pretty bad. After a few minutes I got a text and the phone buzzing woke me up immediately.

Now that I'm conscious, I think that it definitely felt like a SP except for the fact that I was in a dream and the dream remained intact, same setting, same environment, nothing changed around me at all. I don't know if the fact that I was sleeping near a window wide open had something to do with dreaming of being on the balcony, but still, I wasn't awake at all during the paralysis.

Any thoughts or similar experiences?

780,Being Choked.,Sleepparalysis,5,"I don’t even know how to start this. I’ve had sleep paralysis for years maybe due to depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses common in my family. However a couple of hours ago I had probably one of my worst experiences. This all happened hours from each other... I had opened my eyes because of feeling of dread started washing over me, I wanted to move but I was paralyzed and I could feel a presence next to me which I figured was my mom since she sleeps next to me when she gets panic attacks so the feeling of dread quickly washed away feeling safe that she was there next to me. I went back to sleep as if nothing happened since I’m kinda used to it but after an hour or two I feel the presence that was next to me get on top of me. I felt two hands grab my throat and start to strangle me, my body was frozen and my eyes were fixated at the pitch black ceiling. I was petrified as I could not breathe and I could swear it was someone choking me for I could feel the warmth of human hands on my neck and somebody talking under their breath. Once I could move my arms I tried to pull away the hands from my throat but their weren’t any and the feeling subsided. I turned on the light expecting to see someone hiding but the room was empty. I went over to my mothers room to make sure she was okay and that nobody was in the house. She woke up when I entered the room and immediately asked me if I was okay. I asked her if she was in my room at any point of the night and she said no. I haven’t been able to sleep since, I feel so tired but I’m scared it might happen again. Have any of you felt as if someone was choking you? Should I drink more melatonin to help me sleep?"
781,I'm 16 (m) and I have just started to have SP. I need advice on what to do. I'm afraid to sleep.,Sleepparalysis,14,"I've only experienced it 3 times so far. The first time was when I was waking up and I had no clue what was going on. I didn't see any scary figures or anything but I felt a horrible weight on me and I felt like I was going to suffocate and I couldn't scream.  The second time I woke up from a nightmare with it and same thing happened.  I cant move at all and I cant scream or talk no matter how hard I try.  The third was in the same day.  I laid down for a nap a couple hours after it happened the first time because I woke from the nightmare really early in the day.  Which was today. I havnt seen any scary figures or anything but since its only happened 3 times I dont know if they will appear or not.  My father is one of those pentecostal ""everything is the devil"" people and he just told me its all psychological and it isn't real and I just need to watch what I listen too and watch.  I really need advice because I am terrified and my dad does as he does, minimalize everything. How do I get him to take this seriously? How do I deal with the fear of going to sleep? Will the SP stop occurring or am I past the point where it will keep happening? Will the scary figures and hallucinations start appearing? Is there any connection to sleep paralysis and what you watch on TV? Please help.
Edit: it just happened again.  I was sleeping on my side against a wall and it still happened.  I'm scared"
782,First time having sleep paralysis but my story doesnt seem to match others I read about.,Sleepparalysis,4,"So I had a weird series of events happen to me not long ago. First I had a weird dream that ended in me being grabbed by something and then next thing I know is that I was awake in my bed with a man speaking loud into my ear but I could not see him, also I could not understand him. Then it felt as if there was a bass speaker in my head drowning out all other sound. I also felt completely numb but yet I could hear my brother playing games in the next room and when I went to yell or make any noise all I did was breathe out. I became frantic but yet I realized I could move my left arm and from this I became aware of everything and I thought I was awake and I can't remember but I thought I flipped myself over the side of my bed and hit the ground. I then woke up for real after that laying in the position I was originally in. Can someone please explain why I could move during the paralysis, was it from my brother playing too loud or just because I became aware. Or even that this was not sleep paralysis but some screwed up nightmare. Btw I should note that these events lasted 20 minutes from when I went to sleep.

Edit: I forgot to include that during what I could see besides my ceiling, is that it was like a vignette filter was around my eyes also that I also did experience seeing something like a shadow with its hands wrapped under my jaw and looking over me but it wasnt clear enough to make that assumption. Now that I type that out I guess a good visualization would be those baby things from transit on Black Ops 2 zombies after you roam away from the bus."
783,Static Shadow People,Sleepparalysis,3,"Posting this to see if anyone has ever had a similar experience. I’ve heard of these shadow people many times, but had never experienced them until this instance, in my experience they weren’t necessarily “shadows”.

As the sleep paralysis ensued, I was in perfect alignment to be looking at the door to my room (which was closed) it opened, a tall masculine figure was standing there, he had a bowlers cap on or some kind of fedora maybe? It was a 3 dimensional silhouette. 

The thing is he wasn’t shadowy at all, his body looked like TV static. After he opened the door he slowly began walking towards me, I could hear what sounded like thousands of whispering voices emanating from his body, louder and louder as he got closer. He then stood above me looking down at me, a no more than a foot away. The whispering became deafening, I snapped out of it.

This is a true story, I’m curious if anyone else has experienced something similar to this as it was my first time encountering some type of “being” while sleep paralysis occurred. Thoughts will be appreciated, thanks for reading."
784,What caused my paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,0,"I experienced paralysis when I listened to this one night...maybe this is the cause? Give it a try and see if it happens to you too.

[https://youtu.be/CJpzFlvLvgI](https://youtu.be/CJpzFlvLvgI)"
785,Sleep paralysis as an 7-8 year old,Sleepparalysis,2,"When I was really young, around 7 or 8, I experienced a lot of sleep paralysis, every single night, to the point where I would intentionally keep myself awake. My parents trying to get me to bed was a nightmare, I eventually would sleep with them but it didnt help at all, the demons still came. 

I would see things coming out of my closet, the door would open and the demons would come to my bed and float above me, parallel and move me around, raking their claws up and down my back. Sometimes they would whisper to me things I couldnt understand but the claws were the worst.

Finally and abruptly it ended after 2 months but even to this day it still happens. I have learned how to try and wake up or get myself out of that state so it seems manageable, but Those hallucinations still haunt me to this day. When I was that age I also experienced a lot of seemingly paranormal things in the house I grew up in. I would see figures and see things moving around when there should be nothing there. 

I guess my question is that does anyone believe that these sleep demons are real paranormal events or possibly connected? I'm sorry if this is a common question but I have never really discussed this with anyone. I know there is a logical explanation for the hallucinations but I cant shake the weird presence in that townhouse I grew up in. Whenever I bring it up to people, I am dismissed and laughed at, which is kind of annoying since this traumatized me as a child."
786,Does my experience sound like sleep paralysis?,Sleepparalysis,3,"This is the second this this has happened now:

I was napping on my back (I usually sleep on my side). Suddenly I couldn’t move in my dream, then I realized that I’m dreaming, and then as I started to wake up I could barely move. When I say barely, I mean I was only able to move my fingers at first and then after about 5-10 seconds of realizing I was awake I was able to roll onto my side.

No auditory or visual hallucinations; I did experience tinnitus which I commonly get when I’m anxious.

Never had an experience like this at night or during a 2+ hour sleep.

Anyone have similar experiences? Does it sound like sleep paralysis? Sleep paralysis is pretty much my worst fear so I fear it starts like this. Any advice appreciated."
787,"Anyone else experienced a ""vibrating"" sensation in their head?",Sleepparalysis,39,"I've recently been having some strange sleep paralysis episodes.

Usually I wake up and cannot move and just feel what I can only describe as a scary feeling and my partner says I kind of make the noise of a zombie lol, I snap out of it after she gives me a shake and go back to sleep fine. But the past few nights I've been waking up unable to move and feeling this extreme vibrating sensation in my head along with the scary atmosphere. It's hard to describe but if you can imagine a machine turning or an engine or something like that and resting your head against it, it's very intense but the other strange thing is I felt as though I was half conscious of this vibrating feeling and could almost come in and out of it consciously. As this is happening my partner was shaking me each time ""I went in"" and getting me out of it but as soon as I let myself I got the feeling again. 

Sleep paralysis crossed with a lucid dream? Was just unusual for me so I thought I would share, maybe someone's had a similar experience or this is a heads up before it happens to you :)"
788,Question.,Sleepparalysis,3,I’ve heard that attempting to lucid dream may lead to sleep paralysis. Is this true for anyone on here? Just wanting to know before I try.
789,How to destroy SP Demons,Sleepparalysis,3,"Well, as a novice of experiencing SP, I picked up other info, to be able to make this post. There is a small amount of ways, and I know only five. I will now begin.  


First Way - If the demon is getting closer to you, start screaming. The demon should just disappear.  


Second Way - Keep on saying in yourself ""You are not real, you are a part of my inner imagination"".  


Third Way - Since demons are parts of your imagination, imagine a way to kill him without moving (whispering, etc.).  


Fourth Way - There were rumors that if you're laying on your shoulder, no demons would appear, but I  believe that's truth. I had sleep paralysis when I slept on my shoulder, and there was no demons.  


Fifth Way -  If you are sleeping with somebody (your partner or other) demons should never appear."
790,Sleep paralysis inside a dream inside a dream?,Sleepparalysis,3,"This happened 10 minutes ago. I woke up today at 6am. That has nothing to do with this, but I went back to sleep at 8am probably. I had a lucid dream. One of my first ones actually. It was probably my longest one. Only about 30-50 seconds. Then I think I woke up. Not sure that I actually woke up. I'll get to that in a second. When I ""woke up"" I was watching Netflix again, (I watched Netflix before I went back to sleep) I was very tired again but I went to watch a series I didn't know. It looked like an '80s show. There were 2 characters. That's all I remember. Then I fell asleep. I was in a bed. I couldn't move. Oh shit. You see where this is going. I was well aware of what sleep paralysis is so I didn't panic too much. I can't say it was that scary. I saw a woman with a white suit on. She was in front of me. I could see her legs. And I saw some bloody red smiling faces around me. I slowly looked up, and I saw her neck. I was terrified so I just closed my eyes and wiggled my fingers, I didn't want to get traumatized by her face. It was thankfully over quickly. That was my first sleep paralysis ever. Now I ""woke up"" again and I was lying on my bed and I saw my mother standing besides me. Now I woke up for real. I opened my phone and I was watching Breaking Bad. So I never woke up after the lucid dream. So it was all just a dream."
791,"So I read many SP stories and I wanted to experience it, but it (for me) was a big mistake...",Sleepparalysis,0,"So I loved watching videos of scary stuff, like SP stories, and always wondered what It would be like to HAVE one of this episodes...

I’m 13 and I live in a moderately huge house with both my parents. My sister had just turned 20 and moved out, so now I was the only one with a room upstairs. My little brother’s and parents’ rooms are all downstairs, meaning the only thing accompanying me up here now are the movie room and a few bathrooms.

Personally I was always afraid of the movie room at night because the actual screen is broken and you can always hear the mechanics trying to pull up the projector screen at night and it’s so freaking scary. One time my sister went in there and beat the crap out of it trying to get it to stop beeping and whirring while we were trying to sleep, and it ended up almost pulling her hand into the rollup box. Ever since, I feared that thing the most.

Anyway, past explaining what the setting was, now onto my actual story.

I was trying to sleep after being up all day and I finally fell asleep laying the opposite of my door. I didn’t know what time it was, but I woke up sometime between 5 and 6 because the sun was just coming up. I tried reaching over to grab my phone but I couldn’t move. In my mind, I was like, “Oh my gosh I’m finally experiencing sleep paralysis, this is cool!” That lasted for about a second until I heard a noise coming from the movie room and sounds of chains tearing. Something cut through the wall and the freaky machine was suddenly laying on my floor. The sun went down and it fell into complete darkness. I could hear my mom calling my name but I was terrified to do anything; I couldn’t even DO anything. Then my light came on and the machine was tearing up my left leg by rolling it into the little box. I sat there and stared at it eating away at my leg for at least 25 seconds before I was able to scream. After that, I woke up. Ever since that night, I literally begged my parents to get a new system and move my room downstairs with them, and/or switch it with my little brother’s room.

My morale is:
Don’t wish for sleep paralysis if you’re afraid of something in a room next to you, please."
792,"I commented here yesterday and a lot of people here seems to have similar experiences, and I got curious and wanted to ask 2 questions",Sleepparalysis,10,"So do you guys think it has something to do with demons and second have you ever felt like walking somewhere in your house, while being asleep on your bed while also during SP? 

I had a period where it happened a lot, as if my soul was out of my body, I would always think that I was awake, unfortunately never tried looking on my bed to see if my body was there, it usually happened when no one was in the house.."
793,Sleep paralysis while sleeping on sidw,Sleepparalysis,4,Last night I had sleep paralysis while sleeping on my side.  As far as I remember it's always been while sleeping ony back.  I didn't see any figures like I sometimes do.  Is this common to experience sp on your side? Or in any position?
794,Could you see sleep paralysis demons if you have a blanket over your head?,Sleepparalysis,9,just curious
795,Sleep aid,Sleepparalysis,3,"Hey r/sleepparalysis, So I've been having sleep paralysis quite frequently this year. My first case of sleep paralysis was about a year ago, and since then I've been getting it 2-3 times a week on average. There was a period where it stopped for 3 months, then came back even worse.   


From personal experience, I would say I get sleep paralysis more than a lot of you. I tried talking to my doctor about SP but he didn't even know what it was really and I had to explain it to him. After a few months of bringing it up here and there, he recommended that I take prazosin. He told me it was used to treat people with PTSD and also night terrors. I was abit skeptical at first, but this stuff has really helped. I still get sleep paralysis but it happens like once a month to ever 3 weeks. Not multiple times a week now.   


Tbh I wouldn't recommend taking this is you only get SP a few times out of the year, but if you are having chronic sleep paralysis like I am ( 2-3 times a week, every week) I would recommend this. It has helped me a lot. I am also a very vivid dreamer, something that I do enjoy, and the medication has made me dream a lot less. (Well at least makes me not remember my dreams. Everyone dreams even if they don't remember it) I don't know if I am still having sleep paralysis and not remembering it or what, but it has helped me.  


So If you are having chronic SP and are at wits end, maybe this can help."
796,Sleep paralysis - a good experience,Sleepparalysis,3,"Hey guys, I decided to turn into Reddit about this subject as I haven't found anything similar to my own experiences.
Most people see bad things, and have some sort of panic while experiencing sleep paralysis. But does everyone have an and experience?

I had it a few times in my life, but only recently I came to my senses what was actually happening. Basically with me I feel like my body is extremely heavy.  Try to sit (feels physical but it isn't I guess) and it's like my body is bending back from all the weight that I feel on top of me.
Specially my head feels like it's so bended back that I feel the back of my head touching my back.
I try to sit on my bed (as I am half laying down on bed), but the pressure is so extreme that I feel I'm about 30 to 45° sitting.

I had some other different experiences, but I would like to know if you guys ever had anything similar.

Please share if you know what I'm talking about it, or if you also have some non negative sleep paralysis experience.

Thank you!"
797,Sleep paralysis (Not as severe and no nightmare,Sleepparalysis,0,"So this is happening June 16 2020. My first ""sleep paralysis"".

From what I'm reading from the other posts, it seems that everyone had a nightmare that was happening to them and they could not move their body. This was actually totally different from my experience today.

I was in my dream and it was a sort of ""another life"" dream that I was having. (This one was more believable in terms of reality). I chose to walk down the hallway and was about to turn a corner when I blinked and suddenly could not open my eyes. It was as if a force on my eyelids were glued together. Then I realized  that my mouth was open and I could move my tongue to stick out. So I stuck out my tongue trying to wake up my body, but I couldn't.

I wasn't thinking about moving my arms and legs because I just forgot to try and move them. I tried to go back to sleep. And woke up some time around 7 am. My dream didn't jolt me out of it like others have experienced, or maybe what I had was not sleep paralysis. I did not have any sort of nightmare or any confusion of reality and dream. I never had any hallucinations or hearing sounds, voices, etc. Only the unable to move eyes and possibly body(did not think to try and move my body at time)

Maybe someone has a similar experience like this? Can you call this sleep paralysis or is it something similar?"
798,The sleep demon took my boyfriend’s shape,Sleepparalysis,2,"Hello everyone, this is my first time posting here... I’ve already had some SP episodes in the past and a few more during the past months. What I’d like to tell you is something new that happened a few days ago.

It was after a calm evening and my boyfriend was sleeping at home. Around 3 am, I woke up and my boyfriend’s face was at ten centimeters from mine, we were facing each other and he was sleeping deeply. Suddenly, he started speaking a foreign langage that sounded a bit like german so I started laughing because I had never heard him doing something like that and he doesn’t speak a word of such a language. Then it begins to become a bit more scary : he opens his eyes and I realize the way he stares at me is very different from usual. I wake up a first time and see him in the exact same position... sleeping. Suddenly he starts grumbling again and grabs me. I then start to feel a very unpleasant pressure on the navel (as he was pushing his finger into it) until it hurts so much I can’t breathe anymore. That’s the moment I understand I’m switching alternately from reality to dream, but the moment I fall asleep is unnoticeable. The more I alternate the two states, the more the monster shaped as my boyfriend becomes violent and the less I am able to wake up. I remember clearly screaming as loud as I could and even pushing him back ( I sense his skin and flesh against my hands, I even feared I could hurt him in real life )… But of course I was laying still and all of that didn’t happen.

Does anyone here ever had a similar intercourse with the sleep paralysis monster?"

802,Can sleep paralysis be combined with a lucid dream?,Sleepparalysis,5,"I just woke up from the most terrifying experience of my life. I felt so tired that i immediately fell asleep on my couch but i started seeing things i was thinking about and none of them were pleasant. I still remember seeing the side of my couch whenever i wanted to but i didnt know if that was a dream? Every single thing i was terrified of every bad memory was there in front of me too. You know how they say lucid dreams are where you can control everything and it sounds like a super fun thing to experience but no, this was terrifying or i made it terrifying i dont know. Then i saw myself awake on the bed but hearing very fast inaudible whispers, and every time i felt awake i was super tired. I’ve had sleep paralysis before but not this intense. I’m wondering if its just a really bad lucid dream?"
803,Months without one and this happens,Sleepparalysis,1,"My online classes in film school (I'm from Chile) stopped so I have way less things to do and I usually get psychological stress when that happens.
I also committed the mistake to sleep with my back straight up and not from the side cuz I falled sleep meditating.

Strangely started with music, there wasn't any but I heared like I had headphones on, then I listened my father's angry voice and aggressive steps (my house is made of wood so steps always make noise) like he was coming to yell at me for listening to music at this hour (I'm 20, and my father is not violent btw).

Then I understood I was in a paralysis, didn't open my eyes cuz I don't wanna see creepy stuff but still heared my brother voice from his room screaming for help and felt 4 hands over me, two were asfixiating me and the lther two were on my pelvis making me feel uncomfortable just by touching my legs.
Also, it felt like it had some sort of religious evil to it, I can't explain it very good, but it felt like that.

             When I was only five, my dreams melted into reality. Problems in a household can only lead to some sort of stress induced effects.  Some included a hallucination.               My grandmother would be there with me ""actually there"" but included with my. Woke dreaming … Small machines, working seamlessly with tiny clockworks. They would be in small balls, hovering around my bed… taunting me. Like they would kill me at any moment. .. I was scared shitless. I think I was only five or six years old, tops.                                                                            My grandmother was very religious and would invoke God to make them go away. Surprisingly, she did always help.  Looking back her warmth, she carried me then, emotionally as well as physically.. even with her gone, she always will.                                                                                               I was brought up in a religious manner.

809,SP since i was 14,Sleepparalysis,7,"Hello all! dont post often but i felt compelled to as it may help me or someone else to feel better knowing we are not alone.

My first SP would start with typical paralysis and only hearing voices of a woman barely whispering, this went on for a while. i was 14.

sometime after that as i would have sp at least once a week i started to see the woman.(this is the first encounter) i would be frozen completely stuck in my bed, awoken out of no where always around 3:00 AM. she would wait, taunting me and snickering at me behind my bed, she than showed herself to me. a woman who looked like she was made of tree branches, she always has a menacing grin on her face. she waved at me and i went back to sleep(felt like i was drugged) had a horrible nightmare than woke up for the next day.

from than for a couple weeks i would see her over and over, since i was used to the SP i could move a little bit, and to be completely honest every time im IN a sleep paralysis experience, im never scared at the time, im only scared the next night to see her again. (i did have enough strength to flick her off once and laugh back she went batshit crazy and started clawing at me uncontrollably while screaming. but she couldnt reach me, just at the edge of my bed clawing and angry she couldnt hurt me)

&#x200B;

the next time (After the flicking her off incident) i had sleep paralysis,  i woke up to a bright white light next to me (haha i have tears in my eyes thinking about this right now) she whispered to me ""go back to sleep"" and she kissed me so gently on my forehead i had never felt anything more real, even from a real kiss. that night i had the most restful sleep i had had in years, and the demons wouldnt come as often (almost never really)

&#x200B;

well now im 18 and a couple days ago they seem to be returning to their frequent visits (i believe this is because of my drug use) yesterday a bald man with a deep voice towered over me at the side of my bed and he kept repeating ""i have full control over you now"" ""i have full control over you now"". as i said i can move just a bit in my SP but this time i was glued to the bed, thats when i noticed the other demon at the edge of my bed holding his hand out like he was causing me to not move. as a reaction this (i never make concious decisions in SP as it feels im still really dreaming, but i remember it the next day) i started growling at the man, showing my teeth like a wild animal i guess i didnt know what else to do and instinct took over.

&#x200B;

i tried to keep this as short as possible! sorry about the length and thank you for reading guys, do you think your SP has some spiritual element or do you think its all science and your brain type deal. please let me know!"
810,Short for dead and sleep paralyse,Sleepparalysis,0,"I got a lot of sleepparalyse since years. Some days ago I talked with a girl and told her my story. And she said a interesting thing... 
when I was little I was short do dead because I was drowned. 
And she said maybe I was so near to death and the afterlife...that with this moment I opened a door and take it in my life & maybe that’s the reason why ghosts and demons are in my life... 

Anyone else has experience something like this & now has sleeppaaralysis?"
811,Traumatic events and SP/lucid dreams,Sleepparalysis,4,"I recently had a traumatic experience involving cocaine and what appears to have been a panic attack, as I went to the doctor to check and there was no indication of a heart attack or any more serious problem.

After that day, I started to have sleep paralysis several times, and I would like to share some of these episodes.

&#x200B;

First episode:

I lay down to sleep and within a few minutes I went into a strange state of paralysis. I was in my room and the colors were beige like sand, and I heard a strong wind noise as if I were inside a whirlpool. I felt that I was floating just above my body and was trying desperately to wake up. I quickly heard a female voice saying ""I came to get you"", and then I woke up.

&#x200B;

Second episode:

Like the first, colors and the sound of the wind started and I realized that I was in a state of paralysis again. I was slowly floating on top of my body and went into despair, overcome by a strong fear of losing control. After a few minutes of trying to wake up, I did it.

&#x200B;

Third episode:

I fell asleep and went into a lucid dream state, where I was exactly in my room, in my bed, with the light on. It felt like I was talking to someone and that person was saying to me something like ""you are dreaming again, the light will always be there, you just don't go towards it"". There was a very large black spot on the ceiling in the corner, which looked like no demonic entity or figure, or anything that resembled human forms. When the person finished speaking, in a blink of an eye the black shadow was right on top of me, very close to my face, which caused me a huge fright and made me wake up.

&#x200B;

Other episodes:

I had some other brief moments of paralysis, always involving this dark yellow / beige color, with a strong wind noise. The feeling is to be on another plane, in the same physical place, but in a different dimension. Sometimes people are talking, sometimes I'm alone and I try to wake up desperate until I can.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During that period I had some bizarre dreams, some even funny now, but at the time it was pretty scary. The most vivid and striking was the following:

I was in a subway cafeteria eating a disgusting hamburger, which looked like it was made with very poor quality ingredients and a lot of oil. There were some girls there and I started to interact with them, suddenly we were talking about going to my house to have sex and things started to get weird, they started laughing between them and saying things like ""today you are going to eat a lot of pussy"", and suddenly they became men dressed as women. One of them cornered me on a wall and said something I don't remember, but the feeling was extremely desperate and I started to feel short of breath and a twinge in the back of my right rib, which made me wake up.

I know, I mean, what the fuck?

I've always had very vivid dreams all my life, but things are starting to get really weird.

Does anyone have similar experiences? Something like lucid dreams and paralysis after a traumatic event?

812,Sleep paralysis or did this happen,Sleepparalysis,13,"I have had only one instance of sleep paralysis when I was initially falling asleep. Last night, however; I brought home a date to stay the night and after being asleep, I woke at around 3 am I couldnt breath and I opened my eyes to what I saw was his wrist under my jaw and I swear I could feel his hand around my neck. He was awake. He pulled away and turned over. I turned over and grabbed my bedside knife not knowing if this really just happened I didnt want to grab my gun. I waited with knive tucked to my side. I asked if he was ok and he said yes he couldn't sleep because he had a headache and he pulled away. He sounded angry and the muttered something; Idk what. I asked what had happened last night and he told me he couldnt sleep from the headache and a sunburn from earlier. He was in fact awake. Did this man choke me in my sleep or was this sleep paralysis. I asked him if he choked me and he had a slight grin and said no. Beyond a shook rn."
813,first SP in years,Sleepparalysis,1,"I've had SP a few times a few years ago, it was terrifying but once I learned what it was and how to deal with it, it went away. I am now recovering from surgery and because of that only able to sleep on my back. I'm one week in and sleeping was fine, though it wasn't exactly comfortable. This morning however, I woke up in SP after trying to go to sleep again. I didn't see anything, I never did, but I did hear all kinds of different voices talk to me. Some were nice, some were toying around with me and a few were terrifying, they just seemed evil and it was like they wanted to take me to a horrible place. I got out of it pretty quickly, since I knew what to do, and thought I would be able to sleep again. But every time I started to fall asleep again, the voices would come back. They would start out okay with only the nicer voices talking, and then all of the sudden the evil ones would come back and I would be paralyzed again. I've never had SP so many times back to back in one night, so I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this. Is this just one session I had to go through, or should I deal with it it differently than just trying to go to sleep right after it happened?"
814,Terrifying SP,Sleepparalysis,2,"Within the last month, I’ve had two experiences with SP. Both times I have been dreaming and I’m aware that I’m dreaming but I can not wake up at all. The first time, I was trying to wake myself up but it was like something was pinning me down. When I finally was able to wake up, my body felt like it was vibrating and my heart was beating fast. My anxiety was through the roof and I felt like I just got done running as fast as I could.

The second time was just earlier this morning and it was all the same except, in my head, I was trying to tell my husband to help me up and I was screaming it in my head but I couldn’t actually say anything out loud. I finally shot up and scared the crap out of my husband. My body again felt like it was vibrating and I was hyperventilating. Before these times, it’s been about 10 years since the last time I had experienced this. It’s been terrifying and it makes me scared to go to sleep. 

I know these dreams were vivid but it’s like it all just disappears as soon as I wake up. 🤦🏻‍♀️"
815,SP from tiredness/ can anyone relate?,Sleepparalysis,0,"I guess I'm just sharing my experiences bc I  would like to communicate it. But usually, when this happens to me (since it's happened a handful number of times) I can wiggle my fingers or toes before it takes me over completely. Also, it usually happens when I'm lying flat on my back. 

Oh the most important part is that it has happened (until last night) exclusively in the bed in my room (LOL it's probably haunted). BUT only twice have I heard anything ( my name, and to be quiet), but thankfully I have never seen anything/anyone. I'm also not sure how I end up back to sleep because in my right mind, i would be too freaked out to sleep in the same place.

However, last night I was sleeping in a different place on my stomach. I didn't expect it to happen because it never has before like that, and twice I fought it off because I didn't want to experience it anymore. But the third time I felt it happening, I gave in and oddly it felt like something was being pulled out of my back, but didn't quite make it (can anyone relate? my soul?) But yeah I had a pretty vivid dream/vision and it felt more pleasant than other SP occasions because I actively tried to stay calm and was saying affirmations in my head the entire time.

That was a lot, but yeah if anyone can relate, lmk. thanks!"
816,My sleep paralysis from stress,Sleepparalysis,1," The first time I had sleep paralysis, I was on my last grade of elementary school. It was after I had been on a surgery and I had tons of exams to do and I was really stressed out about it. When I woke up at night, the first thing I saw was a silhouette of a man on the corner of my room. I didn't know what was going on and I thought some random person was in my room. It was too big to be my mom and my father doesn't live with us. The silhouette started to approach me and I was really scared. When the silhouette was right above me, it started to back down. It went back to the corner of my room. Then it started to approach me again and it did the same thing several times before it disappeared and I could move again. I couldn't sleep very well for the rest of the night. I didn't even know that sleep paralysis was a thing before and got to know about it the next day at school when my classmates were talking about it. I was like, ""holy shit I had a sleep paralysis last night"", and hoped I'd never got one again.

Three years go by and I'm on my last grade of junior high school. It was Christmas holiday and the finals would be coming at spring. I was again stressing pretty much about all the exams and the fact that I would have to decide where and what I would want to study, since I had no idea. Before the second time I had the sleep paralysis, I had a really bad nightmare first. In that nightmare I was running away from some big and weird man. When the man got hold of me, the nightmare would start again. It didn't matter how fast I ran or where I hid and no matter what I did or where ever I escaped, the man would eventually get me and the dream would start over. I was scared for my life and I could even feel the panic physically. After god knows how many times the dream started over, I woke up to the fact that I was screaming. Or, at least trying to scream. No sound came from my mouth and I was trying to gasp air as much as I could. I couldn't move and I looked every where I could and I could feel my panic from the dream rushing back. My heart was beating fast and for a while I thought I would suffocate, but then I could see a black silhouette from my corner of eye. It was hushing me and saying things like, ""it's okay"", before sitting on my bed next to me. It's hand was slowly but soothingly patting my head while it hummed and I felt myself calming down. After calming down it got easier to breathe and I couldn't hear my heart beating anymore in my ears. Just like the first time, I didn't realise I was having sleep paralysis and I honestly thought that the silhouette was just my mom who had somehow heard me. After a while I fell asleep again. When I woke up at the morning I asked from my mom if she had heard me on previous night. At first my mom looked confused and then laughed that she had slept like a rock. I came quickly to that conclusion that I indeed had had an another sleep paralysis.

I think I got both of my sleep paralysis from stressing out so much. First time it was hella scary, second time it actually helped me to calm down. After that second time I haven't had anymore sleep paralysis and to be honest, I'm not that scared of them anymore."

818,i don't get creepy sht when i sp anymore: a story,Sleepparalysis,2,"Note: This my real experience with SPs. I didn't want to share them but thought, maybe I could help someone. Or maybe someone out there just wants to learn/read more on SP experiences.

&#x200B;

*Story:*

I was young when I first had an SP. I wasn't even aware of it but I felt a presence behind me that was so strong and *unsettling*. I wanted to turn around or run far, far away but I couldn't. It was terrifying. 

The second time it happened, it was years later. I felt my body paralysed. Fear gripping onto me and latching to every part of my body when I heard demonic laughter so close to my ears. It sounded if some man, no, *demon* enjoyed watching my fear eating me alive and my futile attempts to scream for bloody murder. That happened *twice*, only seconds apart before the I ran the moment I was able to move.

The worst part was that the more I was afraid, the more it was intense and the longer it held.

I had multiple S.P. from there on, sometimes multiple times a week. Each and every one of them was filled with helplessness and suffocating fear. But for every event, I learned. I learned what was real and what was not. I learned the exact moment I was about to fall into S.P. and managed to drag my ass out of the bed. But of course, I sometimes fail. It's a hard battle to yank yourself out.

For each and every event,  I kept telling myself it wasn't real and that it was merely just illusions from my brain. Therefore, I started to fear less and less.

Then, it was one night? or was it a day? that I had another S.P. event. I felt huge spider limbs crawling onto me. I immediately wanted to run but I couldn't. I started to realise that it was not real but yet it does feel so real. Too real, I guess that's why it's so unsettling. I wanted to scream but I was just so damn tired so instead--

I imagined it massaging my body. It felt damn good. It was shortlived however when I felt every single limb snap one by one. Then, it was gone. I could move.

Now, every time I get S.P.'s I don't see, hear, nor feel all those terrifying stuff. It's just plain paralysis. Now, I'm not complaining because I am for sure relieved for not having to experience those again. It's just that, it was such a good massage.

&#x200B;

**What I learned: Don't be afraid. They aren't real and they can't hurt you. If they do then that's next-level stuff that you should definitely seek for help.**

*TL;DR:* The moment I stopped fearing SP's and started to imagine them doing something nice or funny, it quickly disappears."
819,Does anyone else experience light in their eyes as a trigger for SP??,Sleepparalysis,5,"I have read lots about how sleeping on your back makes SP more likely (same for me), but haven’t been able to find anyone discuss light in their eyes as something that can also trigger it. I usually only get sleep paralysis when I nap, and if there’s any sort of ambient light hitting my eyes (like sunlight coming through the window or if I accidentally fall asleep with the lights on), I know I am definitely going to slip into SP. As such, I try remember to nap with a mask over my eyes, which usually does the trick to stop it. Just curious if anyone else experiences this correlation between light and SP?"
820,"Vivid hallucination, medical or spiritual event? Sleep paralysis?",Sleepparalysis,2,"I wrote this out to document my first experience last night. I’ve never had sleep paralysis, don’t dream much, and rarely have nightmares when I do. I’ll preface this with a few details. I’ve been sick with what I can only assume to be covid19 since March. I’ve been feeling generally better but having a lot of inflammation everywhere. The dog that I mention we had for 7 years, he was my best buddy and he sadly crossed the rainbow bridge about two weeks ago. Also, like much of the world right now, my stress and anxiety levels have been pretty high. 

Last night I went to sleep watching tv. My breathing and heartbeat feels weird, but it has been for the last several days. Body begins to vibrate, increasing gradually.

Tunnel vision imagery of Marley playing in the backyard of our old house. Looks like looking through binoculars backward and is blurry like I’m not wearing any glasses or contacts. Images begin to change shape into a curved bridge composed of the different images and it flowing at a fast rate. I’m seeing the images from above now and I feel my body begin to lift and go forward in the same direction and speed as the images. This stops suddenly and I now see our bedroom but as if in 3rd person. My eyes are closed and I cannot move. My breathing has slowed and my breaths are shallow, my heart begins to beat very hard and increasingly fast. In the corner I see a black shadow figure, it almost looks to be human in shape but has the fluid movement of a cloud. As soon as I see the figure it suddenly appears much closer now and is sitting at my side. I feel what I can best describe as a hand, but much larger, place itself on my abdomen. A sudden, extreme rush of euphoria overcomes my entire body. The closest example I can compare to is receiving IV morphine in the hospital, it was an immediate effect. I no longer can feel my heart beat and I don’t notice myself breathing. I begin to feel very warm but in a euphoric, summer sun shining on you first thing in the morning feeling. The figure begins to pull a large glowing reddish-orange ball from my abdomen. It does not hurt, the more the ball of light comes out the more euphoric I begin to feel. Behind the figure I see the walls of the bedroom change into different scenery and patterns, mostly desert and sand. The figure conceals the ball within itself and floats out of the room, taking me with it. I begin to feel as if I am floating above my body, first slowly, then at jet speed. After that it’s blank, I wake up and it’s around 1:30 am and I’m drenched in sweat. 

So far today the long list of Symptoms I have been experiencing over the last month, and some of the worst being within the last week, all appear to be either gone or unnoticeable."
821,I don’t know what this was but I can’t find anything about it so I thought I’d ask here..,Sleepparalysis,5,"When I was 17 yrs old or so (I’m now 25) I had a pretty traumatic experience.. I fell asleep in my living room when suddenly I start sleep walking, but I’m awake watching. I can’t control my body but I’m able to see what’s happening. So I start walking to my bedroom and stand in front of my dresser for a moment or so. I then reach into my drawer and pull out Acetone (nail polish remover) and start walking back to the living room where i was sleeping. I then opened the bottle and started to drink it slowly. As soon as the bottle touched my lips, I started panicking and tried to stop what I was doing but I couldn’t get my body to wake up and stop. Finally about 2 or 3 drinks in, my body broke free and I was able to move. I started crying uncontrollably and ran to the kitchen which was right next to me and shoved my finger down my throat and was able to throw it back up. My throat was on fire and I was just so scared and shaking uncontrollably. My mother heard me crying so she rushed into the kitchen and once I told her what happened, she didn’t really know what do but to offer that she take me to the hospital. I knew for sure I threw it all up, in contrast to how much I drank just then vs how much I threw up.. She stayed up with me until the morning to make sure I was okay and then I went back to sleep in the living room while she stayed up and kept an eye on me until I was rested. 

I was taking college classes at the time as part of a high school program and I had a psychology professor that I saw the next day so I thought I might ask her take on it. She said scientifically, the only explanation would be that I was thirsty and my sleep walking self went to get a drink. She said that’s all she could say from a scientific standpoint but that she’s never heard of anything like what I told her before and basically just be careful and to have someone near me when I’m sleeping for a little while just to be safe.

I know that was a little long but has anyone heard of or dealt with this kind of thing before? To this day it still scares the shit out of me. What if I try hurt myself or my fiancé one night while I’m sleeping? It’s just always at the back of my mind..."
822,Sleep paralysis when sleeping alone,Sleepparalysis,1,"I tend to get sleep paralysis when I’m sleeping alone (I work different different shifts than my partner every other month). It absolutely freaks me out and I focus all of my energy on rolling over or sitting up to wake up (it’s extremely hard to do). I don’t get weird visions or hallucinations at least, it’s mostly a feeling like a huge weight on me and breathing seems difficult. 

However, I’ve been trying to stay calm and to turn it into a lucid dream gateway but I can’t seem to stay calm enough because I want to wake myself up due to the sensation of feeling smothered. Any advice? 

If I become aware in dreams, I can normally become lucid but I can’t seem to use sleep paralysis as a way to do this because I’m so used to waking myself up when it happens."
823,Someone or something stepped on my Back,Sleepparalysis,1,"I usually sleep at 1:30 AM, but I was falling sleep at 11 PM yesterday. First, I dreamt about watching some white worms on the ground outaide my house. I woke up and searched for that dream meaning... and there it is... Dreaming with a lot of worms means that  an intriguing person is putting to much attention on you.

Then, as usuaI, I was watching youtube videos to fall sleep... (It's very rare for me to fall sleep while laying upside down, but it happened) . Then the SP occurred:

.I was on my bed, on the same poaition I was sleeping, Dark room as always, very peacefull when suddenly felt something jumped at my BED (at this momment I knew I was dreaming beacause I have no pets at home) but... Maybe i forgot to close a window?... I tried to mové my legs to scare the damn whatever animal it was... But instead, it started to stomp my Back and making noises like somekind of demon or monter. FINALLY, that thing jumped through the wall and dissapearing instantly. I woke up,  Laying upside down without being  able to move my arms. I was feeling the pain of the stomps on my Back and having troubke to breathe

Now its 3:35 in Ecuador and I'm really nervous to sleep again. It's my first time dreaming somethin that scary that felt so Real.

My native language is Spanish.. Sorry for the big wrtiting mistakes."
824,My Army of Stuff Animals Doesn't Work Anymore,Sleepparalysis,9,"A little context since I was in gradeschool I always sleep with a lot of stuff toys in my bed since I have re occuring nightmares of dying from an accident or someone killing me. Ever since then I always have a stuff animal to keep me company it sounds so childish but it help me through the years but this time it's different.

So for the past days I didn't sleep normally (i usually sleep at 11pm and wake up at 8 am) Trying to distract myself with games cause my dreams are getting worst recently. But tonight I decided to fix my messed up body clock and slept early. 

It's 3 in the morning here and I just woke up to the most messed up dream ever. My dream was just me staring into nothingness but then I felt like I can't breathe like I am drowning like someone is strangling me. I am literally in tears right now cause I dunno where to vent out. When I woke up from the nightmare it was just me strangling myself I was choking and already in tears. I can't control myself, I was literally strangling myself. I know I was hurting myself but I couldn't stop myself from doing it. It was like my hands were controlled by a different entity. Now my head hurts like hell from banging the headboard so that I would snapped out of it. I did snapped out of it. I feel so shitty and my neck hurts like hell and I'm afraid to go back to sleep now."
825,Yelling/screaming upon waking,Sleepparalysis,5,"I'd like to apologize in advance. This post might jump around a bit. I'm kind of nervous posting here and if I let myself read this over, I'd probably wind up deleting everything and forego posting all together.

I've been dealing with SP for the past 7 or so years. And even after all this time, it's still such terrifying experience. I never thought to search for an online community or support group before. I'm honestly so glad there's a sub dedicated to SP. I've been reading through some of your posts and it's been helping me cope a lot. 

When you're experiencing an episode of SP, do you make those weird, muffled/choked sounds when you're scared? Like when you're trying to yell for help or scream in terror and the sound comes out all... distorted? That's what happens to me, and 9/10 times it leads to me actually yelling/screaming in real life once I'm physically able to do so (i.e. no longer paralyzed). 

Normally it's just screaming, but I've woken up a few times shouting ""fuck you"" at my SP demon (I'll admit that I find this a little funny to me when I fully wake up in the morning). Those are the times when I'm repeatedly saying it (or attempting to that is) during the episode and then I'm assuming I just actually yell it out once I'm able to.

Last night was a little different though. I had an SP episode and when I woke up I was yelling ""[partner's name], help."" I've honestly never done that before. 

Is this normal? Has anyone else experienced any of the stuff I mentioned above too? What do you do? Why does this happen? I'd just like to know that I'm not alone in this.

It terrifies my partner whenever it happens. They usually always comfort me, but I hate that I wake them."
826,Idk what the fuck happened,Sleepparalysis,8,Ive had my share of nights with sleep paralysis so i usually break it pretty easily but last night as soon as i broke it i started floating and then got dropped down back to my bed and saw a black cloud with a face smile at me. And then after i got dropped down i got up from my bed i got slammed to the wall and then finally woke up like hours later but i swear that shit was to vivid to be a dream
827,Starting again,Sleepparalysis,9,"So, this is story is a bit of journey but I really need to get it off my chest, also I'm on mobile so the format might be off for some of you. 

I started getting sleep paralysis when I was really young so they didnt used to bother me anymore or cause any kind of fear I'd more just watch them as I feel asleep, but after almost 5 years after not experiencing them they've started again. They used to all be of the tall man in my doorway reaching for me, but since I bought a salt lamp and left it on over night I haven't had any problems. 

At the start of the year the bulb in the lamp burned out and I've been too lazy/always forget to buy a replacement. 

Which leads to last night; this was new to me because it wasn't the tall man in my doorway but an even taller and lanky body, almost like a jack in the box, crouched by my side of the bed. Technically last night wasn't the first time I've seen this before, the last few nights I've seen its face, weirdly the face from the cover of the first purge movie but with giant white eyes with tiny black pupils, coming towards me when I'd close my eyes to try and sleep. Last night though it was true paralyse where I couldn't move and I was unable to scream as it was pulling me off the bed. 

The weird thing about its face is that my fiance, who also used to have sleep paralysis but hasn't for awhile now, has started having them again since the lamp burnt out. Her's recently have also been pop culture references; the old lady from the bathtub in the shinning and a real life version of krusty the clown from the Simpsons. Her krusty also tried pulling her off the bed which has never happened to her before either. Also worth noting is that our roommate has also started having sleep paralysis for the first time in her life this year.

Last night's episode has scared me so bad that I've moved an old bible to beside my bed as well as a rosary. Now this is a big thing for me since I dont go to church anymore because I found it hard to believe in the church growing up with gender identity issues and being pansexual, but these things still bring me some form of comfort and even though I understand the science behind sleep paralysis I still find it good to know I have something to defend myself from something that feels so demonic."
828,The Lanky Man,Sleepparalysis,2,"***This is my first post in this subreddit, so please have some mercy on my soul.***  
***Also, English is not my mother tongue, but I will try my damnest to write comprehensible sentences.***

My story begins in 2014, the first time I discovered that I had to endure sleep paralyses. You probably should know that I always had problems falling asleep, most of the times I need up to atleast 1 1/2 - 2 hours laying still to finally doze off. I tried serveral ""cures"" to lessen this condition, so far nothing helped. These days I don't mind it, it's no big deal anymore because I learned how to live with it. But there is one happening I will never lay off, namely my first sleep paralysis.

I am almost 25 years old, 19 at the time this story takes place. Like always, I prepared to sleep by watching YouTube, and it just happened to be 1 AM in my country. I turned off my mobile phone, closed my eyes and did not move an inch (I hate moving around in bed and don't do it intuitively, so that's a given).

***That's where things went downhill.***

Something felt off. I was still awake, but I could not move my arms, legs and head. You get the idea. It seemed like I was fully functional mentally, but my body just shut down. At first, it was no big deal. Not being able to move while trying to do so sucks big time, but I wanted to sleep anyway so I couldn't care less. Hearing a sound that should not be audible however concerned me highly. I witnessed a rather metallic voice repeating ""Warum"" (German for ""why"") over and over again, getting faster as time went by. It was a little off, but my mind must have labeled it as being a dream so it wasn't that concerning to me.

***What happened next was more than concerning.***

There was a feeling I just wasn't able to leave behind. It gnawed at me, kept me alerted.The feeling of being observed by a stranger. I was terrified, being watched by others always startles me. Naturally, I had a room for myself by the time I turned nineteen, of course my twin sister could not share one with me at this age. But that in itself means there was no possibility someone, or rather something, was in my room. But there was. At first, I was not able to estimate the postion where that ""thing"" must have lingered, but it didn't take long for me to finally spot it. It was right next to me. Analyzed me with its big, empty eyes. Measured me with its long, bony fingers. That thing was huge, we are talking 6 feet 8 huge. It wasn't hostile at first, but it was **terrifying**. For more than half an hour (felt, wasn't exactly able to check the time) it just stared at me.

**Then it made it's move.**

The grotesque creature lunged at me, I was scared beyond recognition. The lanky man sat on my defenseless body, staring deliberately at my chest. Eerie sounds violated my mind (""Warumwarumwarumwarumwarum"") while I could do nothing to stop this twisted nightmare from happening. It felt like being eaten alive, it was damaging. I have seen my guts being ripped apart, albeit them being intact a few hours later.

**I woke up, but the fear remained.**"
829,My last nightmare was on his phone,Sleepparalysis,0,"I have been experiencing Sleep paralysis for some time now. Normally when I am frozen I can feel it like electricity throughout my body and very cold at the same time. Also when I get a visual hallucinations it’s normally grey ( like an overcast sky ) ghost or dark like a backlit figure.

This time it was a young man , he was sitting on the floor between my bed and my closet. There was light shining on him like he was in front of a screen and he had his head down.

It really looked like some guy was in my room looking at his phone. He saw me, looked startled for a second, and hopped on my bed rushed towards me to stare in my face. His movements were very cat like.

I screamed and woke up. I was feeling scared and very tired at the same time. Even tho the experience lasted a few seconds, and as I didn’t have time to try to move so I didn’t feel the electricity. 

I felt it might have been a vivid nightmare rather than SP and wasn’t sure I was awake.

I asked my kid if I screamed for real in my sleep the following day and was told I gasped. When I thought I shrieked.

830,"Why do I get sleep paralysis when my dreams reach a certain level of complexity, ie. become meta?",Sleepparalysis,0,"It's mainly when the dream becomes meta in a way it seems dreams can't handle.

For example, in the dream, if I experience something or think about something that's related to metaphysics or supernatural stuff (like reincarnation), I IMMEDIATELY go into sleep paralysis mode.

Another example (which just happened to me, around half an hour ago) is if I experience something complicated. This dream was about a person who could draw with their mind; they just had to think, and that would be drawn. But if a thought wandered into their mind, which they didn't intend to think, that would appear in the drawing too. So, because of that, 4 huge elephants appeared in the sky inside that painting. It was such level of complication and meta-ness that the dream couldn't handle it and I got another SP.

Why does this always happen?

My sleep paralyses are scary. I'm immediately pulled out of the dream, have full awareness of what is going on, I cannot move at all, and I'm constantly being dragged into a hallucination which feels like being dragged into literal hell. I don't see monsters, I don't feel something sitting on my chest; it's just scary by itself."
