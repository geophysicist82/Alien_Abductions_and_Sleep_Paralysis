0,25 Space Facts That Will Both Terrify And Amaze You,Abductions,0,0
1,BF hearing voices,Abductions,5,"So my boyfriend just shared with me his experience last night. Where he was trying to go to sleep but suddenly had the feeling of his whole body being electrocuted, and he couldn't move. Whilst he couldn't move, he began to hear voices, a lot of voices he described it as being at a dinner party. He says he couldn't distinguish what the voices were saying, or if the voices were male or female. He just said that there was a lot of them. So my first thought while hearing this was that maybe it was a form of sleep paralysis. But he swears that he was trying to go to sleep and couldn't. That's when it happened. and I've only heard people who've had sleep paralysis as not being able to move, but only seeing things in their room, like shadowy figures, not hearing things. Please reach out if anyone has any similar experiences or an explanation!"
2,Is Blue Ink a Sign?,Abductions,1,"When I was a teen I would go to my dads house every other weekend and I would sleep in his guest room. The window is probably 10 feet above the ground. One day I woke up and was in a very strange position. I was laying on my back with my arms and legs completely straight to my sides. I've never woken up like that before, I sleep on my stomach or my left side religiously. I felt very confused and anxious. I went to the bathroom and found what looked to be blue ink spots on my body in places that could not have gotten there from me. (My abdomen and thigh for example and none of my hands) I looked out of the bedroom window and the screen was knocked out into the frame, but the window was shut and the blinds were how they were the previous day. From that day on I've been scared to sleep by windows. Any thoughts?"

6,A childhood nightmare,Abductions,0,"I have only ever shared my recollections of a childhood nightmare I had when I was about 10 years old (28yo now) with a couple close friends for fear of sounding crazy for thinking it could have been an abduction. Unfortunately there are only a few things I recall from the nightmare - most importantly what I remember is that I was terrified for my life. 

I remember the nightmare in snapshots that may or may not be in logical order from start to end:

I recall that I somehow randomly awaken inside of an old metal ""cage"" (or cell?) with metal grated floors. It is a rather large room and I feel absolutely hysterical. I am screaming through the bars of the container I'm in, pleading to be let go. 

I recall being strapped to a table in a large grey and hazy room. 

I recall somehow escaping wherever I'm being held and I begin running for my life through what seems to be a very large, metal, and also somewhat deteriorated looking space craft. I have this sense that I'm being chased by something. 

I recall running through cavernous hallways, down metal stairways, past several cell-holding areas....the entire time I'm screaming and pleading to be left alone. I feel like I'm running through a maze with no end in sight. 

This part is kind of weird: I recall, in my escape, sliding down a very wide, steep, and very fluffy cloud-like slide. Whatever it was made out of, it was dense and the color pink.

I recall being recaptured but by what, I'm not sure. I beg whatever recaptured me to let me go. I'm somehow taken to what must of been the being in charge of the craft or in charge of my capture. I cry and plead to it to be released. 

That's all I really recall. It was one of those nightmares though that stays with you forever. I've never been able to visualize the things that were chasing me though."

8,"Abduction possibly around November 7, 1994 in Richardson Texas",Abductions,10,"Okay so this is kind of a wild one, when I was born my parents always had told me of a dream my mother had, right before she found out she was pregnant. The funny thing about this is, my father also had a similar dream about being abducted by aliens and running through the alleys with our neighbors the same night of my mother. 
It gets weirder my father is not the only one that shared the dream with my mother;
Women up and down the street and the street behind my parents, six women total known, all ended up pregnant and some shared similar dreams of aliens and being abducted right before finding out they were pregnant.
This would pinpoint the abduction, based off of my personal conception date, being around November 7, 1994.
My parents lived off of Oak Street in Richardson Texas. 

If anyone knows more about this possible sighting, abduction or shares experiences or maybe one of the other babies born around that time please reply to this. I am just curious to know more about why we are all so closely related, and see if we have any weird Commonalities, or interests besides just Our date of birth. 




TLDR;
my entire life since I was born my parents always told me a story about my mother being abducted by aliens, and all these women around the neighborhood had similar dreams and ended up getting pregnant around the same time. All of us being born days within each other. My birthday is July 31st 1995."
9,Jumping in feet first,Abductions,17,"I've written accounts of my experiences here in hopes that someone might recognize the elements of them. I wanted some assurance, I guess, that I wasn't alone. After reading what has been written, I find very few similarities to my own experiences, though there have been people which relate to one part or another separately from the rest.

I'm taking the plunge. This isn't a request for permission, or for your blessing; I'm just telling you what I plan to do, and I'm inviting you to journey with me if you so choose.

The events I described before were condensed versions. They were tightened, incomplete, and without the nuances of those situations. I've decided to write out the entire timeline from beginning to end. I've decided to write a book.

Before you condemn me, mind that I'm unlikely to sell a single copy. I've written a book before, and only 20 copies have been sold. I'm not doing this to become rich or famous. I simply have to tell the whole thing, and hope that someone out there reads it and understands. Maybe I'll be that small amount of affirmation for just one person, and that is more than reason enough to do it.

What I pose to you is this:

Would you like to read it as I go? I could easily post each chapter here, or even break it down into smaller parts. Every year should potentially be its own chapter, though the content of each year is so rich that it may take several chapters to get through 2012 alone.

I'm doing this, whether you read it or not.

Would you? Tell me truly."

12,Please tell me your abduction stories.,Abductions,6,"So, uh, I feel strange asking about your abduction stories. My buddy has recently gotten me interested in alien conspiracies. Now before I go any further I want to make it clear that I have, for the most part, always believed in aliens. I have never been abducted, that I'm aware of, and I have no intention nor want to be abducted. The thought really scares me. So back to my reasoning behind asking for your stories. I was reading about the ""Oregon 2018 encounter"" and noticed some of the references they had came from Reddit users. So I've found my way into this sub. I really only want to hear your stories because I'm genuinely curious. I'm not hear to laugh at you because I believe you. I almost want this to be like a therapy session only not just for you guys but for me also. I think hearing about what happened to you may help me cope with the thought of being abducted myself. I hope this doesn't come off as me just looking out for myself but I hope it helps you guys as well. I read that a lot of people feel better telling events of their life that they had bottled up. Please tell me."

20,Discord Server,Abductions,0,"Hey Abductees,

We are dedicated to unearthing the knowledge of the world that's unseen by the average person. Everything from extraterrestrials to spirits, the things that go bump in the night,  and the things we normally wouldn't believe even if we saw it broad daylight; these are the things we hope to enlighten masses to embracing. Our community started in 2017 when our old server owner was creating a documentary of Extraterrestrials. During this time we had flourished with a wealth of knowledge. But, In his search for the knowledge of the skies, he came across many obstacles such as shitposters and skeptics who would purposely muddy the waters, making it difficult to find the truth. During that period we were the discord channel for /r/aliens when most of the moderators there were inactive and it was full of toxicity. We then would regularly post here in /r/abductions. We fused with /r/bigfoot and /r/bigfootencounters shortly after as well. Now, as more people are becoming aware of the ET presence and are embracing the fact that, not only ETs, but the whole of the metaphysical world operates in capacities not usually picked up by our traditional 5 senses. We are hoping to expand and bring that knowledge back to the people willing to keep their minds open, and hope to expand our reality to something greater than our physical senses.

22,boy scouts missing time regression abducted by grays,Abductions,9,This happened to me and my friend Alex when we were both 13 years old at the time. This took place in the Poconos Pennsylvania in the summer of 1998. Our troop went up to the Poconos for the weekend. Once we got there before noon we all got off the bus and headed to spot that we were going to camp for. Once we got there the camp leaders got everybody's tents all set up. They told us that dinner was going to be ready around 5. They told to us that we could explore the woods. My friend and I grew up around the area we knew our way around it. So my friend and I went on trail not to far where we were camping. We were walking and talking about sports and school normal kids stuff. This was around 1 in the afternoon. Then all of a sudden we hear a  noise coming from the sky we  both looked and saw a silver disc a ufo. Then we both looked at our watches they said 3pm. We thought it was only a few seconds that went by. We didn't know that we lost two hours and have know idea what happened to the time. We didn't tell anybody because that they wouldn't believe us. We kept quiet and didn't talk about it. Years later I began to have nightmares about that afternoon. Finally I so a therapist to regressed me to what happened that afternoon with my friend. Under regression what happened was that the ufo we saw in the sky landed in the woods about five feet from us. We tried to run but we couldn't then four gray aliens came out of the craft walked towards us. Then they took my arms and my friend's arms we walked to the craft into the ufo.  Once inside that aliens told me telepathy that you and your friend won't be harmed the told me that we to perform experiments on you boys I felt calm. Then we came to a room in the craft that looked a doctors office there were two tables once there the aliens told me telepathy that we have to take off your clothes for the experiments. I guess I said ok  then the aliens began to unbuttoned my shirt and the other two aliens were doing the same to me friend. Once out shirt came off the told us to lay down on the tables which we did then the started to remove our shoes socks unbuckled our pants and boxers off us. Once naked the told us the exam was about to start. Fist they started by taking some hair samples some blood from us and skin samples . Then came the sperm sample. They did us by taking a hose like device which had a suction cup from the ceiling. Placing it over my penis and my friend's as well. Somehow we both got an erection and our sperm went into this device. Once everything was done they told us that we could get redressed which we did. They brought us back to the spot where we were abducted from. We didn't tell anybody because they wouldn't believe us. I found out years later that my friend told he had experiences since he was little.

29,connecting the dots,Abductions,4,"The recent news from the pentagon has me going back over my unexplained experiences with new curiosity, and not so quick to pass them off as normal unconscious phenomena.

I’m just going to detail everything abnormal and potentially UFO related - let me know if anyone there has experienced similar phenomena.

I have a memory from when I was maybe ten years old. I woke up in the middle of the night and my whole room was bathed in a bluish light, there was a sound like a deep whirring. I petrified and had the sensation that someone was looking at me through the window but I was too scared to turn over in bed and look. As I remember it I just lay there waiting for it to go away, and I don’t recall how long that took.

This may be unrelated but I used to often wake up with something like cat scratches on my arms and torso. They were raised and red like I was I had an allergic reaction, but usually they would be gone within a day.

Then there was the UFO sighting four years ago. This was at a lake in Maine called Lucerne. I was with a friend stargazing on a paddle boat in the middle of the night. Three lights formed a straight line flying in close formation in the distance, hovering over the lake. We both saw it and pretty much freaked out. The lights then each moved indecently out of the straight line and formed a triangle directly over our heads. 

As I looked at the lights I had the instinct to take out my phone and take a video, but then as I reached for my phone I felt a powerful aversion to doing so. It was like a thought popped into my head that said, “no, don’t”. When I think about why at the time I didn’t take a video, I believe I thought that if I took a video then the moment would cease to exist. Like if I took out my phone, I would miss out on the tremendous experience I was having. 

After hovering overhead it drifted into the distance and disappeared behind the tree line. Immediately I had the sensation that I was wet. I reached and touched my face, convinced I was somehow drenched in water, but as I continued to feel my face I realized I was completely dry.

Now for the kicker and the reason I don’t tell most people this UFO story. At the time of the encounter I was coming down off of a psilocybin mushroom trip. And everyone I talk to (especially people who have never tripped) pass the encounter off as an obvious hallucination. I know what mushroom hallucinations are. This was not that.

Thoughts?"
30,3 experiences this week after several year hiatus,Abductions,7,"Just as the title states. Back in the early 2010s I had abduction experiences that were almost nightly and at the very least monthly. Then it seemed to taper off around 2013 and stopped all together until this week.

I’ve had good recollection of my experiences and the signs that surround them because I was heavy into daily, several hour long meditation sessions. Regularly exercising my brain I think helped me to to remember more than the average experiencer. I could remember things that happened while I was taken, not just the abduction itself. I’ve since fallen off the meditation wagon. I don’t remember seeing anything outright but I have lots of memory residue and signs this week that have me on edge now.

One tell tale for me is how my dream state is remembered. I usually have hyper vivid dreams with full recall and senses. When an abduction happens my dreams are distorted and hazy, and interrupted several times by jolting wide awake for only a few seconds before being slapped with complete blackness. Usually if I wake up in the middle of the night I have to go through a whole routine to fall back asleep. Get up, use the bathroom, drink water, etc. and still lay there for anywhere between half and hour to an hour before I can fall back asleep. It’s been this way for years now.

The blackness that hits during these experiences though is like being knocked out by a physical blow but with no pain. Just sudden BOOM darkness.

It took me a couple of days to figure out what was going on but even then it’s been so long I didn’t really believe it. The messed up dream states and blackness happened 3 times this week. But I also noticed 5 fresh bruises all over my arm and legs, all in similar stages of healing. I showed my partner who was equally disturbed. We have opposite sleep schedules and I often sleep alone. 

Then yesterday while at work I had splitting headache pain, but not in a spot I ever have one. It was in a tiny pinprick sized spot behind my right ear. Same spot ached all day, even if I have a migraine it will only last a few hours tops.

But the icing on the cake was this morning. I slept alone again and remembered having the weird hazy dreams, full alertness, then blackness a good 10 times during the night. I woke up absolutely exhausted like I didn’t actually sleep the night before. But I got up to start my day regardless only to freeze at my bedroom door.

I have a couple of small paintings hanging right next to the door frame, one was on the dresser and the other was tilted all crazy. Then right outside my doorway the long hallway rug was bunched up several times, pushed back away from my door like something had been dragged through the doorway and down the hall. All together it looked like a crazy struggle had gone down in my bedroom doorway.

My partner didn’t hear anything but had fallen asleep on the couch in the early AM in the living room. They wouldn’t have pranked me as they are a very “no nonsense” person who doesn’t believe in anything paranormal. I’ve also never told them about my experiences. 

I’m curious if anyone else has had long periods of being left alone before sudden frequent visits or if anyone else is experiencing an alarming amount of experiences this week.

Thanks everyone."
31,Hear me out...,Abductions,13,"Not my story, I have been studying the person's account and he didn't mind me sharing his words:

Sorry, its a long read and I tried to keep it vague and short.

I always considered myself to be a rather intelligent man, having honors grades and graduating as my class valedictorian, I went on to become a doctor and spent 22 years in the Army, as a biologist. I have since retired from the military and have a private practice in my small town (which ill keep anonymous along with any names).
I've always believed in the prospect of alien life, but as for visiting aliens, I guess I never gave it much thought. However, the idea of alien abduction seemed down right ridiculous to me.
Trying to stay fit, when weather permits I like to walk to my office. Its about 3/4 a mile away and the walk allows me to get some exercise and a sweet view of the north pacific landscape. Usually a nice, relaxing walk thats typically uneventful. 
This day starts off like the rest. I left home early in hopes to get some quite time alone at the office, it was about 6 a.m. when i left home. I walk up the hill about halfway there and I see 3 kids up ahead in the distance. I can see they have some sort of flying toy above them...this was my impression from a distance.
They were out of sight while I approached but soon were in view and maybe 100 feet away. I remember thinking this was odd...then just fell asleep.
I dont know how long I was out for but I woke up and was on a bed. I remember thinking I must have passed out on my walk and they took me to the hospital...i got the impression of a medical setting due to the smell and super clean environment i found myself in.
I was having a hard time focusing my eyes and ears on the people around me. I took a minute but I finally was able to see that I was looking at this person's back. He turned around and I went into absolute shock.
This person looked like a man, but was certainly not human. The eyes gave it away. Large almond shaped eyes, with very vibrant purple color. The head was larger but not like people tend to picture an alien looking like. THEY LOOKED VERY HUMAN, but obviously not.
I was in panic, I jumped up and grabbed some sort of tool to defend myself. They backed off, and looked quite afraid. They're pupils were getting bigger and smaller at a rapid pace. One of them stepped forward and spread his arms out, as to protect his crew. I quickly ran off down a hallway.
I found myself in a narrow hall with doors on the left. I took the first door and as soon as I entered, bam! I found myself right back where I started. This time I went to the second door, bam!! Same thing.
I fell to my feet, trying to catch my breath and I'm sobbing and just freaking out. I remember I touched my hands to the floor and when i lifted my hands it was see through, for a few seconds and went back to metal. At this point I realized that I was in the air...i started to hyperventilate...it took me a minute, but I gather myself and realize that I'm going to need to confront these beings, in order to get home.
I get up and head back to them. As I approach one of them stands forward and presents me with a glass like, rectangular thing...picture a tablet device made of crystal with liquid colors inside.
He puts a hand of it and presents it to me, as if I should do the same. So I did. Instantly we were connected and communicating...not like words but thoughts, transfered from him to me. I knew what he wanted me to know, and vice versa. (I'll elaborate later).
Our communication did not last long, however the information was vast...like a very long conversation if we had spoken instead of using this amazing device. Afterward I was ushered into a room where there was a young girl in maybe her early 20s. She was sobbing on the floor holding her knees...""this must be a dream..."" she said, among other ramblings. I noticed that the wall on one side was made of glass and had separated cages built into it. Most of the cages were empty. The first cage, however had an odd animal. Small and furry like a dog is, but winged. Although it didn't seem these wings would be adequate for flying. Thus animal had a elephant like snout, or trunk. When it stared at you it would make you nauseous. Another cage had a regular earthly Labrador and one cage had a ""typical grey alien"" in it, he was either dead or asleep. Looked like it was just thrown about in this cage and never moved again.
At some point I'm fighting off an urge to go to sleep...it became too strong and I passed out. I woke up outside and the same ball of light I saw the ""kids"" on the path with, was floating above me. It shot up in the air straight up and was gone. Call me nuts but I think that ball of light, the size of a basketball, was their ship. Inside it was as big as a shopping mall.
During our communication period he explained that they come from a planet close to death. The remaining population that does live on the home planet are mostly those trying to save the planet. All the animals in the wild died off and most water poisoned. These beings go investigate planets with intelligent life and see how they address planetary issues, and what technologies they have that would help their efforts. They are interested in our animals and oceans.
Once they discovered humans they began to theorize that they evolved from beings that were once in a human-like state and believe earth is destined to end up like their planet if big changes aren't made soon.
Now I never would have even got past the second paragraph of this story was I asked to read it, but I promise you this is true. Im a medical doctor in a small town and going public may adversely effect my practice, also I dont want to be the face of this phenomenon. However, as a scientist I ask that you leave yourself open enough to see the facts and consider the real truths about this phenomenon."
32,Alien Experiencer Participants Needed for Research,Abductions,6,"Hello!

I am currently completing thesis research work for my master’s degree at the University of Regina in the Department of gender, religion and critical studies and am looking for participants who are Canadian citizens or residents, aged 18 and older (19 and older if outside of Alberta), to complete a short online survey about experiences with alien abductions and contact! The survey will take approximately 20 minutes to complete and includes some demographic questions and some more detailed questions regarding participants’ alien abductions/contact. I am especially interested in those who have had sexual or reproductive aspects involved in their experiences! Questions include themes of sexuality, sexual interactions, and reproduction. All answers and information are kept confidential.

I am also looking for volunteers to be interviewed after the completion of the survey. All interviews are confidential as well! The interview will focus on the sexual and reproductive aspects of alien abduction and contact experiences. Questions include themes of pregnancy and/or infant loss, sexual violence, and sexual interactions. There are resources available to participants in the case of emotional distress and a coping plan available as well. Participants are able to withdraw at any time. Interviews will take approximately 45-90 minutes and will be held electronically or in-person. This study has been reviewed by the University of Regina’s Research Ethics Board. Feel free to share this information with others who may be interested!

If interested, please follow the URL to the on-line survey: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/alienabductioncontact](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/alienabductioncontact?fbclid=IwAR0hm4NZzpqqjecFFPvuReQxED0Tx3tAuQxpAKrZmpR76gyVKJC6I29-EN4)

33,Sorry if this doesn't make sense to you guys....,Abductions,4,"So just watching fishermen out in sea made me think.... A fish being caught from its waters and then brought upon a ship/platform then being released into the sea amongst the other millions of fish. That fish might want to tell its survival story to other fish. The fish in the receiving end are probably going to. Be skeptical or non believers as there are so many fish who are lucky enough not to have even gone through that kind of experience. The ocean is so large the story may even of been the first time they have heard something as crazy. But it was true.
Now say these fish were actually humans, we could probably understand why most are non believers.... The planet we live on is huge! Is the principles the same in the fish story as a human abduction?"

35,I may have been abducted. Missing time experiences.,Abductions,10,"I have had 3 experiences of missing time and the third has me convinced that it, and possibly all three were abductions. 


1st. Not so much missing time as amnesia but still i cant help but feel like this experience is connected to the other two. 


My earliest memory is on my fifth birthday, I remember waking up in a strange state of having no specific memories, I remembered who I was, who my family were, the things I liked (starwars, dinosaurs, and the lion king, all of which are still awesome.) But I had no specific memories of events. It was as if my life started on that day with some general knowledge loaded into me. 


2nd. I'm around 20 years old. I'm living with my parents at the time and my room is in the basement. I have a digital clock in my room. 

I wake up to a sound that i can best describe as 3 notes being played on an electric guitar. Pleasant sounding and probably 3 notes of a major chord of some kind. I have my electric guitar hooked up to my amp upstairs and as this wakes me up I remember looking at the clock in my room and thinking ""who the fuck is playing mt guitar at 1:15am"" so i get out of bed and go upstairs to find no one. I spend 10 min checking the house and find nothing so i go back to bed only when i get back to my room the clock reads 5:57. From 1:15am to 5:57am it seemed that only 10 min had passed to me. Very strange but after a few months I mostly forget about and chalk it up to my tired mind playing tricks on me, untill... 


3rd time. I'm 25. I live alone in a cabin in the woods working for a retreat center. The house is down a dirt road that's maybe 1 and half miles long into the woods. My only neighbor within a couple sq miles lives just 300 ft or so from my house. 


One night im visiting my parents and leave around 9pm. My house is about an hour from theirs so expect get home around 10. I drive home, walk inside, do the usual routine of using the bathroom changing into pjs and then turn on my xbox to watch tv or play a game before bed. Only when i do the clock reads 1:17am. I double check with my phone and house clock. I should have gotten home around 10 but somehow its 1:17. After an hour or so of freaking out i go to bed. 


The next morning my neighbor calls me to ask if I saw ""strange orange lights last night around 10"" they were ""over your (my) house"" and ""looked almost like a sunrise."" 



The last experience combined with y neighbors account of lights has me thinking that i may have been abducted sometime between leaving my car and entering my home that night. Can anyone help me figure out what happened that night? It was 2 years ago now and thinking about it since then i cant help but feel the 2 earlier experiences are connected somehow."
36,Unexplained Time Missing,Abductions,3,"Hi there. I wanted to finally share my story in hopes that someone has had something similar happen or can help me figure out what happened to my mom and me a few years ago. I don't have a UFO story. I never saw an orb or light, but what happened felt equally as odd and terrifying at the time. Reading over my story I know it may not add up to someone who is not from Oklahoma and can sound like we just forgot that we drove through an area, but that's not the case.   
In September 2017 my mom and I both took off a day of work to drive to Ardmore Oklahoma from OKC so that I could file paperwork with the County to officiate my brother's wedding later that month. We were going to make it a girl's day and go to the casino and like always when we drive south (usually to Texas not to small Oklahoma towns), we stop in Davis Oklahoma to visit the chocolate factory. All of our stops were a quick jump off of Interstate-35. We planned on getting chocolate first, then file paperwork, then head south to the casino. We took I-35 and never made it to Davis Oklahoma. We never passed through the beautiful Arbuckle Mountains and we most definitely didn't pass by the field of windmills that are always so noteworthy. We assumed we got our towns out of order as we arrived in Ardmore and took care of business. When we left Ardmore we headed south and made it to the casino. But we were shocked when we got there because we expected to hit Davis first. What happened to the scenic Arbuckle Mountains and the big wind turbine farm? You can't argue with logic. We must have been mistaken. The Casino must not have been as far South as we thought. We kept driving knowing in our guts we didn't pass Davis or the mountains but also knowing we were about to enter Texas. We got off the highway and turned around. We passed the Casino again, drove past Ardmore, and eventually drove through the long stretch of Arbuckle Mountains, the fields of windmills and Davis Oklahoma. We never stopped for chocolate. We were so freaked out because we knew we didn't drive through this going South but we HAD to have passed it to make it to Ardmore. It's not something you can just miss in the blink of an eye. There were at least 30 minutes that we can't account for. We drove by landmarks that we knew and would have remembered. We felt the shock of driving through this stretch and commenting on how beautiful it was compared to the city and the rest of the dry and flat state. You always get this feeling when you drive through. It feels like you're in Arkansas, not Oklahoma. So when we finally drove through, supposedly for the second time, it was a shock. We were never so lost in conversation that we would have missed the part of the state we looked forward to seeing as we escaped the city. We laughed eventually and promised not to tell anyone because we would sound crazy but we both knew something happened that could not be explained."
37,Anxiety or real abduction?,Abductions,6,"Several times a week, I’ll wake up 2 hours after dozing off. In pure panic. Disoriented. Skin feels hot to the touch. Feeling extremely fearful like something is wrong. One particular night, I had this happen , and I walked to the kitchen and felt like I was being watched. Almost like moving through a crowd. I could feel the energy and presence of people around me. But nobody was there.

A couple nights ago I woke up suddenly, like I was in danger. And it usually takes me a while to fall back to sleep. But then I’m fine. 

I have seen a UFO in the past when I was much much younger.
And sometimes I’ll wake up feeling extremely groggy like I’ve been drugged. It’s always unsettling for me. And it’s almost impossible for me to wake up. I’ve not had any sleep paralysis, either. 

Thoughts?"

39,Missing time?,Abductions,4,"I'm working on research for a future podcast episode and I'm trying to compile people's experiences with missing time. If anyone has an experience they would like to share, please let me know."
40,From The Super Natural by Whitley Strieber and Jeffrey J. Kripal,Abductions,1,"“As Jacques Vallée has taught us in his own books, if a form of mind wanted to really influence, shape, or direct a culture, it would not bother with the culture’s public arguments or politics. It would choose to work on the culture’s deepest operating system. It would go to the place of dreams and vision. It would choose to work on the cultural imagination."""
41,“Missing 411” movie; what is it implying that took these kids?,Abductions,13,"The movie never says, but reading between the lines it seems like they’re saying something paranormal (aliens, bigfoot, other) is the reason. I wonder if you all know more about it."
42,Not sure what’s happened,Abductions,5,"I don’t know much about abductions because the more I look into it the more it creeps me out but I’ve definitely not been one to miss out on my own personal alien experiences and my own paranormal experiences so part of me believes that I could’ve been abducted.

A few weeks ago I woke up with a long cut to the left of my shin almost as if it was cut by a sharp object. This morning I woke up with the same exact cut just an inch to the right of the original cut. I have no idea how either of them have got there and what’s weird is that they’re the exact same length on the same position if my leg... anyways I thought I’d post this to see what you guys would say about it I don’t know if I’m being paranoid or if it’s an actual abduction"
43,Usually known as the HatMan but I believe there's more to it,Abductions,12,"When I was four years old I was laying in bed, and I saw light coming through the window above my bed (window was facing back yard) and I thought it was weird that there was a street light in my backyard. I stood up on my bed and looked out the window and there it was, he must have been 7 feet tall, wearing a trenchcoat and a big brimmed hat. I couldn't see any details because he was pure black and the light coming from up above behind him made it harder to see. Even though I couldn't see his face I could feel him staring at me and communicating with me in my mind. I don't know what was being said but I had this feeling where my adrenaline was being suppressed and I was so calm but I didn't want to be. My dog that always slept in the bed with me ran and hid under the bed, from that night forward my dog would only sleep under the bed.  When I was finally able to I broke out of whatever was happening and ran to my Mom in the living room. I told her what was happening and she went to bed with me.

The next morning my older brother called my Mom, we were living in Texas and my brother (23/24 years old at the time) was living in Minnesota. He asked if everyone was okay. I had almost never talked to or seen my brother at that point and didn't really know him. He told us that last night he was taken from his place and he was in a room that looked like it was completely stainless steel and there were no lights but the walls were emitting light. He said there was a metal bench and my mom and sister (about 19 years old and lived up the street from me at the time) was there and crying hysterically. The HatMan was in the room and another being was doing something to my Mom and she was in pain. My brother stood up and the HatMan grabbed him by the throat and lifted him off the ground. My brother then proceeded to stick his thumb in the HatMans eye (he described the eye as big and and black, kind of insectoid but it seemed more like it was some sort of a contact) and then two other beings came in the room and had a metallic pipe in their hands. The HatMan put my brother down and the other beings put one of the metal pipes to his side and shocked him and he lost consciousness. He later woke up in his duplex. 

Later that day my brother stopped by my Grandma's apartment and she was pissed at my uncle that was living with her at the time because he ""came home drunk and broke her coffee table."" He told her that he was laying on the couch and saw the HatMan standing at the end of the couch, my uncle then got up and went to attack it and the HatMan grabbed him by the throat, lifted him up and dropped him on the coffee table and disappeared. My uncle had bruises all the way around his neck and it looked like Andre the Giant choked him out. 

This was the most terrifying moment of my life and as I write this I feel sick to my stomach and like I am crawling out of my skin. Though he is called the HatMan by many, I've always referred to him as Nightmare because that's how I feel about him."
44,Anyone remember seeing something oddly specific before being 'abducted'?,Abductions,15,"I don't believe any of you nor my friend, but he told me about when he thought he was abducted, and he saw something right before which he remembered clearly. Wasnt anything totally unusual but it was specific enough for him to remember clearly. Wondering if any of you saw something too, what was it? I'll reveal what it was in my friend's story later but I want to see if anyone else's description matches first."
45,I think I was abducted when I was a baby,Abductions,7,"I haven't really thought about this since about a week ago.

I learned to talk, walk, read and stuff like that at a much younger age than normal. I've always been obsessed with UFO's and my mom said I started talking about ""Lights in the sky"" when I was two years old. I also have a fear of grey aliens? 

What do you guys think?"
46,Visited/abducted in my room with ex gf right next to me,Abductions,29,"So this is kind of fucked to talk about as it still makes me feel very on edge.

A few years ago, I was in bed with my ex whom lived with me. We were getting ready to go to bed, and doing the normal whatever-the-fuck people do; I.e, read, talk, think, etc. It got to the point that I was tired enough to turn the bedroom light off(I always have another light on in a room that can shine into the bedroom, and leave the door cracked)

So, I must have fallen asleep around 2am or so. I wake suddenly with the most unsettling feeling I've ever had, and immediately my entire attention is glued to the door, from what feels like an outside force or extreme intuition of knowing something is happening. My body begins to shake, and I can feel my heart dropping into my body, ala what I assume people feel in situations of grave danger/complete fearful uncertainty. I have this innate feeling that something is coming to the door. I just know with my entirety that it's happening. 

The longer it goes on, the more this horrendous feeling grows. I see the door starting to open slowly, and that's when the absolute paralyzing feeling engrossed me. I see what I can only describe as the most terrifyingly obscene ""creature"" or ""thing"" walking into the room towards me. It was very large, with bulbous arms, and head that's directly connected to the torso, no neck, a very wide chest, and gangly legs that are still decently thick. The mere sight of this sends my brain into unfathomable panic, as I can't even register what the fuck it is. I've never seen anything in any movie, show, cartoon, drawing, etc, that is anywhere close to what this was. My brain still has a very vague idea of what it looked like, because it was outside my realm of perception for my brain to fill in the blanks that my vision doesn't hold. 

It walks towards me, and without speaking, fills my head with the most disgusting, painful fear I can imagine. I remember looking over to my then gf and seeing she's completely asleep. I try and nudge her, which is already very hard due to paralysing panic, but nothing works. It eventually gets right up to me and outstretched it's arms and grabbed me. Then, everything was black, a sheer conscious memory of nothing but complete void in memory, sight, feeling, what have you.

I come back to around 4/5am, drenched in sweat with the exact same fear I was experiencing, but now back in bed. I had pain all over and felt as if I had been drugged, that delirious type foggy feeling, with the pain of memory loss, knowing that time and events aspired and I have no recollection. At that moment she wakes up and asks what's wrong, and I don't say anything then because I'm in disbelief and just genuinely afraid to even say it out loud, as I wanted to pretend it was all fake.

I've talked about it maybe a few times, but it's incredibly disheartening to speak out loud, and to think about. I still get that same feeling sometimes at night, and it really fucks me up. But nothing sense then has happened to that degree. I am 100% sure it wasn't a dream. There were signs of a disturbance and shit that didn't add up from when we laid down, there were marks on my body and blood on my side of the bed. Not a lot, but enough to notice without examining thoroughly.

Sorry this is so long, it's hard to articulate because I've never typed it out. If anyone has had a similar experience and wants to share, please do. I've read a lot of different experiences and none explain anything to what I saw and what I presumably was taken by for a few hours. I'm not gonna tldr this because I don't know how to compress it. I've thought about regression hypnosis or something to try and remember, but honestly I don't think I want to relive that

Edit: I say ""must have fallen asleep around 2am"" because that's when I generally fell asleep then, and I remember looking at my phone's clock and it saying 1:55am before I set it on my nightstand"
47,possible abduction? a dream within a dream,Abductions,2,"last night i had a dream that bothered me so much, i made an account just to document it and see what people think. i've believed in and associated myself with extraterrestrials since I was a child, to a pretty obsessive degree, and although I experience near-constant synchronicities and ""glitches"", i never felt like i've experienced abduction until recently.It started about a week ago, when shortly after waking up i noticed two tiny dots tattooed symmetrically on one of the knuckles of my left hand (will try to include a photo below). i'm an observant person and i stare at my hands constantly, so I was completely shocked, where did they come from? I have a lot of tattoos but I did none around this area of my hand. I felt incredibly uneasy about it. I also woke up in tremendous pain, especially in the back of my neck. I joked with my wife, oh my god i've been abducted. I wish I could remember what I dreamt about that night. Since that day I've felt incredibly weak, like my physical energy has been drained. I've also been having vivid dreams all week, a lot of them involving my deceased loved ones.

Last night, I had a dream I was in my childhood home, except there was a large body of water next to it. I looked out the window and saw a massive, disc shaped UFO hovering above the house across the street. A huge beam of light was descending from it. I called my roommate to the window, asking her if she saw it too, and she said yes, this is real. The aircraft seemed to realize we could see it,because it shrunk down to a much smaller size and started flying into our window, like it was trying to get into the house. I was so scared that I jumped into bed and hid under the covers. after that, I remember small glimpses of greys, I would open my eyes and it was obvious to me that I was laying on an operating table, they was a few of them, typical greys, staring down at me with their big eyes. but it was so hazy, like i was under anesthesia, and as soon as they noticed I was waking they'd make sure to put me back under. then i ""woke up"" (still dreaming) in the same bed I was hiding in, and for the rest of the dream I was hysterically telling everyone i'd see, I've been abducted i've been abducted! It was so vivid, I can see the imagery of it all crystal clear in my mind.When I woke up for real, I had the worst headache of my life. I get headaches fairly often but I've never just woken up with a headache like that, it usually comes from staring at the screen too long or something. The dream was fresh in my mind and I lay there in agony, thinking oh my god, I've been abducted and the radiation gave me this headache. The pain was severe. eventually I worked up the strength to get out of bed and take 4 ibuprofen, then eventually fell back asleep... woke up again a few hours later, still thinking about my previous dream. when I got out of bed, I noticed two spots just under my left knee where my skin had been scraped off (will also try to include a photo of this). Like I said, I've had no energy all week, so I've barely even gotten out of bed, I have no idea how I would've skinned my knee, and in two symmetrical circular shapes? and I know for a fact these were not there yesterday, it is very obviously a fresh wound...apart from that, I feel even more drained today, like I can hardly even stand up. my whole body aches and I almost fainted in the shower. don't really know what's the point of me posting this here, a friend suggested I do so. also, I don't know if this makes any difference, but i've been staying in new mexico the past few months. I have a wife who was asleep next to me the entire time I was having this dream.

I also had an extremely vivid dream a few months ago where I was standing next to a large body of water with a dock leading into it. under the dock I saw the large eyes of animals that appeared to be bears, wolves and cougars, all staring at me. then a large cat-like animal came out from under the dock and transformed into a tall nordic-looking woman. we had a long conversation but I can't remember anything she said to me. When I woke up, I knew it had been some kind of visitation, but I'm not sure what it meant. It felt like she was trying to awaken something within me. The next day, I had two unnerving encounters with strangers that I intuitively feel were reptilians. One of them literally hissed at me. It was the strangest thing. new mexico creeps me the hell out but I love it here.

for more context, I am a very spiritual person and always have been, i've been obsessed with the stars and specifically astrology since I first learned to read. I believe in god, jesus, atlantis, the illuminati, 5D ascension, guardian angels, past lives, heaven, hell, you name it, I probably believe in it and have studied it. I am almost 27 years old. I would love to hear some feedback on this dream and if anyone's had similar experience. Also going to try and post the pictures in the comments. Thanks for reading :)

edit: posted the links to the images in the comments. sorry i have no idea how reddit works lol."
48,Has anyone ever compiled the medical/miscarriage records of abductee women?,Abductions,5,"It seems the the best physical evidence (for modern science) of the physical reality of abductions would be a collection of medical records from the many women who have claimed to have had their fetuses removed a few months into pregnancy. 

Does anyone know of any efforts to compile data on this? 

Thanks for your help!"
49,"Ive found these grid-like red marks on my back in 2 different states across the country and at least 5 different times over the last 3 years. No pain, no other place, always my back. Wtf?",Abductions,35,0
50,Why hasn’t there been any solid high-quality video evidence of aliens?,Abductions,8,"“I had the impression that this object could foresee what I was thinking. This is an experience that has changed me for the rest of my life,” says Captain Jorge Polanco, one of the witnesses in the 1955 Bariloche Incident [(see Supplementary Video)](https://youtu.be/bizD8EBvTNg?t=226).

If UFOs already possess the technology to dwarf the jets of the U.S. Navy, they most likely have the data on recent man-made technologies like the internet and smartphones. Now, with smartphones, internet, and surveillance cameras everywhere, even one very clear video of an alien encounter and UFO landing would equate to official contact. To put it simply, we lack close-up footage of UFOs because that is not what they want us to see. 

Thus, assuming that these aliens may be choosing not to contact us for now, one might wonder why they chose to appear before [some](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-wales-south-west-wales-38835991/broad-haven-pupil-s-ufo-sightings-marked-40-years-on) [children](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/22/AR2007032202132.html) in rural areas in the past. A logical guess as to why these aliens might have appeared to children but not to professionals with credentials might have to do with Earth’s own internal level of development. Specifically, if such alien encounters were to happen to a notable person, it would disrupt the person’s original “intended” course of life. Specifically, they might have become **ufologists** instead of achieving feats in their relevant field as an aftermath of a life-changing experience. All things considered, if aliens are making any contact with us, they want to minimize their impact on humanity while gradually helping us realize that we are not alone. 

Nevertheless, in recent years, UFOs appeared in front of U.S. Navy pilots to the point where the Navy and Pentagon were officially forced to acknowledge their existence. The United States had effectively denied the existence of UFOs until now. Its sudden change in stance has rendered government agencies questionable and suspicious in the eyes of the general public. To me, it seems these UFOs are aware of humanity’s censorship of alien life, and they are not “comfortable” with the [**elites**](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/10/jeffrey-epstein-trump-clinton-friends) or [**media corporations**](https://www.quora.com/Why-would-I-think-Pizzagate-is-real) currently [**governing**](https://youtu.be/aEvpZ8SM9L4?t=459) [**mankind**](https://youtu.be/SiX71WIpsK0?t=29)."
51,Something happened while camping.,Abductions,12,"It’s been almost 10 years since this happened, but I still can’t really understand it and honestly it makes me uncomfortable to recount the story. I was telling someone this story over the weekend and they suggested I try to find if anyone else had a similar experience. So, here I am. 

I went camping in a pretty remote location in the foothills of Tennessee, USA, and the first night we (my gf at the time but now my wife and I) arrived at the campsite it was late at night and already dark. There were 4-5 other couples there already and they had set up our tent for us. This was my first time visiting the campsite. We sat around the campfire for 15-20 minutes talking with the host and then went to bed because it was pretty late. That night “something” happened. 

I had an experience that I can best describe as a dream. In this experience I “woke up” in the middle of a clearing in the woods with my wife. We were both drowsy, and she was more or less incapacitated as if she was sedated. I was drowsy but also in a full panic of fear feeling as if we were being chased or “trying to escape” or something like that. I grabbed her under the arm and was sort of dragging/walking across this clearing towards a group of tents. The sky was sort of foggy and gray so I had a little bit of visibility, and I could make out some very clear features about the area; a pond, a cleared area with trees all around, a basketball hoop attached to a tree, groups of tents, etc. I was able to drag her back to the tent and lay down.

Thats’s when I actually woke up. Terrified. Our tent did not have a rain fly so I could see out the top of the tent into the trees and sky. I saw a circular object with six circular lights in a circular pattern hovering just over the trees. The craft made no noise at all. I laid there completely paralyzed, and after a few moments the craft sort of just flew off and out of sight. I laid in the tent completely scared for a long time, trying to make sense of what I was thinking and feeing. I was able to finally go back to sleep.

The next morning we woke up and I saw the campsite for the first time. It was exactly like I had seen in my experience... even down to the detail of the basketball hoop nailed to a tree. Again, I had some very strong and strange feelings after recognizing those surroundings from my “dream”. 

We didn’t stay the next night, and I told my gf the story on the drive home the next day. Fortunately she didn’t/doesn’t think I am crazy. I still can remember that event as vividly as if it happened yesterday. 

I am curious if there are others with a similar experience."
52,Question about abductions.,Abductions,15,"I have never been or hope to be abducted.

I do belive alot of storys when i lurk on this sub and appreciate the telling of your experiences.

But 1 question i always wanted to know but never seen a answer to.

Any of you who have been abducted, do you have any dogs? Weather it be guard dogs or just pets. If so do they react? Are they sleeping in the room or outside during the encounter? What do they do ect?

 If not dogs any other animal that would cause a scean if anything were to enter the area."
53,Need help/insights anything you may have experienced or witnessed before.,Abductions,19,"Where to even start...

This happened about a week ago.
So let me paint the picture for you all I am in bed like any other regular night trying to calm my mind after a day at work and get some rest before I go to work in the morning again. I wake up tossing and turning around 2ish when I hear some strange noises outside and I think nothing of it but have the urge to use the bathroom so I go and do my business and return to my bedroom to still hear these noises. My best description of the sound would be that of a drone that kids would play with but with a sort of neon noise to it. It reminded me of something off of Tron the movie and the noises the vehicles made mixed with a toy drone. I have never heard anything quite like that before so I take a look out my window and come to the realization that this noise if coming directly above my apartment building and I see a slight glow of yellow light coming from above I can not see anything and decide to go downstairs and look from my patio. Upon coming outside the noise drastically got more faint as the yellowish light brightened and turned into more of a white/led light before making an unbearably loud static like noise mixed with that of an EMP noise from a movie or something. This made my eardrums feel as if they were on fire and the pain brought me to my knees and the light continued to brighten an then enclosed around me. As if a super massive flashlight was being shined on me and then the blast of noise hit me once again but louder and I blacked out or fainted or passed out. I did not see any craft or anything above me except for the faint yellow glow which then turned in a spotlight that focused on me after I was brought to my knees. It felt like a weapon being targeted at me more than anything else and those were the thoughts that had gone through my head before I blacked out.

Now the unexplainable.

Upon waking up I was slightly disoriented and found myself in a room and the walls were like a cream white and it was very bright but there was no source from which the light was coming. It was as if the walls themselves were the light source and they were lit up from within. At this point I am started to get anxious and very nervous as well as scared. The next thing I know a rectangle in the wall makes a compression noise like it is releasing pressure and begins to open up. This is no regular door as it opened downward like an upside down garage and the “alien” “specimen” I’m not sure what came through the door after opening but it was around 4 1/2 feet tall? No body hair and no hair at all on it but a larger then normal head accompanied by two eyes that reminded me of a praying mantis’s eyes and a small mouth with teeth like a whales it looked like straw teeth as it slightly grinned as it entered the room. This thing scared the hell out of me and was like nothing I have ever seen. It had a piece of glass in its hand which I assumed to be an information tablet/monitor. I stood there in disbelief and felt a paralyzed feeling go throughout my body I couldn’t move if I wanted and my thoughts were racing beyond measure. My breathing increased and I felt as if I was having an anxiety attack that is when I realized how “pure” the air was. 

(Side note my gf works at a hospital as a respiratory therapist.)

This air felt like it was 100% oxygen which I have taken before through a mask at a hospital. I notice my limbs start to tingle and I focus on my breathing and begin to relax. The alien figure then looks at me from head to toe and nods and  waves it hand but not like a hello toward me but more of a begin. It took me a second but I realized that it had only 3 fingers and a thumb and I noticed three dots on its palm that were a significantly darker shade of grey compared to the rest of its lighter grey skin tone. 

This is where things begin to get odd. The colors of the walls start to fade into different shades of red, blue, purple, orange, green, then to black and white continuously. They started to fade slowly then sped up as the “cycle” completed. The thing is overtime the colors changed so did my emotions and I couldn’t help but look straight into the eyes of the thing in front of me. I felt unbearable hate toward this thing during one cycle in which I wanted to murder and mutilate it in the most gruesome and horrible way I could think of. On another cycle I felt so happy and filled with joy as if I was on a drug of some sort and I wanted to approach the thing in front of me and dance and hold its hand. I felt almost as if I was on drugs during some cycles. I was just standing there unable to move and unable to look away from this thing in front of me for what felt like hours. On one cycle I felt a deep pain from within as if I had lost a loved one and I was in extreme phycological pain. The worst I could ever experience as if all my loved ones were gone from the world. My mind was getting physically tired from experiencing all of these emotions and stress that I began to feel unable to stay awake. After another cycle had gone through and the colors faded from one to another it stayed on white and got so extremely bright that I couldn’t see anything at all and I was being blinded. Like staring into the sun except it was a bright white light like an led. It began to fade and get less bright when I noticed the thing in front of me was now gone. After a short period the light began to fade ever so slowly until it was the darkest I’ve ever experienced. It reminded me of a dark room in highschool that the art teachers would use for photos except it was darker. It was like being in a black hole it was the darkest thing I’d ever experienced. That is when I fainted or blacked out again and I awoke to find my self inside my apartment again with the patio door closed and me facing away from it. I didn’t know what to think and returned to bed. I thought of many different explanations and nothing made sense and I couldn’t help but think of what happened before passing out from exhaustion only to wake up the next morning and feel very disoriented and ended up calling of work as I need the day to try and make sense of what I had just experienced.

I don’t even know how to explain this and I feel and sound like I am a crazy person and writing this out feels so odd. To put this whole thing into words and post is unusual. I have read and looked throughout this sub and a couple others and can’t seem to find anyone else with similar experiences as mine. I feel like they tested my emotional capabilities with the lights and in that room I’ve never felt anything like that. It is indescribable and I just need assurance I’m
Not going completely insane. I’ve gone to the doctor recently and they prescribed me anxiety meds that I still need to pick up but otherwise checked out fine on everything else. 

Can anyone help explain this or have anything similar happen to you or anyone you know anything can help me make this make sense in my head.

Thank you and stay safe folks."

since i was little i have had sleep paralysis and seen tall dark figure in the room, i would wale up with a weird circular indentions only on the right side of my chest (almost look like needle marks or scoops or something).

57,Possible abduction involving timeline manipulation,Abductions,5,"The only things I remember are having been in bed at night as a little kid and seeing from my bedroom window our nextdoor neighbor's house on fire with a spaceship having crashed into it, tubes with liquid going through them which I believed was being injected into me and was a bad thing, and observing from a seamless first, second, and third person perspective my spirit descending ""back"" into my body. The neighbor's house was unaffected when I checked afterward, so if it wasn't a dream, which it didn't feel like it was, then either time was reversed, or the ""aliens"" took me out of that timeline and placed me in this one."
58,I’m probably crazy,Abductions,16,"Ok I am probably just crazy. I need to start back when I was a kid, I used to love anything scary including aliens. It never bothered me. I am not sure when but at some point I got a very irrational fear of aliens. Some may even call it a phobia, this carried to adulthood. I watched the 4th kind at one point and couldn't sleep for days. I was so afraid all the time. I couldn't even look up at the sky I would go into a panic attack. Then one day last year I awoke with a memory. I can say dream because dreams move and you do stuff in them. In this memory it was almost like looking at a picture. I could see a little ways in front of me we will say 4 yards or so. Was an extremely tall being, I only knew it was y'all bc it was siting in an all metal chair and I was standing below it and I still looked up at it. With this memory was such a strong feeling, like trust or happiness. I couldn't see anyone or anything else there but I could feel the presence of others nearby. But now my fear is gone, completely gone. That's the most astonishing thing to me. After a little googling what I saw mostly looks like insectoid alien."

61,Possible abduction (Missing time) and other experiences.,Abductions,10,"Throughout my life i've had some really weird experiences. I'll share some of my experiences. 

I woke up, I was fully awake. No paralysis. I sat up and to my left looking over me was a black shadow figure. Humanoid looking, but just jet black. I stood up to it and asked, "" what are you?"" It was then after that question that I froze up and became terrified. Like an animal caught in headlights. A too scared to move sensation. I blacked out. I woke up standing in the corner of my room. About 5 hours had past by. I don't remember a thing. It was just blank. 

I also want to share another recent experience. This was about a year or so ago. I woke up to this ""black cloud"" that was sprawled out like a blanket over me and my girlfriend. It was jet black and looked like a weird liquid/gas material. My initial reaction was to try and point at it. The part i tried pointing at moved back, avoiding being touched. It then started rolling together and moving in a gaseous/liquid like fashion towards the cieling. It moved like it was alve. Midway to the cieling i woke my girlfriend up and she watched if with me. It sprawled out over the cieling and just vanished.  I made sure my girlfriend gave me all the details of what i saw before i told her anything and it was all right on. This experience was important to me because i now know there is infact alien life. What its doing, where its from, i dont know. 

I reached out to another redditer that had the same experience as me. He even went on to say fhat he tried punching it, and it moved back, like when i tried to point at it. He lives in the same city as I do. 

I have other experiences with orbs of light in very close proximity. My gilfriend has seen the red orange orb of light i saw as a kid. My girlfriend has never had an experience before she met me. My father and his wife and my grandparents have seen the red orbs. 

As a kid i also had a ""poltergeist"" experience. I was in a room watching ed edd and eddy. The tv turned off, light switched flipped down, and door slammed shut. Pitch black in the room. I went to the door to try and open it and it was if someone was holding the door handle, not letting me open it. After about 20 seconds i was able to get out.

I just wanted to vent some of my experiences. I feel like i am being watched throughout my life like some experiment. 

I feel alienated from others because of these experiences. Some people say i'm crazy, and the religious say that these are demons. I believe i have ptsd from all these experiences but i feel like i have healed I think... i do have severe anxiety issues. But its like i dont even care anymore. I can sleep without the door barricaded open. My girlfriend on the other hand, cannot sleep without the light on, without youtube playing, or the cat or someone with her. She was never like this before.

Its my personal belief that these are intelligent beings. What they want i have no clue.

Just wanted to vent."

63,Was this a dream?,Abductions,1,"Hey guys, I already posted this on another subreddit, because I didn't know this one, so if you could help me out with this dream, I'd really appreciate it. I had it a couple of years ago, and till today nobody believes me. First of all, I'm sorry about my English, it isn't my first language.

So, in this dream, I ""woke up"" laying on a reclinable kind of chair, to see a super luminous white kind of room, all the walls where white, and so was the furniture (there were like drawers chests and stuff like that). And then, I saw a woman (I felt she was a woman, but I couldn't really tell, it was just a white/greyish body not so glowy like the room, and very tall), she turned back, looked at me and smiled (again, I felt like she smiled at me, but she didn't have an actual face, just the head, slimmer than our kind of head, but no eyes or mouth or anything). Then she ""greeted me"", and then she approached to me and ""said"" ""don't worry, it'll be quick"" or something like that; I put everything between quotation marks because you couldn't see her talking, because like I said, there wasn't a mouth, but I could hear her in my head, I don't know, it was really weird, but I felt really safe there, and comfortable.
Next thing I know, I felt like a pinch on the ¿back? of my elbow (the place where you get your blood drawn), and I saw how a test tube, right next to the chair I was in, was instantly filled with my blood. The woman ""thanked me"", everything went black, and I woke up (for real this time) on my bed. I looked at where I had felt the pinch, and I had a really little red dot. I should have had taken a picture of it, but my phone back then couldn't really catch it. 

And that's it, I googled it a million times but I never found anything. I use to have dreams, but I don't usually remember them after a certain time. 

Could I have been abducted? What do you think?

66,"I had a dream, maybe not. I'm not sure",Abductions,2,"Had a dream last night, maybe it wasn't. I was standing on the driveway of my house (I was actually standing in the same spot yesterday afternoon) and I saw what looked like a transparent round object coming down from the sky.

As it got closer to the ground, it wasn't transparent anymore, it was changing color (kind of the image you see on the old TVs while changing the channel) when it actually landed I realized this was a UFO - The typical disk like with the dome on the top, it was metal gray color. I remember thinking ""what is that?"" And when it landed I kind of thought ""its happening, its the aliens"" 

For some reason I immediately look to my left and there was a short gray alien, big head and big eyes. Next thing I remember is laying in some type of bed or chair, kind of leaning back. I felt like gravity was holding me to the bed/chair and I couldn't move (kind of when a plane is taking off and you feel stuck to your chair) 

At this moment my though was ""they are taking me"". I then felt my legs opening up apart while I was laying down and I thought the gravity force was doing this but I immediately realized someone was opening up my legs to look at my crotch/anus area. At this point I anticipated pain so I screamed so hard but no sound came out. At this point I woke up on my bed.

I want to point out I never felt pain. I am not sure if this was a dream or not. It felt so real"

69,My Experiences,Abductions,11,"As a child I was terrified of aliens. Movies, television, any form of media depicting extraterrestrials , specifically greys, was extremely disturbing to me. Despite my fears, I cannot recall an outright abduction experience. I do, however, remember three odd occurrences in childhood that have stuck with me. 

The first occurrence happened when I was about five years old. It was the afternoon and I was napping on my parents bedroom. My parents bedroom was a fairly large room and was arranged in a way in which the bed was on the wall opposite of the door leading into the hallway. I recall waking up lying in the corner on my side against the wall near the door. My head was situated in an awkward angle against the wall. I remember awakening and feeling confused and frightened. I fumbled with the doorknob and went to be with my parents. I don’t recall if I told them. The bed was too far away from the wall for me to have fallen out of bed. I could have been sleepwalking but I do not have a history of this but I suppose it’s possible. Seems benign as I type it but I’ve always remembered this with unease.

The second occurrence I remember occurred at roughly the same age. It was nighttime and I was once again in my parents bed. My grandpa has come from out of town to visit us and was with my parents in the living room. I remember wanting to stay up as I was excited that my grandpa was in town. I was restlessly lying in bed unable to sleep when I saw something that frightened me. My parent’s room was attached to the master bathroom. As I was scared to sleep in the dark my parents had left the bathroom light on for me. The bathroom door was closed but the was enough of a gap between the floor and the door to provide enough of a night light. I saw what I perceived to be two shadows/figures obscuring the light. I perceived these figures as being inside of the bathroom, pacing back and forth. I don’t recall getting my parents and assume I either feel asleep.

The third childhood occurrence was in the form of a dream. My other grandparents live on a ranch. In my dream I was outside with my grandfather, holding his hand. My grandfather was leading my to a large disk like craft that was on the ground in the pasture in front of the ranch house. We entered the craft and I recall sitting down on bench in dimly lit humid room. I didn’t see anyone or anything else-just my grandfather. During the “dream” my grandfather never spoke or acknowledged me aside from leading me to the craft. I remember feeling bizarre and confused-sort of off when I awoken.

As an adult, I have had a recurring bizarre experience. This occurrence approximately every few months and actually happened last week. The occurrence is as follows- I wake up early morning hours and feel a presence. Mentally I always think grey but I have never seen them in this scenario. I feel frighten and sometimes feel a ringing or buzzing in my ear that resonates into my mandible. As soon as it begins it’s over and I feel an intense itching on my forearms and shins. Usually I fall asleep after this and wake up in the morning without further incident. However last time, as I was itching, I distinctly heard a door in the house creak as if someone had moved it. Oddly my wife recalls hearing the noise as well.

I don’t know if I am dreaming or am misremembering. I hold a professional job and have a loving family. I have a great life but have always felt something else was going on with me. Almost like I’m supposed to know something that I can’t connect the dots. I was actually considering hypnosis but admittedly I need to research this more. I am mostly a lurker but after reading so many other accounts I felt compelled to share. What are your thoughts?"
70,Alien abduction or realistic dream?,Abductions,4,"First off let me make a note that I am a very light sleeper, any little noise can wake me up and I'm usually always very conscious of my surroundings even while sleeping. I don't fall into really deep sleeps. But I've had many sleep paralysis experiences but they've never involved aliens and my sleep paralysis lasts very long and happens multiple times during my episodes. But I haven't had sleep paralysis in about 2 years, so I don't think the experience I had last night was sleep paralysis at all, but it hardly seemed like a dream either. I've always believed we can't be alone and I've had many ufo sighting experiences, and I've always believed people could have been abducted by aliens. I've seen ufo's and used to have scary dreams of them too. But last night is the first time anything like this has ever happened to me and I wanna say it's a dream, I'm just not sure. So maybe you guys can give me an opinion. So my experience last night was this: I'm asleep, it's the middle of the night probably 1 or 2 am. I sleep with my bf and as said before I'm a light sleeper and usually wake up at random times and look around the room. Well I remember waking up at one point and I wasn't in our room anymore, and I could not move my head, seemed like only my head was immobilized and in my peripheral vision (and I can't believe I'm saying this, cause I believe but never wanted to see one for real) I see a grey figure standing behind me, so my head is like stuck like in a vice or something and I'm looking behind me at a grey figure looking back at me. I don't feel like I'm laying in bed, surface feels harder. And the thing that makes this so real, and makes me question it being a dream is the fact that I hear a drill right by my left ear, looking at this grey creature. The drill noise is super loud, deafening. I heard it guys. And it made me want to scream. It seemed like this only happened for a few minutes. And then when I jolted awake, I was back in my room in my bed with my bf. I am always aware of my bf's presence in bed. So for me to feel like I'm somewhere else with another being and a drill next to my ear and my head is locked in place, is very unsettling to me. I've had sleep paralysis enough to know this is different and can tell if something was just a bad dream. But this, this was just different and troubling. To top it off and make it even more scary and questionable to be a dream is the fact that I woke up with a severe headache, nauseous,  sore body (like post workout sore), light-headed,  feverish feeling and sweaty ( I hardly ever sweat, specially first thing in the morning).  I've felt off all day, headache and nausea eventually went away but been light -headed majority of the day. It's just not normal for me to have all those symptoms at once and overnight? After having a ""dream"" like that? Idk I REALLY want it to be a dream guys.. help me out. If it wasn't a dream, I really don't want it to happen again. If someone has truly think they've dealt with abduction, how can it prevented, or can it even be prevented? Doesn't seem like we have much control and if anyone even did believe, what could anyone do? That's what's scary about accepting truth about aliens existing and abductions happening,is that we have no control and are powerless over the situation. Which is why we all just say, ""it was a dream."" Right?"
71,"Here's my ""was this an abduction"" story.",Abductions,12,"So I've been sitting on this for years but now I'm getting curious. 

Basically, as a very young kid, I have had this reoccurring dream. I am on or near the beach where there is a huge structure set up in the sand- like it has all of these tubes and things, bright colors. As if you took the inside of a Chuck-E. Cheese and stuck it on a beach at night. I'm always near or inside the structure, scared, and running away from 3-4 figures that really match with what look like greys. They were always wearing silver clothes and stood maybe a foot or so taller than I was- so maybe 3.5-4 ft tall. Two are running from behind me and trying to get me to stop when one steps out in my path and I do stop. They don't feel mean but I don't want to be there and always feel scared, even though they seem to be trying to calm me down. Then I would wake up. I had that dream for years and as an adolescent, it stopped. 

As a kid, I was very into aliens and other strange stuff when I got older, and I used to be so, so scared of being out under the sky at night. We would go camping and I just remember for a period feeling so vulnerable when sitting exposed to the sky- like there was nowhere to run to and hide if anything were to show up. 

I went through normal teenage years but recently in the past 5 years since I've turned 18 shit has gotten a little weird. I keep waking up in the middle of the night panicking- full-on heart beating, terrified sweating, so scared that I don't move (although I can- it's not sleeping paralysis). There is an overwhelming feeling that something is nearby and coming to get me, that I can't see but it is close and every time this happens it feels familiar, like ""oh shit this again"". There's no pattern to when or where this happens- being in college sometimes it has been at y house, other times it's been in my dorm. It has not happened for the brief time I was overseas for a few months. It's awful but somehow shortly after I always end up falling asleep. Sometimes I try willing away whatever I feel is near. Once or twice I've heard weird sounds outside, like light metallic clanking, that I immediately associate as being connected to what's happening. I don't remember anything in particular the mornings after these panic events. They never happen the day and, although I'm an anxious person, I've never experienced symptoms like this with a clear cause. 

I live on a strange rural campus and have seen some weird stuff in the past few years. Two meteorites burning up and breaking apart, two rown mountain lights (I don't live on that particular mountain but close by and it looks to be the same phenomenon), and, most terrifyingly, a little white creature at night that looked for all the world like a ""crawler"", which I didn't know was a common phenomenon- and my friend was there to witness it with me. All these sightings were localized in one field- a field that I also felt very strangely drawn to the woods of one night and almost went into before breaking out into terror and sprinting back to my dorm, panicked the rest of the night. 

Anyway, I try to be very rational about these things but putting everything together it's a bit weird. I continue to have the panic events and sometimes will have pseudo-dreams where it feels like I'm looking at the environments and occupants of other planets, but these are always enjoyable and never feel threatening. They could also be due just to being imaginative so I don't give those much stock even though they can be very highly detailed and seem like things I wouldn't consciously think of the weirdest thing in my life that I don't tell people often is that I don't really connect with the idea of being human. I feel like I'm not meant to be human and should be some sort of shapeshifter or something which I know sounds bizarre. But I have no sexual attraction to anyone- never have- and generally think of my own species poorly, kind of as gross and undesirable which seems... I don't know. Not great or normal. I'd accept what has happened to me and move on but I don't like that the experiences continue with no explanation or deeper insight so I don't know what to do. I just want to remember what happens after one of those panic periods so I can know if I'm just being crazy or if there's something to be said for it. Does anyone else find any of this to be familiar?"

73,Just want to get this off my chest,Abductions,13,"Been trying to tell myself this was a dream but I'm not so convinced anymore. Happened around 2012.

I'd been reading up on UFOs. I heard that if you want to see a UFO, and I did, then you just start watching the skies and eventually they'll take notice. So one night I wake up after a nap, it's 11:30pm, and I remember I'd been planning to do some stargazing because it was a clear night. 

... I don't think I would have been able to read the clock well enough to tell the time in a dream.

I look out my window and see a few satellites go by, and head out to the backyard to take a look.

I almost immediately see two UFOs fly overhead and I'm thrilled. Then one of them doubles back and I start getting uneasy.  It lands in my backyard. Looks like some 1950s sci-fi rocket ship. I'm pressed up against the side of my house and about ready to run back inside, but I convince myself to walk towards it because hey this is really happening and this is what I'd been looking for.

Some  alien comes out of the ship and I walk towards it. Bright yellow skin, white hair. Communicates telepathically. Tries to convince me it's peaceful but I can see its thoughts too and it's a liar. And I call it a liar. And then I start feeling extremely tired and heavy and pass out in my yard. I can feel the dew on my face. My last thought is that it was gonna be embarrassing when someone found me there in the morning.

And then I'm in my bed. Somehow I know it's 1:30am. And I'm paralyzed.  Get a feeling that the alien's there in the corner watching me. Pass out again.

Wake up later in the morning, 430am, and bolt straight up in bed while saying ""what the fuck was that?!"".  Was extremely uncomfortable the rest of the day.

This is the only thing I remember but my family has a few stories going back almost 50 years. If this is an actual thing and not some sort of weird inherited delusion, then I have no idea wtf could be going on or why. It's unsettling."

78,"I have difficulty explaining my experience, feel like I need to share it to others",Abductions,5,"Hello all,

First I would like to say that I have been diagnosed as being bipolar 2 years ago, shortly after having strange dreams and hearing ""high frequency noises"". Even though I am diagnosed as mentally ill, I feel as if there are, from what I read, ""multidimensional beings"" involved and it is making me uncomfortable, mainly because I have no idea what is being done to my body and I suddenly started feeling anxiety.  I have never experienced it in my life until having these strange dreams/feeling like I'm being watched/etc - basically symptoms most experiencers exhibit. How ironic it is that we are made to look crazy and be called liars to the public, however I feel like there is a general reason for that. 

I have looked into people like Dolores Cannon and other individuals who have written books about the plan of extraterrestrials. Sadly, I feel as if no book will ever fully explain what these beings want with us, and I also feel as if we are being withheld information (and I think it's things we really don't want t know because imo the brain can only handle so much . I understand that we make ""contracts"" before coming here, but I am completely left in the dark, when I meditate I don't really receive any news on what is happening to my body. Since I mentioned it twice, I will list exactly what I have been going through body wise

I have been prescribed seroquel, and interestingly enough one of the symptoms that occur frequently with me are dry mouth. However, right before I go to sleep after taking it I suddenly feel as if there is something making it more difficult to breathe (?) kinda weird to suddenly happen literally right before sleeping. Not only that but if I close my eyes, I CAN see a little white ball sorta going away from my head, as if there is something being sucked away from me going somewhere I do not know. Also, I feel like there is something being done to my heart, when I close my eyes, I see an image/shadow of something that looks like a V, and the two sides (\\ and /) seem to move up and down in rhythm with my heartbeat. I woke up this morning feeling some pain in my heart, and it went away after a while. I also noticed that if I drink coffee (even decaf) I feel, well, gross. It's really difficult to explain.  


A couple of weeks ago I had a dream where I was laying in a bed and felt really sad and  people were watching me --- but I could not see them. I had the thought of ""don't stop drinking the coffee"" come in right before it ending, and then I woke up with an extremely dry mouth. Yes, I did drink coffee early on that day, but I find it odd that a dream would encourage me to drink coffee if that was what caused the dry mouth

I made this post because I wanted to get this off my chest, I need a community that can read and somehow understand the unknown without brushing me off to being ""mentally ill"". I do tell my therapist about extraterrestrials but I understand that they probably won't take this seriously. I also want to encourage others to speak their truth as well. It pains me to see that people are scared to express what they experience, mainly because they really cant' explain it in a way others will understand (people will always ask questions that you - the experiencer - cannot answer, this obviously dissuades people from even bothering with telling their story)

Another reason is because I want people to know that they are not alone. I know this is said often here, but oftentimes we face these things alone, surrounded by people who will never understand us, because eerily enough we are labeled as people who will probably ""make this up"" or ""we're crazy"" or ""if you don't know who is taking you or why, your post is fake"". Not true. Even though there are people who lie about this sadly (and I have no idea WHY anyone would lie about these things outside of money...) we need to support each other. I hope someone benefits off of knowing that you are not alone, and yes it can be very scary. Share your story folks because I feel like the more stories we have the more we can understand."

In vain the four innocents sought to vindicate themselves by saying that they were their own country-folk, *and had been carried away a short time since by miraculous men who had shown them unheard-of marvels, and had desired to give them an account of what they had seen.* The frenzied populace paid no heed to their defense, and were on the point of casting them into the fire, when the worthy Agobard, Bishop of Lyons, who having been a monk in that city had acquired considerable authority there, came running at the noise, and having heard the accusations of the people and the defense of the accused, gravely pronounced that both one and the other were false. That it was not true that these men had fallen from the sky, and that what they said they had seen there was impossible.

The people believed what their good father Agobard said rather than their own eyes, were pacified, set at liberty the four Ambassadors of the Sylphs, and received with wonder the book which Agobard wrote to confirm the judgement which he had pronounced.

87,Aliens? Probably Not,Abductions,6,"This occured on the morning of April 15th 2020 between 4:50am and 5:03am 

I have had strange dreams, spiritual experiences, and one previous sleep paralysis experience. But I have never had an encounter with an alien, until now. But probably not. Let me explain...

My boyfriend usually works early before the sun comes up, and when he does, he makes sure to give me a kiss and say goodbye, briefly waking me up in the morning. I usually fall back asleep immediately, and wake up later in the day. This morning started the same, he kissed me and went off to work to be there by 5am. I roll over and plan to go to sleep.

The next moments I didn’t feel like I was asleep, but only laying down with my eyes closed. I rolled onto my back, which I never do if I’m planning to try and sleep, and started to feel an urge to call for something. It spills out of my mouth smoothly before I even notice what I’m saying. “Aliens?” I call out aliens the same way someone would call out to god or the universe. I have never done something like this before, nor ever planned to. I would probably look like an idiot. 

All of a sudden my eyes are half open to see a gray flexible creature slowly crawl onto my bed. It was about the size of a small dog, but trust me it looked nothing like a canine. From what I could tell, it had 4 limbs like a lizard. Parallel to the ground, bending at sharp angles. And it had a very unnaturally long neck. I have tried to look up pictures of what it looked like, maybe someone's art, or storyboard idea, but I have found nothing similar to what I saw. And I can not draw for shit so I’m sorry there’s no illustration for this story. Just imagine a four limbed worm like creature with a structural spine. Dull black claws of four digits at the ends of all its arms. It’s connective tissue was similar to an undersea creature, doughy and squishy. But it wasn’t slimy at all. Its skin was smooth like a hairless cat, or a dolphin. And it was strong, I could see its muscles in its back and limbs. It obviously had climbing abilities, and could cause destruction if it needed to. If it had eyes, they must have been thin because I didn’t see any, and no prominent nose that I can remember. 

It climbed up from the bottom of my bed to the side of my right hip. It sat for a little bit on all fours making sure I knew it was there and that I was comfortable. It put one hand on my hip and the other on top of my belly. Then suddenly its neck extended towards my exposed stomach and began sucking with its round circular mouth under my left set of ribs. I didn’t feel like it was taking my organs, but it was definitely penetrating through my skin and past my muscles into my body. It had teeth, but they were not biting me, they were mainly there to steady and support its head and position it was taking to work. I held its neck with both of my hands like I was holding onto a delicate railing. It felt like someone was taking a vacuum tube to my stomach, but it was going through my body. 

Like I said previously, I've had a sleep paralysis experience before, that story is for another day. But this was different, I wasn’t panicked, and I didn’t feel restricted. I was calm, so calm I didn't question what was happening. I felt like I was being cleansed, like it was taking something bad out of my body, or I was willingly giving away my nutrients. Looking back I felt as though there was a bond, like it was my pet. I called for something, and it came, so why question or deny it? I sat there for what felt like 3 or 4 minutes before I realized what was happening. As those minutes went on, my stomach hurt more and more. The place where it was sucking on me began to feel painful, like it was bruising. I panicked, and I jolted. I began to tighten my grip on its neck and twist my hands in different directions. I felt like it was almost done, but I woke up too early. I felt it resist my grasp, and it struggled to continue. Then there was a hum. A distinctive sound and vibration occured so clearly bursting into my eardrums. It vanished. Disappeared as quickly as it came. I woke up immediately and felt a sudden urge to check the time. It had only been 10 minutes since my boyfriend left for work. This whole strange occurrence happened in 10 minutes? I know I couldn’t have fallen back asleep that quickly, and I know nothing could have come and gone from my apartment. But one thing was for sure, my stomach was in pain. It was sore, really sore. It didn’t feel like a digestive issue, and it didn’t feel like nerve pain. It really felt like I had a strong vacuum on that small area for too long. Unfortunately, no I did not check to see if there was a mark, which I regret to this day. 

Now, this is all fun and games, but I know there were many things that happened before I went to sleep that would contribute to such a strange dream. First of all, my sleep was out of whack, and I went to bed at around 2am. I recently started a lifestyle change of counting my calories and keeping track of my sugar intake. I also was doing my first ab workout in a very long time an hour before I went to sleep. Earlier the day before, I ordered a vacuum, a much needed household item for our new apartment, and something I was looking forward to getting. And lastly, it’s quarantine. Everyone is under a lot of stress as we watch the world change quickly into uncertainty, and we have all been inside for weeks now. I myself have gone crazy trying to find things to do, since all of my hobbies were outside with other people. There have also been many reports of very vivid dreams occuring for thousands of other people during this time for these reasons. 

I have always found dreams interesting, and try to analyze them as best I can right after they happen. Our brains are complex, and find very creative ways to try and process our everyday life and emotions. But I can’t deny that this felt real. I really believe this happened to me. I can explain a dream away as much as I want, but why did my stomach hurt so much for hours afterward? And only on that one side in the circular shape where it clung to me. Yes, I did an ab workout, but why didn’t my whole abdomen hurt? I think of this often, and have been wanting to share this for a while. 

I love hearing alien experiences, and supernatural occurrences, so I thought I would share one of my own. I haven’t found a similar experience when it comes to the look of the creature, or a story of an alien sucking on someone on the internet yet. But maybe sharing this will encourage others to come forward to share their story. Please if you, or someone you know, or you have read about a similar experience, please send it my way, I would really appreciate it and would love to hear it.

Thanks"
88,How to contact them?,Abductions,19,"Hey everybody!

I have been reading this subreddit this week and I gotta say I am fascinated, impressed and scared lol

Some people here seem to have some kind of psychic connection and can contact them (aliens obviously)? Dunno

I was wondering if any of you guys deliberately managed to get in contact with any species. And how

I assume the most common answer is going to be ‘they contact/find you, not the other way around”

But I am curious about it regardless

Take care and thank you for reading. Stay safe!"

91,How to aliens chose who to abduct?,Abductions,7,Do you think there’s any sort of criteria they look for in terms of who to study/ make contact with?
92,How have your memories surfaced?,Abductions,5,"Hey y’all. Life long experiencer here. I first had physical contact (with conscious recollection) when I was a teenager. I found out a few years ago during a channeling session that I’ve been abducted multiple times growing up. And that I’ve also been on ships. I was told the purpose of these abductions were to gather viable genetic material to be used for hybridization purposes. I also found out i have many hybrid children.  

I don’t have any conscious recollections of my abductions though. I had a recession done a few years ago from someone well known in the field and still didn’t have much luck remembering. The person who facilitated the recession told me that they’ve done a really good job at screening my memory. I was curious how others have gone about remembering their abductions later in life. Any techniques or meditations perhaps? Or did it come back naturally when it was meant to. All insights appreciated. Cheers!"

94,Lifetime of contact?,Abductions,15,"Good day, I wanted to start this by saying that since I have memory I have been dealing with this phenomena. I am an educated blue collar American middle class worker, but I come a rural very small Mexican town. I have nothing to hide, lose or gain by expressing my experiences. Now that the pentagon is allowing the truth to come out, I would like to tell my truth as well.

I will start my first experience back in the late 90's, one day at my grandma house, me and my cousin claimed to the ceiling, we were looking at the sky and the stars, at one point by the close range of mountain, as far as two miles away, we began to see what looked like a fire ball, moving in a very wavy manner, up and down in small and slow strokes, something out of mind for me at that time. I had never seen things of that nature, so we called up one of our aunts, she joined us on the ceiling, and as we pointed the ball, she saw it, some of my cousins also were able to caught a sight of it, but a few minutes it just disappeared on the mountain range. At that time we knew it was not airplanes because of the distance from the mountain tops, we live in a such remote area that we barely ever see helicopters. My aunt and cousins agreed that we had seen a witch flying. To me at the point was believable, and went with this theory for many years to come. 

Another time around this time happened to me that while I was walking home from soccer practice, I happened to pass by the corner of a street, where I was turning right, I saw the glimpse of a very blueish light, maybe a rod of about 10m long. A light that back then to me it was as weird as nothing else similar I had since, now a days we have LEDs but back then we did not have this technology in the masses and nor in the size I saw the object to be. When I got home, I told my mom the story still buzzed by the question on my mind. Another very weird situation would arrive a day when in town I saw this shirt with a picture of a common green(gray) alien, the moment I saw that image, my mind went bizarre, it was kind of logic defying, my mind could not figure out what was so familiar and graspable about the image. I had to buy the shirt and began to do my research more into why the image was so palpable for me. One day as I arrived wearing my shirt to my grandma house, she saw it and mention her story, she said that the monita that visits her looked like the monitos on my shirt.

Her story used to go like this; some nights there is a monita(doll) which visits her, this doll always comes down from the ceiling and trespassing the north wall. The doll always does this and with it always has a small flashlight on the hand. For this very reason I had and many other people had stayed with her, because according to her stories even if the doll does not hurt her, she does not feel very safe, she even had a second bed in her room for guests. She also mentioned many times that she can feel when the doll will visit her. As a kid, I saw nothing wrong with this story since I heard it since a kid, and myself had gone to stay with her, and never seen the doll. There is no way she would make this up either since it was a story she would tell everyone, adults her daughter/sons, everyone who would listen. Some aunts and uncles believed that it was a ghost that was protecting a treasure there at my grandmas house. I believed their story for many years, and I ignore it until later in my life when I wanted to really understand it, and I know for a fact that my grandma was no crazy, or even mentally ill. I asked around about the story around my family, she had given description  of the monita, she mentioned a weird smell, big black eyes, very doll like clothes, and a flashlight in the hand. One time I was reading about abduction stories, when someone mentioned that aliens visit them by coming through the roof, slowly landing on the floor. Then my grandma story made more sense to be a visitation rather than some illusion or dream.

One of the most shocking stories was when I was playing volleyball during my school break, when a team member bounced the ball up high, I ran to bring the ball back to the court, when I look up to see the ball, right on the far end of the local mountain, I saw a small cloud. Very unusual to see just one small cloud in the sky, but there was something that caught my attention even more than that small cloud, a small dark triangle, right by the small cloud. I was so astonished and shocked that I did not care if other people were seeing it, as I was looking at it, it began to move in a horizontal manner towards the small cloud, its color began to turn more metallic grey . Once the triangle joined the cloud, I expected the object to come on the other side, except it never did. Once I recover my mind, I asked couple of my team members if the had seen it, obviously they did not. Words will never suffice how this experience changed my life. For days, I had not idea of what to make of my sight, I wanted to believe that maybe it was an illusion, I felt that my whole perspective of my life and future needed to be rewritten, and I had not idea on what to believe this time around. 

My next event came in a night, in late 90's. I had waken up during the night, as I was woken up, I felt a presence, I turn to my bed side and saw what I thought to be a tall shadow, and it came to mind that it might have been my dad had arrived from the USA and had come see me. Then the shadow start moving towards the door, so I turn to keep sleeping and thought to myself how happy I was going to be when I wake up later that day to go see the stuff my dad had brought. The morning came, I woke up and ran to my mom's room, asking for my dad. My mom said that my dad had not arrived, and that I might have been dreaming. I know it was not a dream, and I know no one else was there because the size of the shadow was too tall to be my mom's or my sister's. Not far from this happening, one night I woke up while I felt like flying on my bed, I remember enjoying it so much, because the wind would hit my face as I was flying ON MY BED, it was an amazing feeling, then a memory of been pin down a bed, with the typical grey aliens around me, looking at me and telling me stuff I could not understand, I even remember thinking if they were speaking English to me( I knew only Spanish at this time). I began to feel very edgy, I remember I wanted to get lose and leave, and as I turned to one side to get off the table, I saw what looked like a human, an elder and bold man with glasses, among the other beings, this of course came to me like a relief, I thought to myself, that he could be a human doctor   
 and he would be able to protect me. Then I woke up, on my bed, I was still feeling the bright lights on my eyes. Then in the morning, as I recalled the 'dream' while getting off bed, I saw by the middle of my bed, very small blood steins. So it occurred to me that I was bleeding, quickly I looked to my legs and feet for the cut, to my surprise I found three little dots on one of my knees, that fitted perfectly the blood stains. I told my sister about it, she just laughed, she probably thinks I was playing a joke on her. 

As I grew older I began to feel and see patterns on this phenomena that I was going through. For one I noticed that before one of this unexplained lose time and weird dreams would happen, I would feel uneasy and restless for up to a week before it would happen. Many times I would ask my mom if I could sleep in her room because the freight I would feel at night. As you can imagine, one night I went to sleep in my mom's room, and the weird dream began, I was pinned on a vertical wall, not lights just pinned there against it, and then some beings began to fill the room, I remember them trying to talk to me or tell me something to ease me down, for I was already feeling edgy. This time though I thought that if this was a dream, if I screamed to the top of my lungs my mom would hear me, therefore it would be a dream. I have the memory of thinking that time I was not going to allow them to do whatever they did to me. I remember trying to escape and even hitting a creature, next thing I woke up on my mom's room. Feeling the numbness of some of my body parts, obviously this was not a dream either.  

A few time later, I migrated to the USA. Where I began a new life, but the feeling of been visited didn't stop there, if anything after I moved here, things began to get more serious. In this country I have had more 'visits' than I could remember in Mexico. With life experience I can tell you that I am able to differentiate from memories and dreams. But I cannot tell you if this is real of just my wishful thinking, I cannot tell you that I have a memory of me talking to them and asking what is going on. I cannot tell you if they are here, and they are good or bad. But I can tell you that if they exist and they had been following and guiding me for all this years, it means to me that they are benevolent."
95,Maybe I used to be abducted?,Abductions,4,"The memories are so faded now but reading through your guys posts I remembered something that happened to me when I was little. I remember having this vivid dream over and over, and it was so consistent that I can still remember that I used to think about it a lot when I was a child. It was just like one segment where I was laying on something that looked like a white bed and was just the exact size of my body. Everything was so white almost fluorescent. I also remember seeing both of my parents next to me behind a frame that had round corners looking at me so worried almost crying, but I couldn’t talk to them. I always thought that it was just a weird dream and also I never got scared of it. I remember once I told my mom about it and she didn’t say anything to me or maybe she wasn’t listening. I think I’m going to ask her now lol"
96,Need to tell this to someone.,Abductions,23,"Good evening to everyone. I feel like it’s time for me to put this out there as it has weighed heavily on my mind lately. I’m a 44-year-old male living in southeast Georgia. When I was 10 years old, I used to live only a couple of houses down from my little cousin.  He was 8. He and I and a few of the other neighborhood children would play what was called flashlight tag.  That’s basically where you play hide and seek, but it’s at night and the person who is “IT” uses a flashlight to spot people and catch them.  Whoever is found first becomes “IT.”  Our Neighborhood was in a rural area with a couple of farms and fields around the vicinity. It was pretty much out in the countryside.  It was my cousin’s turn to be “IT” and I decided I would hide in the pasture directly behind our house. I jumped the small fence behind our yard and got into the (fairly large) pasture where there is a large oak tree near a small pond. My plan was to hide in that tree from my cousin.  The others were scared to go into that field but I wasn’t, so I took advantage of that fact. As I was running top speed to get to the old oak while my cousin loudly counted down, I remember experiencing what I can only describe as two rapid, consecutive up close “flashes” right in my face  which stopped me in my tracks. Just, *FLASH FLASH* back to back over a half of a second’s time, maybe. I stood there a bit confused wondering what that was and then dismissed it, remembering to get to the oak tree. I got to it and climbed up onto the lowest hanging limb and made my way towards the trunk and straddled the base of the branch and waited a bit. After a few seconds I heard my mother’s voice screaming my name from our back porch in the distance and she sounded upset and worried. So I climbed down out of the tree and began to walk back to the fence to our back yard, thinking I was in trouble for being on the neighbor’s property. As I walked, I noticed a police car on the far side of the pasture with the red and blue lights on display, and what looked like an officer shining his flashlight across the field back and forth slowly. I thought I was in a lot of trouble. I ran back to the fence and hopped it and ran across the yard, seeing my mother on the back porch in her nightgown. The door was open behind her, illuminating her form.  She was again  calling out my name and I said “I’m here mama!” And ran to the porch waving.  She saw me and I remember her clutching her chest and running down the steps to grab me and hug me saying “oh thank GOD!”  I was confused and said “am I in trouble?” She said “no but where have you been?? I was so worried! We called the police! We didn’t know what happened to you!” And I told her it was ok, I was just hiding in the oak tree in the pasture from my cousin. “Didn’t you hear me calling you???” but I didn’t know how long she had been calling and I never really asked her about the situation again, nor did I think to tell anyone about those two flashes I experienced. I am a very agnostic and skeptically minded person who doesn’t scare easily, but this experience has me a bit anxious to think about. The only reason I thought to post it here was because my cousin and I recently talked about that night. He told me they were all looking for me for hours and asked me what I did that night and where I really went. So. I told him all that happened as I remembered it, and he got me to start looking into it.  Any thoughts and opinions are welcome. This experience is a mystery to me and I am terrified of what it implies if it’s more than just the confused memory of a 10 year old."
97,I hope I fell asleep at the wheel. . .I hope.,Abductions,28,"Feel free to ask any questions. Prove to me I fell asleep and I will be happier and in your favor forever. 

This happen a few months ago. So I work as a nurse and started a new job 45 mins away at a nursing home that pays well and has the shift I want. The shift I normally work is weekend doubles evening and overnights a 16 hour shift a day. But they needed me to work morning and evening this particular weekend I agreed. (switching my sleeping schedule) The night shift nurse who came to relieve me was late sunday night. I was behind on charting anyways so I didn't get upset. I was giving report and heard a yelling, resident on the floor. (He was with it and said he fell, he was wearing warm socks that are not non slip sent ER due to his hip.) More charting state reportable if broken stay to help she's a pecker on typing. Get out of work at 1-2 a.m (close to a 20 hour shift after an 17 hour shift the day before) I was dead on my feet but I felt well enough to drive. (My car is very tiny, I can't sleep in it, a smart for 2, and my friend wouldn't answer the phone.)

The way I go home has a lot of twists and turns. I travel by the lake and love the water so it helps stay awake. Instead of the shorter 40 min path. I go past a small town twist turns and woods, listen to my book to keep awake. About halfway home. (Notice I left my glasses work cause I'm an idiot who puts them down to chart and dont notice I cant see until I'm like oh yeah the world isn't suppose to be a little blurry. I do this a lot)

At the next turn there is a bright light like a spot light coming through the woods. I continue on a little bit further still in the wooden area and towards where the bright light is coming from. Bend in the road once more, on the side of of the road where the night before I saw a hit deer, was what looked to be a very thin man, skin tight black clothes kneeling over the deer that is still there his back is towards me, I thought he looked weird but my glasses were gone and my eyes are starting to blur a little more. The spot light was coming from the woods pointing towards the man. I remember thinking about the light thinking about how they got their vehicle through the woods. But again I was dead. I try to pause my book, and and my car is slow down nearly stopped. The man starts to move from the deer, I roll down my window and ask , ""Is everything okay? Need any help?"". Not really looking at him. I thought that maybe it was a different deer and he hit it. I am about 15-20 or so feet in-front of them. My car is stopped at this point. I am still trying to get my book to stop my touch screen radio isn't working well (happens to freeze sometimes) so I pick up my phone and stop my book.  I really look towards the man after looking away from my phone, and realize that he or she really isn't a human . I freeze. It has stood up and faced me. The head is huge like they describe aliens to be with huge black eyes. Except it is tall, not a tiny thing like they show on TV. It starts to walk towards my car. I can't breath, I can't move. I felt like I couldn't even think, everything just felt like it froze. I heard a voice not mine that sounded like it was just in my head say. ""Sleep.""

I blink. It is gone along with the deer. I look at my clock almost 4 a.m. My car is in park now and I am pulled over with no memory of doing so. My window is still down, I look at my phone which is still in my hand, I open it and my book is still stopped in the same place. I try to call my sister but she wouldn't answer (asleep). So I call my job. They answer, I ask about my glasses and the resident. I eventually tell her I fell asleep and wanted to talk to someone so it doesn't happen again and everyone is asleep. She stayed on the phone till I got home. 

(I wouldn't call this an abduction but an encounter but I lost that time. Also, I have never fell asleep driving before or without meaning to kind of insomniac, I dont have vivid dreams, I am so uncool I never drink do drugs or anything interesting. I am use to late hours because I can't say no when another nurse or aide need help so I stay late a lot)

I don't think I fell asleep, but I pretend I did so I don't go insane. I haven't told anyone this. It scares me just thinking about it. If I did fall asleep I could have hurt someone. If I didn't then \~ 

TL;DR Worked super late into the night after a long shift the day before and either put my book on pause pulled over and rolled down my window with no memory of being so responsible. Or saw an alien and asked if they needed help and they knocked me out and stole a deer."

99,I felt something slide into my brain,Abductions,6,"I was doing meth at the time, but I literally had the sensation of something sliding into my brain. I got an MRI done and nothing was there. Do you think it could be aliens?

Also, I walked out of my room and back into it and the carpet was perfectly vaccuumed and there was a perfect rectangle in my carpet. I have a feeling aliens did it."
100,A curious case of being lost to the night,Abductions,5,"  

**A curious case of being lost to the night**

&#x200B;

The following event took place 8 years ago, give or take.  The west coast of Scotland; to be more precise: the UK, - Scotland, the area was Wemyss bay, in a small village called Skelmorlie:- the end of the line for Glasgow and the river Clyde!   

My long term girlfriend and I had flown up to Glasgow to stay with some close friends. They had moved from England years ago – they’d tried getting me to visit for years, I’d always put it off, joking it was trap! Inevitably I would be lynched as payback for atrocities brought on by the ‘southerners’!  Obviously I didn’t really believe this, it was just a stupid joke yet I did have a sense of foreboding which is impossible to explain. But here I was, looking down into the gloomy mouth of the Clyde - Lights blinking from the ferries, as they journeyed to and fro with the isle of Bute. – Sporadic flashes in the sky, as the lighthouse cast its warning to the boats.

They had a beautiful rambling house of Victorian age; huge bay windows that looked down into the murky motionless waters separating Bute from the mainland. Complete with arches, battlements and turret, the house came with a self-contained flat high up on the 3rd floor. A reclusive musician lived alone in the turret composing modern classical music on a grand piano; seldom seen, he’d appear at the window occasionally. 

We had gone up to Scotland to celebrate New Year, by the 31st December, a thick layer of snow had descended along with a huge drop in temperature.

I will now attempt to tell my tale: as i said it took place about 8 years ago when i was about 42/43. I’m very unfamiliar with where i was staying; it was a large Victorian house in a small coastal village. It’s a large house on a fairly minor road in the centre of the village. There are many houses on the street and they are all old and large.  The winter was a particularly cold one, in fact extremely cold. So much snow in fact, the airport was closed for a few days. i guess we were staying there for 6 days and this particular event took place on new year’s eve.

We had gone to a local pub and returned back to our friend’s house for a small gathering.  I hadn't really had that much to drink, and I remember most of the evening up to a certain point.  If my memory is correct I was in an upstairs room chatting with my partner, and my mate’s brother who is a commercial airline pilot. There were also a couple of other people that I don't know so well - it would have been about 12.30a.m/1a.m. I then proceeded downstairs into a larger room where a sound system was playing –it’s from here my memory starts to get sketchy. I got talking to this young looking guy who I think was DJ’ing at one point. We made small talk, the music is loud, it’s hard to hear what he’s saying and my last concrete memory is of him introducing me to his girlfriend…

………

and then nothing

And I mean NOTHING!

The next thing I’m aware of is, it’s dark and there’s no noise. It is calm and silent.  I’m stood in a room, I can vaguely make out items of furniture that look ornate and unfamiliar. I remember a chaise longue, I remember a fire place, the room is warm. I then start to hear voices.  The voices become louder and then I become aware of shouting being directed at me; other people joining in. More people shouting at me, demanding to know what i'm doing, why I’m there and how did I get in. I’m confused. Very confused.  I’ve no idea where I am. Nothing looks familiar. No-one is recognisable. I keep asking where I am. There is much confusion going on. Other people come into the room, voices become more raised; i get the hint that some of the guys there are starting to get aggressive in their questioning. i am completely bewildered, I believe I was in shock, I have absolutely no idea where I am - nothing is recognisable. I sense the air of aggression growing, I can only think to apologise, There are 3 or 4 guys demanding details from me, I just keep apologising over and over saying I meant no harm. I remember being threatened with what I think was a poker for the fire and I began begging for mercy – I also vaguely remember one of their girlfriend trying to calm the guys down and being relatively sympathetic however, a couple of the guys demanded I leave immediately. It all happens quickly but I  get shown to the door as its opened for me to leave.  As i look outside i see nothing, no lights, just a track leading into the trees. I try to explain I don't know where to go – I remember really begging them to tell me where I had to go, which way? I begged and begged for help which I think gave 2 of the guys bravado because they were screaming at me to fuck off or they were going to ‘do me’ one of the other guys I think wasn’t so aggressive and gave me the direction I needed to walk down the lane to get off the property and back onto a public road. As I walked away I continued pleading with them that it was so cold and I didn’t know where to go. I had no coat and I found out later it was between minus 15-20 Celsius. The aggressive ones followed me down the track still threatening me – I then became worried as we were away from the more rational sympathetic members of their group and we were kind of hidden amongst the trees. I carried on down the track through the trees, on into the darkness I got to the road and just kept walking. I can’t explain to you just how cold I was

As I walked through the darkness I was so scared. i could not understand what was happening, i did't know why I was here. i didn’t know where here is. i didn't know where i'd come from or where I was going. I think the cold took away all other thoughts. My only concern became getting out of the cold

i don't think i have ever experienced such cold. i can't remember how long it was but eventually i saw headlights - i waved my arms for the car to stop and it was a taxi! i remember getting in the cab and thanking the driver for what felt like he was saving my life. It was the first time in quite a while that I felt safe, however when the driver asked me where I wanted to go, I had no idea. My mind was blank. I had no idea where I wanted to go. I had no idea where I was.  I remember the taxi man asking if I had money - i had £10 on me and we agreed that he'd drive around until the money ran out and see if anything jogged my memory. After not very long the meter ran up to £10 and the driver said he'd have to drop me off. I pleaded with him that i couldn’t go back into the cold and out of concern he took me to the nearest police station.

It wasn’t a proper police station - it was one of these country police stations that is more like someone’s house. Anyhow there happened to be a couple of police officers in a car outside the building. The taxi man filled them in on me. I remember we went into this room which I think was somewhere where they kept uniforms and general equipment/supplies. I think I kept apologising for wasting their time blah blah blah, anyhow when they asked me my details i could not for the life of me remember my name. I didn’t know where I was from. i couldn’t remember my address - not even the city. I couldn’t tell them where and who I was staying with. I remember I could tell them where I was born but no details more than this. i then started to become very upset. i believe I started hyper ventilating. I remember sobbing asking the police why I didn’t know who I was or where I was from.

the police called the paramedics. I was put in the back of an ambulance. One of the medics found my phone in my pocket but it had no power however they had a charger and when he got it working he phoned the number that was the most used and thankfully it was my girlfriend’s number - she answered and told them where I should be. The medics checked me over and found the only concern was I was hypothermic. I said I did not want to go to hospital so kindly they drove me back to my friends where we were staying. I think it was now about 8.30am - when we pulled up at my friends place, i saw my girlfriend and it was as if all these memories started to come back. It felt like a rush which made me throw up a few times

so my partner and friends tried to understand where i had been all night - I explained to them the house that I had been in and it seems it was this old property I think may have been owned by the YMCA and they rented it out to holiday makers. Its surrounded by trees and is at the other end of skelmorlie to where we were staying. At the time it never really made sense as to why I ended up there and how! it was put down to me probably doing some psycho active drugs, maybe mushrooms or E's/skunk and too much alcohol, but i know that was not the case. My last real memory of being at my friends house i felt quite sobre - i remember having a fairly sobre conversation with my mates brother, the pilot.

I think of this night often. One memory that came back was of me being shown something. what ever it was, this something had the most beautiful absorbing colours that captivated me. i have the memory of being with someone where we didnt have a conversation as such but they were showing me something and i could see these colours swirling into each other. the being with me was goodlooking. i couldnt for sure say if it was male or female but i get the feeling it was a feminine being. we were somewhere very quiet and there was an air of tranquility and safeness. i was speaking to this being but i'm not sure that i was actually saying the words or if i was just thinking them but it was along the lines of how everything that i was being shown was perfection

i wish i could remember more.

anyhow the reason i have come here to pass my story on is that i hoped by typing this out it might have jogged my memory and also i have read or listened to someones story that made me think maybe i too was abducted. Was I dropped off at the wrong house. I think there were similarities to the 2 houses – both old and large. I don’t know how I would have got into the other house. There was no damage or noise of me getting in. I think I had been asleep on the chaise longe at the YMCA house and when I awoke I started to look around the room and there were some other people asleep in there, how I didn’t initially wake them up is another mystery. It’s the most bizarre thing I have ever been involved in. the only bizarre experience that I’m aware of

the rationale for this is why on earth i would set off on a journey across the village without a coat or anything warm on perhaps the coldest night of the year

there were similarities to my friends house and the house that i found myself in. i don't know this part of the country at all - its a mystery how i could have found this holiday house and found my way into the house. the house isnt visible from the road- could i have been delivered to the wrong house by mistake

what happened to my memory?

who was this other being and what were they showing me"
101,My experience,Abductions,7,"I wanted to share this because for me it actually changed me, and im not stupid, before this happened I was the type of person to laugh at or dismiss abuctees/alien experiences as hoaxes to gain popularity, or just as mentally ill people, but for me it really happened, and for the rest of my life I will always think of as a real experience, because i remember the feeling of complete terror, being completely sober, and completely clear, in the middle of the night, and it wasnt pleasant at all.  Before I start, know that I have nightmares just like anyone else and I know how to differentiate between a bad dream and reality. This will always be reality to me.  I woke up at 3:00 am roughly and I thought I would go get a drink I was parched, but when I started too I had this weird feeling like everything was right, everything looked right but darker, if I opened the blinds there was still no light and if I focused on something, like really focused on the details of the floor or the wall or anything but really closely the room would reset with me in it but the details would change slightly again like I was put in a room, or a simulation of a room, my room, to make me feel comfortable, but every time I focused on the details of anything I would start over again in the doorway of the same room, almost as if every time I noticed something out of place they would restart the simulation I was in.  I remember Crying, and pleading with whatever it was to let go of me or kill me, and it Answered, this was when I realized that whatever I thought, if I thought a question, it would answer it instantly just as fast as I could think of it, it answered almost too fast because my brain would think of multiple questions At once, so all I would hear was responses, yes, no , but so quickly that I had to focus on what I was asking and make sure that was the only thing I was thinking at that time, focus on That one question so that I knew the response i got was for that question. Anyways Im tired of typing, I hope some of u enjoy my experience because it’s real for me, and it terrifies  me to this day, when I wake up and the room looks the same but different I start to pray that I don’t get taken again."

103,Follow up to my post yesterday looking for shows that use real claims of alien abduction and then discuss and re-enact them.,Abductions,7,"So I got a few answers that weren’t what I was asking for like The fourth kind, fire in the sky, etc. I was specifically looking for documentary type shows where they go over real alien abduction claims and then re-enact the abduction. 

I wanted to provide some examples so that people understand what I’m looking for and what I am not looking for. Also I think all of you will really enjoy these abduction shows. 

I wrote the stuff below in the comment section of my post replying to someone but thought it would make a good post of its own for others that are interested in the topic of alien abduction and re-enactments. 

There was a show in 1991 that did a great job of it called “Visitors from the unknown”. It’s on amazon prime for free if anyone else wants to watch it. James Earl Jones narrates it and I loved it. They did a sequel in 1992 called “Visitors from the unknown - Doorways” that has UFO/ghost/psychic mixed. 

Here is a link to original Visitors from the unknown 
https://watch.amazon.com/detail?asin=B08234S6SQ&territory=US&ref_=share_ios_movie&r=web

Here is a link to the doorways episode from 1992

https://watch.amazon.com/detail?asin=B082FQYRMJ&territory=US&ref_=share_ios_movie&r=web

If you know of any other shows, documentaries, docuseries, YouTube videos, etc. that are just like these shows please share them below and how to watch them. A direct link would be great but at minimum please list where we can watch it like Prime, Netflix, Sailing the high seas."

If you can tell me where I can watch it like YouTube, prime, Netflix, etc. I would appreciate any links you can share."
105,"I really want to get this off my chest, my experience being abducted for over 9 years.",Abductions,16," 

First off I want to say that im not a native speaker, therefore my grammar might not be the best.

Im a 17yo, 18 in May, who went through over 9 years of constant abduction and I want to share my history.

This whole thing began when I was 6yo, I clearly remember going to sleep with a strange feeling just to wake up during the night with a constant noise coming from my ears, this noise got louder as time passed by and it suddenly stopped, that was the moment when a thing entered my room and stared at me for what seemed like hours. Over the course of the following weeks this thing got closer up to a point where it was just a few inches apart from my face, I could clearly see it, it was a grey.

This kept happening for literal years at least twice a week, sometimes I would wake up in the floor, sometimes I would wake up during the night feeling something being injected in my arms, sometimes I would be covered in nasal blood and sometimes I could see them touching my face. During my firsts years going through this i learned about sleep paralysis, but I was able to move before they entered my room and even when they were already inside I could move my hands and sometimes even my arms, which always ended with them going away.

The last time they came, which was almost 3 years ago, I was able to grab one of their arms really tightly, it felt horrible tbh, and when I realized they were no longer in my room. 

But even now I can’t sleep properly bc I almost daily wake up feeling like im being watched, feeling an ominous presence in my room 

Im not entirely sure what happened during those years, all I know is that something horrible happened to me and I feel nothing but hate towards those greys or whatever they truly are. I was able to touch one of them and Im quite sure they are really physically weak so there’s the chance that I might be able to kill one of them, if they ever come back that’s it.

I’ve experienced a lot more and im willing to answer any question you might have. Also, what do you think this whole thing was? Being honest im not totally sure myself, it could be anything."

108,..was I abducted?,Abductions,9,"This story happened about two years ago. I understand there could be other explanations for this, but the feelings surrounding it are just really off to me, so I figured I should ask. 
I believe it was around 10 in the morning, I had been up for a while and was just laying in bed, but I had plans later that day so I decided to get up. I remember standing up. Then there's absolutely nothing. Complete blackness, and a feeling of being completely limp and unable to move. I fought to open my eyes, and when I did, I was across my bedroom, sat against the door like I had been propped up there. I wouldn't have been able to fall like that without falling backwards and hitting my head on the door, and I had no injuries. Sitting there I still felt completely limp, until I tried to move my body. It felt like a wave washed over me and suddenly I could move again, and I also felt like my body was mine again. It felt like I was coming back into my own body. I stood up, extremely wigged out, and went to check my phone. I had sent a message saying I was getting ready to the friend I had plans with, and that was 40 minutes ago. 

..somehow I had blacked out for 40 minutes without even knowing it? And had crawled across the room and sat by the door? 
I have no personal or family history of seizures or anything of the sort, and again, I was not injured. I didn't believe in extraterrestrials or anything at the time, so the possibility of abduction didn't cross my mind. Though I believe now, I don't know if this is congruent with other stories. Maybe it's something else entirely. I had almost forgotten about this, but it just came back into my head last night. Now when I think about it my eyes start to water and I feel really anxious. Any insight is appreciated. Will answer any questions.

Edit: I talked to the friend that I had messaged before this happened and they said that they didn't notice the time pass either, though they didn't have any experience. Could be coincidence, but interesting."
109,Twisting lights entering the center of forehead,Abductions,2,"Hello my little fellows, this story happened to me last month.

I was studying in my apartment, listening to chilling music (this one; OP note: listen to it with caution lol: [https://youtu.be/hrUuK6y4yng](https://youtu.be/hrUuK6y4yng)) when I got up to spend some time looking to the horizon; I saw some lights - seemed 3 or more - orbs that twisted and turned and suddenly came my way and entered the center of my forehead. They seemed to be one blue, one yellow and one red light that twisted and shuffled between them and from the horizon took an impressive speed and entered my head making noise of a sort o fan, spilling air and at the same time, impressively silent.

The next thing I remember is waking up listening to this soundtrack - do not remember putting any earbuds bud woke up with them , this track playing nd my watch\`s alarm biping.

The sound track: [https://youtu.be/dIAzpaHbUVU](https://youtu.be/dIAzpaHbUVU)

And also I\`ve been maintaining a Maithuna practice along (I\`m single) along with initial meditation practices, and also shamanic rites for the greater good, not for me.

&#x200B;

I also saw after waking up, from 3 to 7 bees - don\`t rememeber exactly the number. I wanted to catch them but they would not come my way.

Difficult to explain story, very unusual to what I’m used to live.

I wish I could tell it from happening or not but I’m more and more a believer that the truth is out there..."

112,Has anyone ever been revisited? I fear I may be soon,Abductions,45,"I posted an experience I had when I was a teenager about a week ago. Here’s the link: https://reddit.com/r/Abductions/comments/fk7uqu/memory_from_when_i_was_a_teenager/

I’ve had some strange things happen ever since. I’m not sure if these are all in my head or if the aliens that abducted me 15 years ago are attempting to revisit me.

Several nights ago I was in bed, not quite sleeping yet but a little tired and I suddenly heard this loud beeping sound inside my head. It was quite loud and seemed to repeat once every 5-10 seconds for about a minute or so. I’m fairly certain that only I could hear it as my wife was asleep next to me and didn’t react. After about a minute the beep stopped and was replaced by this static sound like when you would turn on an old TV. I’m not sure if my eyes were open or shut at this point but I could see all of this white and black distortion that completely took over my vision.  This went away after a few seconds and I found myself staring off the side of my bed unable to move. After a couple of minutes I regained the ability to think and move again and felt normal. I turned around and my wife was fast asleep. It was a startling experience.

Another weird thing happened last night while I was in bed. I was in a similar state of laying down, not quite asleep when I suddenly felt the room shake. I panicked at first thinking it was an earthquake, which coincidentally there was an earthquake in my state a few days earlier, but this felt different. It didn’t feel like the ground below me was shaking but rather the house was vibrating. This didn’t last long. When it stopped I heard this strange “whooshing” sound and saw a flash of light out the window, then everything was back to normal. Once again my wife slept through the entire experience.

I’m not sure if these experiences were sleep paralysis or some sort of hallucination or alien visitors. It seems strange that both of these experiences occurred within a week of sharing my abduction story on this sub. Is it possible my abductors are watching my activity or somehow read my post and are reaching out again?  Has anyone ever had a similar experience or am I losing my mind?"

115,Alien abduction of Betty and Barney hill- A real story,Abductions,3,"The September night of 1961 was the life-changing night for the young couple, Betty and Barney. A couple that lived in Portsmouth, Betty and Barney were civil servants where Barney worked in a post office and had to travel 60miles every day back and forth for work. Betty was handling State child welfare cases, and the biracial couple were devoted to their church and civil rights movement activities. The overworked couple finally took a short vacation to New Hampshire’s White mountain which they said was a spur of the moment decision like a much-delayed honeymoon. They had only $70 in their pocket and spent three days in the white mountains. 

However, the night of the third day became the night that changed the course of their life when they felt they were being followed by beaming light from the sky. The road to the house was empty, and the two-hour journey felt like forever as the beaming light did not stop following them. The couple got curious and stopped the car to check what the light was, and Betty saw through her binoculars. She exclaimed to Barney that he is ridiculous to think that it is a satellite or a star. Barney knew she was right as a jet or helicopter will not hover around in such a clear and silent night. 

Barney, who was a world war-II veteran and an avid plane watcher with an IQ of 140, knew it was something else. When the beaming light did not stop following them, Barney came out of the car 70 miles from the diner with a gun in his pocket and went into the woods. He saw the beaming light through the binoculars and was shocked to see an object as big as a jet and flat as a pancake. All he could say himself, “My God, what is this thing?” he recalled thinking. “This can’t be real.” He could not lift his hand to shoot and could see that behind the windows of the object men in gray uniform were watching him. 

Hysterical and confused, he ran towards the car as he felt that they would be captured. After two hours, the couple drowsy and confused walked into the house with the clothes ripped apart, watches not working and Barney’s shoes strangely scuffed, but the two hours of the drive completely vanished from their memories. After the incident, Betty had strange dreams and Barney developed ulcer and anxiety. After months of anxiety, they contacted Benjamin Simon, a psychiatrist and neurologist who specialized in hypnosis, a mainstream technique at the time.

Simon, the psychiatrist, helped them put the pieces together with the help of hypnosis and they discovered the Aliens abducted them. They were taken into a spaceship where they were separated from each other and extensive examination was conducted on each. In fact, Betty was so excited to see the aliens; she even talked to them and said that their leader looked like Hitler.

During the examination, the aliens took hair strands, clipped nails and scraped their skin that was then placed on a transparent material, not a glass slide. They also probed their head, eyes, ear, legs and spine with 4-6inches long needles that were connected to long wires. Betty was also given a crude pregnancy test which made her twist in pain. Gray beings were excited to see that Barney’s teeth were removable and Betty laughed saying that they were dentures. She stated that gray beings did not understand the concept of human ageing. While she was alone with the leader of the beings, she asked him where they were to which he jokingly replied, “if you don’t know where you are, there wouldn’t be any point in telling you where I am.” She even drew the star map, which was shown to her in the spaceship while she was under hypnosis. 

The story of Hill’s was published in the Boston Newspaper, and after that, there was nothing normal in their life. A book and movie were made on their story; debates were held whether the couple was hallucinating the whole thing, sleep-deprived, liars or were high on weed. Many theories came forward as it was the first time somebody told aliens abducted them. Before this incident, people shared stories of witnessing a spaceship or friendly encounters, but an account of the extensive examination was hard to believe. But, the imagery of gray beings with big eyes became the sci-fi character for many years. 

A renowned psychologist from Harvard, Richard J. McNally said, The “alien-abduction’ phenomenon, in my opinion, shows how sincere, non-psychotic individuals can develop beliefs about, and false memories of, incredible experiences that never happened.” Some psychologists claimed it is the result of sleep paralysis or hallucination, but Simon, the psychologist who performed hypnosis on the couple, felt they were not lying. He concluded the whole experience as a dream Betty had, and Barney absorbed the entire experience, thus making it a real encounter for their mind.

There were many debates on the popular encounter of Betty and Barney, which made Betty a renowned voice in UFO research. But, nobody can neither conclusively deny or accept whether the abduction happened or not. The abduction is a significant possibility as the years went by, but there was no change in Hill’s story, and they remembered vividly how things happened. They denied false memories or sleep paralysis as the possibility of what they experienced.

Edit: An artist by the name of Josh has contacted me and agreed to help me SHOW a lot of stuff to you all. Again, I won’t be showing things that could alter their plan or endanger my son, but simple stuff I will show. Thanks to Josh!

Edit: I’m sorry if I’m vague in answers. It’s easier if you guys ask very specific questions. “Does Apple still exist?” Will get a yes or no. If you’re wanting to know a specific thing, ask it. Don’t be in general. As I’ll give an in general answer. Half this stuff you all are more familiar with than I am. So I don’t know what to say when it comes to some things unless you ask specifics. And IF I seen or read about it or write it in my journal, I’ll be happy to tell you. 

Edit: it seems most of you expect the future to be some big epic utopia. It can be, but wasn’t when I went. There was cool stuff and things to learn that blew my mind but most things remained the same. Some of you were upset when I said doors just auto slid open. I guess you expected them to be magical portals or something. They just weren’t. What’s not broke.....
I’ll be relaxing pages upon pages from my diary but it takes awhile to have my friend help me ensure we cross out certain information. 
____________________________________________
This is a huge story that I’ve only spoke of with 2 people. One of which suggested we just make an anonymous account online and tell it. Get it off my chest. It’s extremely hard to hold something so big in. I am in my 70s now. Also note that one of those two people I told is the one typing this message now, as I have trouble with typing and my site. 

My name is Jack. I’ll only give first name. When I was 27, living in Detroit Michigan, 1975, I was “abducted” and taken to a place under (edit: near, not under. Typo? -theguy) what Lake Michigan. (I could see water near me and I wake up on the beach of the lake.)

I was sitting on my porch with my dog one evening and he started growling. I looked out into the dark but saw not a thing. Then I noticed him looking up and growling. So I looked up. Nothing. Suddenly he looks off to the right of my porch, growling. Nothing. I decided it was time to go in. I figured it was bats. The next thing I know I feel nauseous. Butterflies in the stomach. I feel very...floaty. Everything got brighter. I’m guessing I pass out. I wake up in a field. The wind is blowing heavily. My dog nowhere. I stand up and look around and it looks to be near dark. It was already 9 at night when all this started. 

The sky is an extreme purplish color and the ground looks strange. It looks like grass but not grass. A tarnish brown color and about 6-8 inches tall. Miles of it. Mountains off into the distance. It’s dark enough I can’t really see detail of things at long distances. I am confused but very aware. After a few minutes I’m starting to feel nauseous again. I drop to my knees because I felt like I wanted to throw up. As I’m hunched over looking at the ground, I see what resembles a line of ants. Only they aren’t ants. Imagine an ant but with two rear ends and wings. Black in color. Fast. I scoot about a good to the side as to not get them on me. Lean back and pass out again. 

I slowly wake up yet again and this time I’m at home. Standing on the porch a few feet from where I was. Dog is inside with door shut and barking viciously. I think about what happened and begin to tell myself I must have been dreaming. Fast forward a week and I’m in my kitchen cooking at noon. It’s Saturday. As I stand there I feel nauseous again. Instantly memories of what happened last week hit me. I pass out. 

When I come to this time, I’m in a city that is empty and looks like it’s falling apart. No one around. Wind again is blowing heavily. Sky is a dark purple color. I recognize these buildings. I mean as in they look like our buildings. Slightly different then what I’ve seen with some odd designs but for the most part, normal. I can see signs from businesses. Everything is grown over like it’s been here untouched for a long time. Cars looked similar but more rounded. Trucks, vans and cars looked like those hybrid fancy cars. I see a taxi and it too has that rounded luxury car look. 

This time, I don’t start to feel sick. I hear something behind me and when I turn around there is two people and next to them is what looks like a little child with a very large head and very large eyes. Weird skin color and naked. It startled me and I throw my fists up as if ready to fight. I yell out what the fuck is going on! And they begin to walk towards me. One starts speaking but I’m already yelling again. Who the fuck are you!?

They get about 10 feet from me and I’m staring back and forth at them and the little weird fella. The man begins to tell me that I am in the earth year 2956. 5 years after the event. I ask them what the hell is happening? They told me that they were taking a set number of people and showing them earth's future. A few hundred thousand people alive from my time and the future generations and showing them what earth will be like. 

They explain that a number of events took place that lead to a dead earth. Not dead dead but most creatures dead. I’m crying at this point out of fear. I was a 27 year old tough guy and am breaking down like I was picked on by a girl. My fists are still up this whole time. 

They continue. There is a set number of people from my generation as well as future generations that are directly responsible for this/can do something about it. Those people will all be shown. Those people will all be guided on how to avoid this. It’s been about 10 mins so far. I now finally ask a more serious question instead of threatening them. I say I don’t buy it as there would be some kind of paradox happening we are they trying to change the past to affect the future. The girl smiles. 

Immediately another question appears in my mind and I ask them what do I have to do with any of it? I’m not a leader or president or scientist. The girl responds that I will be the father of one. A boy that will grow up to be one of those things. I ask which one and they refused to tell me for now.

They asked me to follow them so I began to. We went into a torn up building and down several stairs into a bigger room. I can see several others doing different things. They are explaining to me that the future doesn’t have to be this way and I as well as those many others can change it. 

Skip ahead, I spend about 3 months there. They showed me as much as they could. I read through history books. I looked at technology. I asked a million questions. I got a million answers. All with only one rule, that I won’t try to use it for my own advantage/success. 

There’s a lot of in the middle stuff here but I feel it would be the length of a novel to have my friend type here on this website. 
I’ve spent the past 40+ years preparing. Raised my son to be in the position he is now and guided him. I got to stay for those 3 or so months because they weren’t going to do this again with me. 

The first time, when I appeared in the field, they said it was a test. To put me through the travel and send me back. If it’s successful, they make initial contact with the subject.

I’ve seen so much. I’m filled with joy and fear at the same time. Why am I speaking out about this now? It was never spoken with me about telling or not. It seemed irrelevant outside of specific details that could change the outcome. Like my son finding out certain details. The world is growing and even more connected since I was a boy. And since it’s been so many years, the itch to want to speak about it only grew stronger. My buddy here that’s typing all this told me of a website where you can anonymously speak with people. This is what I want to do now. 

Typing 3 months of information isn’t really going to happen but I would love to spill it all out over time to anyone who wishes to listen. So here I am. It was amazing and scary the whole time but a tale I must tell before my health runs out.

Edit: The moment I got home, I began to write everything in a diary for memory purposes. I have about 100 pages of everything I could remember. So much that I often have to read through it to remember I even wrote about a subject. I’m 72 years young and my memory is trash. So every detail that came to me the first couple months I was back I would write. 

Edit: random entries will be entered from here down. There are so many things to discuss but I have to add them as we go unless I write some big book filled with it all, which I’m not going to do. So I’ll mention things directly related to questions and as I think of them. 

1. The only alien I seen was the grey guy. When I asked of alien life they said they are aware of many but only directly interact with the grey guys kind. Most confirmation of life outside earth is just from seeing evidence of it from telescopes and satellites. Tons of bacterial life known on distant planets but intelligent life is only in the 20s. Around 20 or so known lifeforms. Most of which we don’t communicate with at all. Just evident via seeing satellites around planets many light years away. 

2. The issue is that they took me to a future where earth is in peril. So I couldn’t just walk the streets and check out the latest Hollywood news. I had to use a Wikipedia type of computer thing that I could search through that contains all of mans past. Yes I looked to see if Trump won. And yes, he does. He will attempt to run a third time as well. Edit: because a few of you mentioned this, I’ll be more clear. Reading news of my time. About 100 years worth. When I came across stuff regarding trump he wasn’t the trump we know today. I was interested in just seeing who became president and seen a guy named Donald with a lot of references in news when I searched his name. Trump attempts to run a third time, what I mean by this in other comments is that in his second term, he speaks of attempting to run again and wants law to change to allow him to. That’s all. EndEdit. But it’s the president AFTER trump that you will love. This is the guy that puts in the effort we need to happen to ensure this future doesn’t happen.

3. Animals. For the ones I seen they are all the same. The only NEW animals I seen were mainly new water species. Fish that looked so weird and some weird looking ant like creatures.

4. War. There are many ways that happen over 900 years but all seemed to be minimal. Nukes are a thing of the past. I don’t want to mention what terrors isn’t use as to not influence the idea to happen sooner. I would lay at night over the 3 months and just read read read. 

5. Food. The fruit was all the same and good. But the normal dishes they prepared where just plain ole nasty to me. They weren’t big on meat. The only meat we ate were fish. The rest was vegetable and fruit based. 

6. The average life expectancy of humans in the 2900s is 140-150. It seems to be the max. However there is a lot done with consciousness transferring. In that time, again, earth is in peril so I couldn’t see a lot of this in action. The world was too torn up for any of it to be important. But before the events took the earth, I read about in 2700s we pretty much know the mind like the back of out hands. And major successes in digitally copying it. However this becomes a thing of the past when copied minds would start to act insane. Being trapped in darkness. I read that they wouldn’t last long either. Kind of like when a persons head gets cut off, for less than 10-20 seconds they are conscious and aware. The same with mind transferring. The moment they upload the mind into a machine it lasts only a short while before fading. Talking rubbish like they were getting drunker. Slurring. Then gone. Some stories reported them screaming.

7. Getting a lot of messages about technology. Sorry I was specific. As I mentioned I seen a gadget that measured what they called the “happiness” of plants. Happier equals healthier. Have no clue what it did to do that. 
Their computers looked similar to ours. A keyboard and all was touch screens. I don’t know about their windows or whatever it’s called. It was all a shade of blue. They touched things on screen and things opened up. Same as us. The box it came in was silver. Small. So you had a screen and then beside it was a tiny silver box with cables. It was about the size of a cell phone. Some people were walking around with cell phone like boxes too. But most used a watch type of gadget that projected a screen onto their arm. Then they would touch their skin as a screen. 
There was gadgets everywhere. Blindly lights all over the place. Maybe I can get an artist to reproduce it for everyone I dunno. It looked way cool but I can barely use these techno gadgets today let alone understand any of that stuff.  I did see they use those drone things. I don’t know what they did specifically but I seen one fly close to the ground and a red laser light shot out the bottom of it over objects. Then would fly off and repeat over other objects. Some kind of scanner? There’s a million other questions I didn’t ask because if I did ask about every little thing I seen we would have spent the whole time there with me not shutting up. I just looked..eyes wide open and confused and moved on. Only things that interested me did I ask about.

8. How did the time travel stuff work?
After hours of words I don’t understand from them during daily chit chat, the only bits I understood was that it takes a lot of energy. Which they collected from a small black hole that orbits our solar system. That it was discovered hundreds of years ago and they sent satellites to orbit it and collect energy that they would then send to earth or other places in the solar system. 
When I asked BUT HOW did they control time, the main guy I hung with said that they bend it. Then something like if you can move an object through space faster than the speed of light, it goes back in time. As for how they specifically send something to a specific year...I have no clue. I didn’t think to ask that question. I was confused by most of it. 

9. Why me? Apparently because my son is to grow up and be apart of the actions needed to fix all this. I know exactly what he’s to do but I can’t tell him. Only influence him. They said if I mess up or he ventures off the trail, we can reset again. I met two others just like me who was also brought to the future. Only they were the ones, not their kids. They were instructed differently than I was. Things they needed to do. Whereas I was instructed on things regarding my son. Who today, is doing what he should do. He’s not super famous but he is well known and will become known worldwide soon, because of his contributions. 

10. Scientific discovery’s/changes in our time?
I found out that in 5 years, 2025, we will have first confirmation of intelligent life elsewhere. I know that in the next 20 years we will cure nearly all of the diseases that ails us. Except cancer, it will become similar to a cold or the flu. You get it and see a dr then it’s gone. But never cured. I remember reading about laws that changed in America. Within our lifetime pedophiles will begin to be executed as long as there is concrete proof. Seen some celebrity deaths. Trump dies at 77 years of age due to heart failure during his second run as president. Bill Gates a couple of years after. A young star named Jonas or something like that, one of three brothers, is the only survivor in a plane crash that takes the life of his two brothers. Alive but in a wheel chair. This happens in 2023 I believe. There was some other celebrity stuff but it wasn’t what I was interested in. Just random news that I would see while reading about the years gone by.

11. Tell us about YOU, Jack.
Well, as I said I am 72 years of age. I spent most of my life as a roofer until I got into my 50s where I then became a security officer. Did that for years and retired. I’ve been married since I was 28. Had only one child. My son who’s now in his 30s. I know a lot of this is vague but understand I have to be very vague. Speak in general terms for a lot of this stuff. Some is fine to specify but anything related directly to the plan, I have to skim on details as to not ruin it. Anyways, I grew up in Detroit. Live there my whole life. I’ve moved since then to Florida as all of us elders tend to do.  My son has a family of his own so I’m a grandpa of three amazing kiddos. This event happens to me some 45 or so years ago. I’ve kept diaries and logs for memory purposes ever sense. Tried to draw some stuff in it.  Medically I’m healthy. Mentally I’m sound. I’m just a man who experienced something so amazing and planned to speak about it towards my final days. Which is now. As I’ve said in comments, I’m not here to educate or spoil the secret. I’m here for me. It’s been a huge relief today alone. I feel when I pass that I will no longer have as much on my shoulders to carry. Thanks to my friend recommending I do this. I’m old now. So I’m not on my toes when laying it all out there. I skim through my diary for answers as this was so long ago. But I’m more than glad to answer questions as long as they don’t risk my son nor the plan.

12. Looking through diary. The criteria for determining if a species is intelligent or not is if they are able to leave their planet or translate languages.

13. Purple sky. I asked about why the sky was more purple than anything. They mentioned that was one of the fails of man. Emissions and global warming. It was the most beautiful thing. It affected the color of the sky and would eventually render the atmosphere unbreathable. As for the science behind why purple, I do not know. Didn’t understand a lot of what they were explaining about it. 

14. The doors they had were all automatic. You walked near and they just opened and closed. You could lock the door by pressing a button next to it. The walls were of a metal content. Some silver looking but mostly white.

15. I didn’t get to see some of this but read about it. As all news and info had been stored in a database. I was free to read anything considered public on a tablet type device, which I did for hours every night I was there. I read of technology a bit. Before everything went astray, people didn’t no longer go to a dr physically unless it was to get a prescription. Most of your health was managed from home. Your urine and stool samples could be read and information sent to dr if you allowed it. There was a blue scan button on the side of the toilets. You could also have something out inside you that monitored your heart rate and many other body functions ever second. And when things like cholesterol etc were starting to go bad, you could get an alert. If it’s really bad your dr would contact you. All of this any of course many other health related things is why their life expectancy was about 150 years.

16. Pictures. I seen hundreds of photos. Throughout the 900+ years. I seen based on multiple planets. I seen videos of inventions. Jet packs become more of a thing. But not for public use for travel. But used in many other ways. Around the time just before the events kick earth in its ass, a guy had something he made that allowed you levitate any object. I seen many many photos of space stations. Also something about a moon called Europe or Europas? They find bacterial life under its thick ice as well as fish-like life and squid looking life. That happens in about 12 years from now. 

17. Aliens. While I only seen in person the grey guy. I seen photos of life they found in the solar system. Mostly the fish like things I mentioned above. And while I didn’t see any photo of this, I do know that technology and knowledge is traded amongst different species. Mostly the grey guys kind. But there were names of others and news of trade deals. Something that sounded like (spelling may be off) Gurhah. Gerha . Something like that. In English it sounded like “gerrr-ha” like when a kid plays and makes monster growl. Guurrrrr. Gerrrr. I don’t remember how it was spelled. But we trade amongst them in around 2200s.

18. Time. One of the first things I asked about when they mentioned is fixing time, was what would happen to them? Would they just disappear etc? The answer was kind of scary. To me anyways. They said that nothing happens that they notice. That if they say, wish to ensure this war didn’t happen, they set it in motion and then send the person back. If he succeeds, the war never happened and they never even knew about sending someone back to prevent it. So for them, it’s all live updating every second but once something is eliminated it’s no longer in memory. I then asked that wouldn’t that mean that when they do the very last thing needed, that to them none of this ever happened and they never had to go back and fix things nor even know about doing it at all? They said yes. However, to solve this so they can keep record of it all and ensure that they don’t repeat mistakes, some of us who they brought there will return with a package. One that labels all the steps they’ve made. They are to plant the package in a certain place which they constantly would check. So imagine a box. Like in a bank vault where you keep your stuff. They would open that box and everyday some package was in it. But the box was just a box. It’s not linked to anything. The items just appear. Daily. It contains the log of what’s been accomplished even though now none of them have any memory of doing any of it. I asked what happens if they leave the box open, could we see the package just appear? They laughed and smiled. Then changed the subject. I felt as if that info was a need to know thing. I still wonder what would have happened and why they shrugged it off so casually. Make things clearer edit: there is only one timeline. Not multiple. There is no past or future, just now. When they wish to grab someone who used to exist, like me, they setup whatever it is they use (machines etc. never got to see what they use) to lock onto the target they wish to grab. The moment they press the button (so to speak) something like a wormhole with two ends begins to grab the target on one end and the target shows up through other. However, the second they start this process, and the target is grabbed, their time ceases to exist instantly. Then, time ticks on normal for the universe until it’s the year they launched the grab. For me 2956. But, the moment I’m grabbed, I instantly am in 2956, whereas the rest of the earth time ticks on normally for over 900 years. The moment 2956 comes, I then appear. They then have no knowledge of me but read through the package and it labels all they’ve done before. Since this is a new timeline, they have never met me or anyone else before me. Then they send me back and again time ceases for them but this time I’m to make changes. 900+ years go by and their memory of me is non existent except in the package notes. So they move to next target on and on. As I said above, when they get to their very last target that’s needed to fix everything, once they grab that person then send them back, again 900+ years will pass normally and they will never of had to do any of this. The only record will be their final package explaining what they have done and what not to do etc. think of it this way...say you’re working there just like my previous example. Today is your first day. Year 2956. You suddenly get t a package and it says YOU reset time 27 times and stopped x things from happening. You announce it to your superiors and move to whatever is the next thing you have to do unrelated. But now earth is in better shape than ever and nothing bad happened. It’s confusing I know but I’ll soon get help to draw some things on paper for a visual example. 

19. My name on Reddit. DontThrowAwayMyTruth came from the guy typing all this for me. He thought it meant something. He’s a weird sum bitch sometimes. Yes I’m making him type all this. 
(I’ll break your hip ye old bastard -TheGuy)

20. After spending hours looking online using diff keywords, trying to find an image similar to the clothing they wore in 2956, I found [THIS](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/799/303/large/alexey-zaryuta-suits.jpg?1452899650) just take the dark gray and make it white. Add some blue to belt area and the such. Also minus the head gear. They also had random boxes attached. Like on the sides of legs like army pants. On hip and sides of arms. They would keep stuff in these boxes. The casual clothing looked like [THIS](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/68/b4/75/68b4752b3edef0d32097e5de1883aa7a.jpg) only different colors. But the design was similar. Even men wore tight clothes like this with similar designs and colors. But pants.

21. I remember talking about space discoveries with a gentleman named Troy who was from that same year (2956) and he spoke of something called “Boots void” which was a section in space where there seemed to be no stars. He said that it was confirmed to be something like a dark matter / anti matter black hole. One had exploded billions of years ago and as it echoed out into space, would cause whatever Star it hit to eventually convert to an anti matter state and then explode, again echoing out deeper and hitting another and another and another. Causing a chain reaction of explosions wiping out many stars and was still doing so in that year. He said it would take 10s of billions of years before it got anywhere near earth. Was fascinating none the less. Fast forward to the mid 1980s and my friend told me of something that was discovered called “Boötes void” and it sounded similar to what I had mentioned. Fascinating to think about and scary as well.

22. The earths population will be around 15 billion people by 2080s and will peak. Laws will be out in place in some lands but mostly education and opportunity is what settled overpopulation down.

23. As for multiple timelines, they said there are none. Just this one. If I went back and killed my mother before having me, then the timeline updates to that moment and you now have a dead mom and a future me standing there who goes on living. Now you ask but if she’s dead before I existed then how did I grow up to be taken in the first place, and how was I able to come back to kill her? It would be a paradox. But the answer is no. They said it seemed that the universe doesn’t allow paradoxes. Instead what happens is time updates to that very moment. 
This explains the Mandela Effect as well. When time updates, it doesn’t happen instantly. So for a period of time you have two conflicting memories. And it takes a long time to update fully across the whole universe. 

This has happened only once before me. About 80 years ago from a future time. A young man was sent to stop the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. He tried multiple ways but failed. He was young. When that timeline played out it turned out that Lincoln had to be killed so they let it be. This caused that ripple in time where the Mandela Effect happened for the first time ever. Now it’s my turn. But paradoxes aren’t allowed in the universe and they are explainable. Time updates to the moment of intersection.

24. 90% of the things I seen and read about made no sense to me until after I returned and the years passed. Take aids for example. Reading about it in my time, 1975, I had no clue what it was. I read some stuff in it while there but until the 80s, 90s etc finally came after I returned, it then started to make sense. I would check my diary when I seen new technology or events happening. Then at that point I went through it with all of the world. But reading about certain events and things many years before they were to happen just made me log notes about the ones that stood out to me. Me today, of course am aware of them just as you are.

25. A question I keep he trying in messages sent to me is if time travel is public. Or for public use. 
The answer is yes it’s public as in everyone knows about it over the few hundred years, but no it’s not for citizens. Editing the timeline is dangerous. Also it requires a heap of energy stolen from the small black whole outside of our solar system. So not everyone is able to do this. They use it purely for editing time. Now for those saying that they would use it for bad....I don’t know. I was only where I was and could only see what I was allowed to see.

26. They let you keep a diary of information you can’t speak of? No. I began the diary after I returned. This is why it’s hard to name specific things like exact years etc. because 3 months of me reading and learning was just in my head. So by the time I came back I had to try and recall as much as I could. The general information wasn’t hard but things like exact dates were.

27. Dinosaurs. In 2035 scientists in South Korea successfully bring the T-Rex back using its descendants of today, chickens, DNA. The news images i seen of the creature was a very tiny raptor looking creature. brachiosaurus was next on this list but took another several years to produce results from it.

28. Trumps space force is the beginning of these discoveries that will take place in the next 5 and 10 years. I just seen news of more talk about his space force so I thought I’d chime in. I have a good 4 or so pages written up about this very thing that I’ll save for when I release them. 

29. In total, we’ve counted a good 1000ish topics from my diary. So I apologize to anyone who thinks I should have talked about x instead of y. When we made this post I didn’t count on a 100% reveal. So I mentioned the things I mentioned just in passing. At random. Of course there is more things that are greater than some. But there is a LOT so I intentionally am waiting to post those topics with my diary release vs typing all of it here and wasting my own time.

30. A few of you have messaged me about more information regarding the Big Bang discovery. While my pages talk in more detail about it, some things I’m hesitant on mentioning. This discovery alters our world view. It causes mass suicides in the religious areas and others. So for that reason I feel hesitant on saying specifics about what was discovered. All I’ll say is it is “colossal”. If anyone guesses what it is to the T I’ll admit to it. The little bit of light that escaped from this gave us enough to be able to take images. The images the world is presented with is shocking. Nightmareish. If you’re someone who excepts that things in the universe or other universes or even other dimensions would obviously look different than what we expect, you would likely be ok with learning this. But if your worldview is locked tight and if anything shows that your worldview is wrong, would cause you trouble, then it’s not something you’ll wish to know. I’m on the fence about revealing this in detail. So it may or may not happen. Edit: the light that came from this place traveled through the Big Bang shortly after it happened. Echoing out into our universe since the beginning of it. But it’s only seeable through a specific new technique that’s discovered. This is how we are able to see what’s on the other side of the bang. When the universe got to a certain size, I read that THAT is when the light traveling from this place into our universe was clearer. The first light would have been jumbled up but as things cooled in our universe, more light was able to pass through and into our universe. This discovery gives a front row seat as to what’s before the Big Bang and the place our universe sits in. Scary but amazing. 

31. Some of you asked about races. Most of what I seen was Asian and mixed. I seen nearly every race but the majority was Asian and mixed. (Black and white etc) some asked if humans evolved differently. No. Even 1000 years isn’t enough time to evolve. Everyone looked as they do today.

32. Another random entry from my diary. 4 red dots spaced apart equally on the top of your hand is from you being a previous “test” traveler. It means you’ve been there and was sent back after and will either be chosen in the future if needed or not and left alone. The dots on the hand, which I also had received, were from the injection they gave me BEFORE entering the building. They said it was no different then when a person in our time today gets shots to travel to other countries. It helps prevent you from spreading disease. In this case though, it wasn’t to stop them from getting any diseases from me, it was to stop me from getting any kind of sickness from the world around me as I stayed in 2956. So if you have these 4 dots, it means you went through what I did. Only your participation in editing time/the plan will be different.

33. As I read through their public database, I seen news of newspaper being digital. Happened around 2030-2040s. People could get a physical newspaper and it was thin as paper. Had video playing on it. Was touch capable like a phone. They could scroll through articles. Flip the page. (It was only one page folded.)

34. I just want everyone to know that all I’m saying becomes the norm in our future. Right now it all seems fantastical but if we go back 100 years and tell them we hold the worlds knowledge in our pockets in 2020, they too would see that as extreme and science fiction. Me saying we control a black hole or saying that there is something crazy on the other side of the Big Bang, may seem a little out there to you right now. But give it a few decades and these things become the norm. A few hundred years and things like controlling black holes becomes 3rd grade education...so to speak. 
Someone suggested that I eventually take one of my pages and let others study it. To confirm it’s age etc. that I have no problem with. If it helps bring some comfort then I’ll do it.

35. More info about the greys?

I tried searching info about them in their public database but only would ever find news of abductions etc. it seemed as if over the 1000 years, those grey guys worked secretly with the worlds governments. Now, in the year I went the grey dude was out and about. Everyone could see him. So after these catastrophes knocked the world for a loop, they became public knowledge.

From chatting with a couple people who were there, as I had a ton of questions about the little guy, I was met with a somewhat limited set of answers. Which made me think that most was a need-to-know basis type of thing. Mostly on questions about WHY are they here etc. but as for how long they’ve been here, one guy told me they have been here for 10s of thousands of years.

The only thing I know about their biology is they are hybrids. Part bio part machine. They are believed to be the FIRST set of intelligent life forms to happen in the universe. At least in the Milky Way. And he said that is why they look like they do. 

One guy here in Reddit made the point of why must everyone say aliens are humanoids? Two arms, two legs and upright like humans. When they should look completely different etc. we will soon discover that in evolution and natural selection, the humanoid shape is the best shape for life. Even if you were a big, and enough time had passed, you too would begin to evolve upright. Your front two legs would become arms and back becomes legs. I was told think of it like a bubble. ROUND is a natural shape in the universe. In space it’s because gravity is even. So things pack into round shapes. Planets, stars, black holes etc. 
In nature, like a bubble that settles into its most optimized shape, so does evolution paths. Most intelligent species do in fact look humanoid because of this. Evolution naturally favors this upright position and two armed two legged symmetry. It’s the most optimized way to be. 

Also, the grey guys are very child like. The times I seen this one, as the humans were speaking, I would stare at him. He would sometimes see me looking and then, like a child, Rick behind the commander. Peeking slightly around and looking at me. I would at other times see him staring at the kids playing kick ball. Sometimes when just standing there he would sway his arms back and forth. Restless like a child. However, he was stronger than he appeared to be. One time as the commander and the grey dude walked away, someone called over to the commander and both of them looked left at who called, causing the grey guy to walk into a super heavy metal desk. It just moved out of his way like it weighed less than paper. He walked through it instead of bumping it. It took 3 guys to push it back.


36. Some more information I gathered about time, based off some of your questions:
Someone messaged me asking if they can edit time, wouldn’t that mean that other advanced species out in the universe wouldn’t like it due to it also editing their time? Undoing maybe some of their accomplishments?
No. It requires a billion times more energy than what we had to do that. To edit all of the universe. When they do an edit, it does echo out into the galaxy but not far. If you were outside of that area looking in at earth, you would just see it jumping through time. So say an asteroid hits earth and we edit time to undo that. If you were outside of this limit, you would see the asteroid hit...then you’d see the earth instantly be repaired however long after. A better visual example would be if our sun exploded and you’re outside the limit, you would see the explosion...then suddenly the sun is back to normal. Not rewinds back, just instantly. As if skipping scenes in a movie. If you are within the limit then your time gets edited as well. So to avoid this, other species are aware of when an edit will happen so they have time to leave and get to a safe distance. How far? I do not know. 
In order to edit further out I was told they would need more energy than they can get their hands on.

37. Someone messaged me asking more info on a comment where I said white holes are discovered. The science on this is beyond me but the best way I can describe how it was discovered is time. When they take someone from the past and move them to the future, that person isn’t technically traveling forward in time instantly. They remain inside the worm whole for 900 years (for me anyway) as time outside the wormhole ticks normally, the person inside would look frozen in time to them. 900 years ticks by and the frozen in time person comes out. Having instantly traveled from their perspective. Well, this was how white wholes were discovered. Sending someone back into the past the same way, you’re technically traveling through the wormhole faster than light moves. White holes are just black holes that operate backwards in time. This was first spotted when some of their scientists did test runs to the past and could observer the small black hole that’s orbiting our system. It instantly turned white. Because it was operating backwards in time and not forwards. As for white holes naturally in the universe, I have no clue. I can only speak of this one. Basically all black holes are white holes but the catch is that in order for a black hole to become a white whole is if time itself surrounding the black hole begins to tick backwards."
117,Memory from when I was a teenager,Abductions,17,"I've been thinking a lot about an experience I had when I was a teenager lately. I've never really told this story to anyone. I just discovered this subreddit last night and after reading about several people's experiences I decided to share mine.

This happened when I was in high school. I was probably around 16 years old. I lived in a small, rural town in Utah with my mom. I'm the youngest of my siblings and was the only child living at home at that time. My mom was a single mother and often worked long hours to make ends meet.

One evening I had just climbed into bed to go to sleep. My bedroom was in the basement of the house and didn't have any windows. There was a family room across the hall from my bedroom with a large window that faced our backyard. If I left my bedroom door open, I could see straight out this window while I was in bed.

Occasionally while I was in bed, I would look out the window and I would see really bright lights that would sort of move from left to right. At first I thought that these lights were coming from cars, but the more I thought about it, it didn't make any sense. Our house was in a pretty heavily wooded area and surrounded by trees on 3 sides. There weren't any roads nearby on that side of the house and the lights seemed too bright and too close to be coming from a car.

One night I was having a hard time sleeping and was staring out the window when I saw the lights. It freaked me out more than normal this time as I couldn't think of any rational explanation for the lights. After I saw them flash by the window a few more times, I got really scared and started hiding under my covers.

After a few minutes, it got too hot, so I decided to peek out from the covers to see if the lights were gone. When I pulled them off of me, I saw my mom standing in the doorway of my bedroom, looking at me. She said something like ""It's ok, sweetie.""

I was kind of confused after she said that. Normally she would go to bed pretty early since she often had to go to work before I would leave for school. It was probably around 11:30 or midnight when this happened, so I was confused about why she was up. I looked at her again and noticed that she looked different. She seemed much longer than normal; her head nearly touched the top of the doorway. Suddenly the bright lights appeared behind her and sort of illuminated her. Her face was all distorted and she didn't look normal.

I was really scared at this point. Before I could react, she vanished and 3 beings appeared where she stood. They glided toward me and pinned me to the bed. I remember feeling these incredibly strong hands pressing down on my arms and legs and my throat. I tried to scream, but before I could get any noise out, they stuffed something into my mouth that went back into my throat. I couldn't breathe. All I could do was thrash and squirm as they held me down.

Suddenly my room got brighter and brighter until it hurt to keep my eyes open. It was like looking at the sun. I never got a good look at the beings that were in my room holding me down. I just remember closing my eyes and struggling to breath, thinking that I was going to die.

And just like that, it was all over. I was suddenly back in my bed and it was morning. I looked at my alarm clock and saw that it was after 7. I could hear my mom upstairs getting ready. I just remember being really scared and unable to move. After a few minutes, I heard my mom yell from upstairs telling me to get up. I tried to respond but it was like my brain was disconnected from my mouth and I couldn't talk.

After a few minutes of lying in bed, my brain sort of ""reconnected"" to my body and I could move again. I then realized I was naked. I usually wore some gym shorts and a t-shirt to bed, so this was unusual. I tried to roll out of bed, but couldn't. I felt an intense pain in my stomach and groin, so I just stayed in bed and started to cry. A few minutes later my mom came downstairs to see why I was still in bed. She seemed kind of mad at first, but then saw that I was crying. I said I didn't feel well. My voice was all raspy and it hurt to talk. She felt my forehead and said I was warm. She said I could stay home from school if I wanted. I nodded yes and then she said she had to leave soon and would call me on her break. She went back upstairs and left a few minutes later.

I tried getting off of my bed, but my stomach hurt so bad that it was agony to even move. After a few minutes, I managed to climb out of bed and spotted my clothes from the night before in a pile on my floor. I hobbled over and picked them up. They felt really warm and smelled strange, kind of like a burnt, metallic smell.

All of the sudden I felt really ill and went to the bathroom. I threw up in the toilet a ton of clear liquid, and some of my dinner from the night before. There was also this weird dark, gray metallic object in the toilet that I had thrown up. It was shaped like a cylinder and about the size of a tic tac. I had no idea what it was. I wish I would have scooped it out, but I decided to just flush the toilet.

After about 30 minutes or so, my body felt normal again, but I was still confused and frightened about what had happened that night. I pretty much just stayed in bed that whole day. I eventually went to sleep and stayed asleep for most of the day. My mom called several times, but I didn't hear the phone. She ended up coming home from work early to check on me.

From that day on, I never saw the lights outside the window again. I still have no idea what happened or if it was all a dream, but it freaks me out to think about it. Sorry for the long post, but it feels good to finally tell someone about this."
118,Alien abductions,Abductions,28,"I figured id post here to tell you my story.

I was in elementry school in the 90s or maybe it was middle school.. 

Reguardless

I was asleep on the couch in the living room one night and I felt a tap tap on my left shoulder.

I turn to see a blurry figure standing there.. not one but 2.  They were long, slender and grey wearing metalic like suits.

They had no ears or a mouth that I could see.  

I just remeber being scared and I turned back around to go to sleep.

The next thing I remeber was a more forceble tap on my shoulder forcing me back around.  I had no choice but to open my eyes.

I put my glasses on to see the 2 slender aliens looking at me.

I coudnt hear them but yet I COULD hear them..more like telepathy idk..

They wanted me to go with them.. i said... i called out for my parents but no one responded.  It was as if time just stopped.

I said let me get changed first.  The followed me downstairs.... i dont remeber much of getting changed but I did bring a cd of pop music with me.


My next scene was on the space craft.  

I was looking into space..

Controll room with others like them.

Metalic and very futuristic with a long control panel.  I said here... gave them my cd and they popped it in to play it only for me to hear a loud screaching noise.. they  forcefully gave it back to me... i guess rhey didnt like it.

I remeber my hair was a mess... and I asked a billion questions.. whats this?  Where are we going?  Who are you?  Ect...

We passed every planet till we flew to the back side of mars.


I dont remeber the landing but I do remember seeing a hanger with other ships just like the one I was on and other aliens... about like walking down a city street crowded.

One on my left one on my right..

The building or hanger was shiny.

Two big pillars like all metalic and rectagle stood a each side of the hanger with other ships.

The floors were metalic like as well.

The nexy thing I heard was you will soon become one of us.

I remeber telling them that I dont wanna be one of you.. I wanna go home.

The next thing I remeber was waking up in my parents bedroom in there bed.  I remeber saying Mom?  She said yes?  But I coudnt move my body or my mouth.  I was in some sort of peralises mode.

I told her about i coudnt move.  She said only old people get that.  Your too young to of gotten that.


That was the first abduction

The second time was MANY years later.

We were driving home from dinner and I happened to look up and saw weird lights following me.  I had the feeling I shoudnt of looked so I didnt.

We got home.  By now I sleep downstairs in my room. 

It was semi late at night.  I was awaken by a light shining through my window.  I saw this thing hovering and peering through at me.  It saw me and floated away.

I remeber hearing a humming noise.  I had this strange feeling.  I go and lock my door.  As soon as I did.. only 2 to 3 min later.. it rattled.  I opened my window and crawed out.  I remsmber running to my neighbors house and knocking on the door.  No one answered.  And I ran to my other neighbors... that all I remeber..  I woke up in my laun. Room on the floor with loss of time.. I didnt remember anything but had this fear of looking at the night sky as they were watching me


And my final obduction..

I just remeber hearing that humming noise from my room..  I again locked my door... i tried to hide in my closet.. then under my bed.. when they were not looking I ran... I called for my parents but no one could hear me.. i unlocked the front door, closing it from behind and hid in my parents Mercury Grand Marque.... I was scared.. the last thing I remeber was they found me looking through the back seet window left side.. i said please dont take me.. please no.. and I woke up outside the house in a different car.. 

I remeber getting up and going back inside... esely in the am.... not remebering how I ended up there.  

I know my storys are long but I was wondering if anyone else had abduction stories sim to mine.. im at that point in my life im not afraid to talk about it.

I did report to mufon a while back but they coudnt find snt reports of ufo activity in the area at that time.  Perhaps I got the year and month wrong?  I dont know.

I wanna know others who may have experienced what I have.. I dont wanna feel alone and being told its all a dream.. you made it all up.


UPDATE:

I also wanted to mention one thing I didnt mention before.  

Iv noticed whenever I talk about this in person to someone, I get weird feelings of being watched or I end up with vivid weird dreams. 

One occassion happened 2 weekends ago on a Saturday.  I mentioned it to someone and i also yelled im not afraid anymore... and spoke out in the open about it as if they could hear me.

I went to sleep.

I had a weird dream..

All I can remeber was waking up to that same forceful touch I felt all those years ago.. I was sweating... 

I didnt sleep that night."

125,Psychedelics and abduction,Abductions,24,"

Less than a year ago I had an experience with what seemed to be extraterrestrials. I was under the influence of a high dose of mushrooms and a high dose of ketamine around the time that the experience happened, but the strange thing is that I cannot place exactly when it happened because it seemed to happen outside of time itself. I'm not saying that this was 100% a genuine alien abduction experience, but the experience was certainly more than the effects of the drugs. 

The trip itself was done for spiritual/exploratory purposes. I wasn't just getting high. It was done alone in silent darkness (McKenna style plus ketamine). At the peak of the mushroom trip I insufflated enough ketamine for a k-hole experience. I'm experienced with both mushrooms and ketamine, but what happened was outside the realm of anything I had ever experienced on either of those substances. 

It began like I expected (lights, colors, sounds, the sensation of motion and the experience of being somewhere unfamiliar.) I met the typical psychedelic entities (much like those on dmt). But then there's a huge gap where I don't know what happened. I remember coming out of the room once the ketamine had worn off and the peak was over. I was laughing hysterically at existence itself and was overcome with the typical feeling of cosmic consciousness/one with the universe/whatever you want to call it. 

But then when I woke up the next morning, the memory of the extraterrestrial experience flooded my mind. I remembered that sometime during the trip everything went black. I woke up on a table in a white room. There were no more trippy visuals. My ego was completely intact and I felt completely like myself. I realized that I was unable to move very much, as if I was strapped to the table. I looked up and there were three creatures above me, looking down at me.

They were tall and slim. Their skin was almost transparent and a light gray color. They had large black eyes and no nose or mouth. I started freaking out and trying to break free. I remember having the particular sensation of being an animal under the microscope of a much more powerful being. I was terrified. Then, immediately, the creatures communicated with me telepathically. They told me to calm down. They said that they weren't going to hurt me, but that they were just curious. I was suddenly calm and really sleepy. I felt warm and numb, almost as if I had been drugged or anesthetized. Then everything went black. 

I didn't remember this until the next morning, but I know that it happened sometime during the trip. The strange thing is that it felt like it happened outside of time. I can't place exactly when it happened or how long it took. The experience really shook me up. I kind of blew it off as the effects of the drugs, but over the months since it happened, I can't get it out of my head. I've read many abduction stories since then and it's so similar to many I've read. I've also read what Carl Jung writes about alien experiences. 

Whether the experience was actual aliens or a projection of something within myself that i perceive as being so foreign that I have to project it onto an alien experience, I can't say for sure. All I know is that I want to learn more about the experience. I want to contact whatever this was that I encountered. Of course, I want it to be real aliens because that is fucking awesome but if it's something psychological than I'm just as interested. I honestly don't think that the two are mutually exclusive, but who knows. 

I wonder if anyone here has had any similar experiences or know of any good resources for learning more about these phenomenon. There are so many shitty alien websites. I want to contact these entities again just out of curiosity. I also want to be sure to be really grounded before I do any of this because this stuff definitely has the potential to mess with my perception of reality if I take it too far. 

Thanks everyone"

127,getting used to it,Abductions,2,"Recently after years of reading up on alien life it has dawned on my that there are many many alien races.  I feel confident in this by means of the testimonies of astronauts and other scientists and thinkers.  Once you get used to that idea then you can accept these 'people' just like we would accept other races here on earth.  Then it loses most of its wonder and awe.  Like wtf, the universe is a huge place so why should there not be others out there.  They won't look like humans maybe but still. . . As some have said we all have the same core existence of consciousness and so we are all one in the larger sense.  That dampens a lot of the fear.  But... still just like in real life there are those who are not so nice and who would hurt us if they could.  To me it seems okay to desire contact with these exterrestrials but at the same time it's wise to invoke protection by means of affirmations, prayers etc.  Like if these aliens can come into your home and just take you and you have no means of stopping them-well that leave us with the what ya gonna do to stop it?   These beings may have been here since the birth of mankind so in the largest sense what they are doing may not be a bad thing, just that in the process the abducted person can endure suffering."
128,My experiences with abduction,Abductions,20,"I thought about posting on a throwaway, but I don't really care. So, my first encounter happened when I was around 6 or 7. I was living with my grandparents at the time, I remember running into their room late at night because I had a nightmare. They set up a small cot next to their bed and I fell back asleep. I was woken up by what I thought was rain splatting against the window, but then I saw shadows moving around and there was no rain. Suddenly I was aware of ""people"" outside my grandparents bedroom ""talking"". Their language was rythmic, It sounded like what I can only describe as a marching band, but clicky in a way. Then, nothing. 

A few years later and I was living with my mom. My brother at my dads. They took me so many times, it almost seems like my childhood is a blur, my memory is really spotty so forgive me if this isnt super detailed. I remember when I would stay at my dads, they would come very late at night and I would think, oh it's a train, only there were no trains nearby. One time, I showed up at my dads for my weekend visit and my brother told me that some men came into his room one night looking for me. Another time at my dads, I was just about to fall asleep when I became aware of someone in my room, the next  thing I know, it was like I fell into my bed and my mouth was bleeding a LOT.

I only had two experiences at my moms. The first, I was up late reading a book when I got the feeling I was being watched, I looked up and there was a small face staring at me through the cracked door. Next thing I know, It's morning. The second, I was really sick and I was sleeping in my moms bed, my brother was sleeping out in the living room. I remember hearing what sounded like two people walking around out there and my mom started freaking out, saying stuff like ""I wont let them take you"" I woke up the next day and I wasn't sick anymore.

Once I became an adult, the encounters stopped for a realllllly long time. Around 7 years ago, I was living with my girlfriend at the time. One week, while she was on a work trip out of state, I fell asleep on the couch in the living room. It was in the middle of summer so all the windows were open. I heard a loud noise outside, then lights. I assumed it was a car at the time and I thought to myself that it was my dad. Two problems with that. My house was in the middle of nowhere so it wouldnt have been a car and my dad lived in Arizona, about a 24 hour drive from there. I have no idea why my brain made the association that it was my dad. Then about a month later, gf and I are in bed, were both trying to sleep when all of a sudden, there is a huge flash of light and I caught a glimpse of two figures at the foot of the bed. The next morning, I ask her if she saw that and she said yes, she had seen the light, gotten scared and rolled over to wake me up but I was gone, she said she went out in the living room and I was nowhere to be found. Then she said she remembers thinking, ""oh hell be back"" then went back to sleep!! 

That's pretty much it for me, except for last night, I woke up a bunch due to nightmares, then around 4 am, I feel someone shaking me, I roll over and I see this small person with hair covering their face standing directly over me!! I panic and start screaming bloody murder! I was terrified, then I realize it's my roommates girlfriend. I was so embarrassed. Sorry for the long post!"

132,3/3 siblings abducted possibly for fucked up genetics,Abductions,7,"Last year I posted my possible abuction story with my youngest brother (Danny). Long story short, it was the scariest night of my life without seeing what we were up against. I felt it strengthened our sibling bond although I felt relieved at least one of us was spared.

While casually talking to my other [the spared] brother (Carl) about dreams, he said ""Hey remember that one time when we were young, I dreamed there were three kids in costume trying to corner me? It's so weird that it's so clear it feels like a memory."" I told him to describe the ""kids"" to us again, and as he did, his face started to twist into horror the same time as mine. His description was basically grey aliens and he just realized it after all these years!  He said there were three of them who have cornered him against the bedroom wall (one was holding a syringe). Somehow they were telling him to calm down because they just need a blood sample. So nope, no one was spared afterall.

That was how we got convinced 3/3 of us have most likely been abducted.

The other night, Carl texted me while I was at my girlfriend's. He was panicking because something was violently vibrating inside his leg. He said it was nothing like a spasm but more like a phone set in silent vibrating from a call. He said whatever it was felt tiny and couldn't be felt by his finger. He didn't tell Dan because he didn't want to scare him at midnight, being in the countryside practically alone with our grandma.

Just 3 hours after Carl's texts, Dan called me freaking out. He said something's vibrating inside his nape and described it exactly as Carl described his. 

There are also things that freak me out most likely related to our possible abduction:

-Our dad says since he was a kid he's been seeing blond people outside his window looking at him [he said they looked exactly like these](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTEX8s0hsePh-rOGicU8xxwLjMtFX0ht5eW5aLjO1mzKlLDmPvk). (Many reported abductees have ascendants or descendants who were observed as well. Maybe our dad's a subject too?)

-Our paternal side of genetics is FUCKED UP. My dad came from at least 3 generations of inbreeding. (Wealthy European family in a colonial country, so for wealth-preservation). My clan is plagued by ultra rare cancers, physical deformities, and even internal mutations so my theory is we're being studied for this.

-We've been seeing UFOs since we were kids. One time, we had a new pretty powerful camera and we successfully shot tons of photos and videos of them. By morning, they were gone from the camera! Like somebody snuck in our house to delete JUST those proofs.

-Carl and I have insane streetlight interference. Streetlights turn off when we walk under them. Even streetlights that have been dead for months will turn on only during the moment we walk under them.

-In Dan's case, transistor radios go static when he goes near them.

Our uncle is a radiologist so we asked him to xray us to look for implanted chips or capsules but he found nothing. We're afraid we will experience a worse abduction but honestly what can be done?"
133,Scary Encounter,Abductions,2,"I'll start by saying that maybe I'm crazy, but this was all so unbelievably real, it would be harder for me to prove it to be untrue.

I woke up in a golden or brass room. There was a giant ornate pillar in the center and metallic pedestal-like beds surrounding it. I was laying on one of the beds naked with my head pointing towards the pillar. There were a few others around me on other beds but I didn't recognize them.

There was an upper level of this room where dozens of observers were standing like in a surgery theater. 

They said they needed my blood and I asked if it would hurt, and they said that it would, very much so. 

I felt a pressure on my back where my solar plexus is, then heard a popping noise as a golden spike pressed into my back and I saw it push up against the skin of my stomach but it didn't pierce completely through. It was beyond painful but I couldn't move or scream.

It was happening to the others too but they didn't seem to react.

I woke up in my bed in a cold sweat and my back was cramping and in pain, but I had no marks anywhere on my body.

All in all, a terrifying and bizarre experience. It probably was a dream, but it just felt so real."

135,Hooded figure seen outside bedroom window,Abductions,16,"Any one else seen the hooded figures looking in window??  This happened before a bad experience

I climbed into bed and turned off the lamp laying on my right side with my back to the window, on the opposite side of the room was my dressing table that was facing the window , so i could actually see my bedroom window through the dressing table mirror,..well for a split second there was a hooded figure looking in the window. I jumped up and turned to look behind me and it had gone. husband was working nights and my children were all sleeping.i was petrified shaking and sweating at what i had seen...few months after that i had a terrible abduction experience..while my husband was laying at side of me in bed

That night we all went to bed around 9 iI lay there for a while watching the clock change and looking at the rain hitting the window.i don't remember everything but i know i couldn't move or scream and i was by then laying on my back my husband was just at side of me with staring eyes and mouth open.i could hear my heart beating in my ears and felt tremendous pain in my forehead while having a jelly like substance forced down my throat as i tried to scream, then i started moving towards my bedroom ceiling...thinking im gonna be crushed to death,but instead i went right through it.. next thing i know i was floating a few inches above the ground outside and could also feel the rain on my body..then started to rise up ..i must have passed out as i don't remember much after that.the next day  a friend said whats happened to your forehead?? i had a small bruise right in the centre of my forehead my husband never wants to speak about it and tries to laugh it off for weeks i felt ill and had head aches

This happened to me in 1994 and ever since that night i have been a vegetarian...and iv had other experiences since. Not something you would go tell your neighbour to be honest  there's been few unexplained things that il not go into just now ..but thanks for reading"

137,I've been abducted more than once.,Abductions,25,"To start off, some my abductions come in the form of dreams and some are awake. I've had countless dreams over my life with Alien's and UFO's. Below are the ones that I believe I made real contact:

* I saw Orion's belt in the distance (not the first time I've seen this in past dreams). I then saw a UFO drop from Orion's belt to below the horizon. I started to head towards my brother who was about 150 yards away from me to tell him what I saw. As I head over I start to float up. I start yelling at him to get his attention, yet he couldn't hear me. I next remember being paralyzed on my side. I can see the earth below me, the sun in the distance and this mind boggling huge UFO. I mean fucking massive!! I'm now inside the mother ship in the same paralyzed position as I was before. I'm in this huge poorly lit room, hard to describe. Near me in my vision is this blank screen. Then appearing on the screen was a few speaker looking things, black and red in color. It then went blank and came back as this crazy hexagon kaleidoscope type design, yellow and orange in color with numbers inside counting extremely fast. While laying there it truly felt as if I was there in the flesh. I was able to look around with my eyes, blink, but not move because I was scared to try. I kept thinking that I want to be back in my bed because fuck this shit. I heard this sound (hard to describe) and was transferred to my bed and in that same position in a sweat, awake. It was weird, I never woke up in my bed, I was just there. I couldn't fall back asleep.

* All I could see was complete white, and for some reason I can only think of is pi. I saw a weird spiral of numbers that kept on going forever. That came in and out of my visions a few times. The with that white background I saw a silhouette of a grey, they did something with my brain (it never hurt, it just felt mushy?). I heard odd breathing to my left, I jolted and woke in my bed.

* One grey was over top of me in my bed (he was blurry and I couldn't make out details) and he said to me everything will be alright. He disappeared then there were two more figures at the end of my bed, and they raced to the head side of my bed. All I can remember.

* I remember being in this floating thing inside one of their hallways. I couldn't see anything around me, I was just floating facing down and all I could see was the floor and two sets of legs on either side of me. Their legs were human like yet different, they were skinny and long. We stopped at a door way and that's all I can remember.

* I don't recall how I got into this position, but I was in an awake state floating over my bed rotating clockwise. Then I heard a voice in my head, sounded male and sort of robotic. He said something like 'I was picked a long time ago for this life, we have been watching over you ever since, and you are dong a good job.' I tried to talk back, I really wanted a name, who are they? But no sound was coming out. Only air was leaving my mouth. That's how I know I was awake, I could feel the air leave my mouth with saliva.

* I was sleeping on the couch. Again had that floating sensation, briefly this time. There was a dim light in the hallway towards the left of my vision. The grey was on my right, it was completely dark there, and I couldn't see him. He said hello, I said hello back (this blew my mind, I was able to talk back). Then he said a few things and all I can remember was something about ""you've been chosen 'Ho_Phat' or you are the chosen one 'Ho_phat,'"" he said my name!! I then reached out my hand and was able to grab a hold of his hand, he had longer and thicker than normal fingers, they felt smooth and just like skin. I was super excited and started to give him high fives hahah. I then waved and said goodbye and he said goodbye and left.

* I was in this really dark room, there was one white light by my feet. I saw a silhouette of a small grey to my lower right side. I saw his almond shaped eyes, the eyes were white. I was able to reach out my hand in front of me, the grey grabbed my hand and got super excited and started to go around me. My energy felt super charged, I kept saying I want to help Earth, it literally felt like my energy blanketed the Earth with love. Absolutely unreal experience, I'll never forget (I actually use this feeling when I meditate still). Next thing I know I got poked in my lower right ab area, near the belly button. I didn't like it and woke up. Oddly enough for weeks it felt sore there, but no marks.

* This one I was awake for. I felt a pressure push me to the bed, every inch of my body was being pushed down by a force. I started to freak out, close my eyes and sweat like crazy. I opened them and saw a Grey's mouth right beside my eyes trying to talk to me, but no sound came out. It seemed like there was some sort of blue force between him and me. I closed my eyes again, and he left a bit after that. I got out of bed and was freaking out... I couldn't sleep after that. I ended up falling asleep a later, woke up and I saw a tall grey standing in the corner of my room. I just rolled over and went to sleep like it was normal.

With all this I wanted to get answers, so me and a friend one night went out star gazing with the intention on seeing if we can get some sort of conclusion. The night was a clear, no clouds at all. The moon was full and bright. It was about 2330, my friend and I were both looking towards the moon. Then all of a sudden 3 lights appeared right beside the moon, forming an upside down triangle. These lights were a pure white, just as bright or slightly brighter than the moon. My friend and I were both gobsmacked at this sight, we couldn't take our eyes off this. About 5 seconds later the top 2 lights faded out quite quickly, the bottom light stayed lit till the top 2 were gone. Then the bottom light slowly moved up in a squiggly line leaving a very faint light trail while fading away.

I'm not really sure what to say. I know they are here, I get the feeling I am being looked after. They have actually been a positive influence on my life here. I hope this helps others."
138,I think I was abducted once,Abductions,7," 

It's kind of a long story, but one night I went to bed and after falling asleep I entered into the most surreal dream I have ever had.

My dream started off as I was descending from the Sky onto another planet entirely, I definitely was not on Earth anymore, and I found myself in this super futuristic looking glass city. The only thing I have ever seen that resembles this cities buildings is this: [https://www.google.com/search?q=worlds+largest+buildings&rlz=1C1CHBF\_enUS845US845&hl=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjUvLPsouPnAhXSop4KHQRAC7sQ\_AUoAXoECA8QAw&biw=1743&bih=719#imgrc=dUqy0N-n25jCpM](https://www.google.com/search?q=worlds+largest+buildings&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS845US845&hl=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjUvLPsouPnAhXSop4KHQRAC7sQ_AUoAXoECA8QAw&biw=1743&bih=719#imgrc=dUqy0N-n25jCpM)

As I was hovering over the city, I saw that the city was surrounded by luscious green trees and vegetation, but not like the trees we have on Earth, everything was so green, vibrant and alive. I was taken down to the people and they all were wearing these super futuristic looking clothes with purple hues and and robes.. they didn't look like robes per say, they kind of looked like what Royal people would wear just more slim fitting and attractive looking. They had these types of devices with them that would allow them to all be interconnected and up to date on what everyone else was doing.. it was like they had a hive-mind conscience and everyone was connected.

They were all super intelligent and the things I was looking at were wayyy beyond my human comprehension.. I could try to explain what I saw but it would be like a person from 300 years ago trying to describe what a microwave was doing.. it makes no sense. They had this thing implanted on the top of mountainside away from the city that looked like it was drilling into the mountain (No idea what this was.) They pathways they walked in were illuminated.. kind of like it had a glow to it, or energy. Everything was made out of glass and crystals and this kind of mesh that kept it together strongly.

After viewing the city and such, I was sucked back into a craft and we shot away form this planet. I then found myself hovering above london in the UFO. I remember thinking in my dream, that the people down there have no idea that we exist in this craft above them.. and I found it awe inspiring that I could watch remotely from above without anyone noticing me. Then the UFO beamed me towards Earth and I shot back into my body and woke up.

Has anyone experienced something like this? Where they are taken somewhere else and get dropped back off? All in all, whether it was a dream, or some form of mental experience, It was very fluid, fun, and energizing.

I didn't get anally probed though :/"

We are taught to quote movies, television shows, radio personalities, to link our thoughts with an article written by another person, and to run to a search engine when we are unsure. Spell check is the only thing that keeps us from barely knowing how to write. I just used it 10 times. We need a place where we can shed recycled thought and mass-produced opinion. Does anywhere on Reddit already resemble this? I need a place where humans prove that we can organically communicate, even in electronic form."

Hello again,

I posted last month about some missing time and seeing a grey in November. I made a very crude sketch at the time but had several free hours this weekend, so I made a detailed 3D model of the alien I saw using a digital sculpting app.

I am >90% confident that I've accurately reproduced what I saw, the only part I really struggled with is exactly how the frontal bone/orbital socket area works with their weird eyes. I am an amateur sculptor so I guess I'm lucky that I am familiar enough with bone structure to give it my best guess, but the eyes are so strange. Still, the results are very, very, very close to what I saw.

Also, I channeled something again earlier this month that wanted to talk about greys, presumably because I was thinking about them so much. It's not exactly a warm-fuzzy conversation and I don't know what I think about it all yet, but it's there for anyone who cares to check it out.

I attempted to channel with this group over the weekend and they connected only long enough to reject the request, stating essentially that it wasn't a good time to talk. They stopped even saying that after I tried a few more times and they kept rejecting it, so idk. I might try again tonight if I'm not too tired after work.

Here are the links. Don't freak out about the URL, I have everything set to free/public. I just don't want to have all this content dependent on a Reddit account (my last account was banned by the admins with no explanation for reasons I couldn't figure out) and free blogging sites like Wordpress are full of ads, which I hate.

En mi recuerdo tengo alrededor de nueve años, en ese tiempo compartía habitación con mi hermano pequeño de cinco años de edad.

Era una habitación pequeña del típico fraccionamiento de infonavit. La única ventana de la habitación daba al pequeño porche al frente de la casa.

Despierto en la madrugada por la necesidad de ir a orinar, al abrir los ojos veo una luz intensa que entra por la ventana. Salgo de la habitación pensando en que después de orinar iría a buscar el porqué de ese destello que no bajaba su intensidad, pero pospuse el ir al baño porque me doy cuenta que la puerta de la casa está totalmente abierta, lugar por el que también entra bastante luz.

Me dirijo a la puerta para ver qué era lo que sucedía afuera mientras escucho un sonido extraño que proviente también del exterior a un volumen intenso, pero sin ensordecer totalmente mi oído, era un sonido que compararía con una turbina enorme,  una lavadora, o algo similar, como algo que gira, algo que se acerca y aleja constantemente.

Al llegar a la puerta veo al cielo y sin más, veo el típico platillo volador en forma de disco, tenía un tamaño considerablemente grande y estaba suspendido ridículamente cerca de mi casa, diría que a no más de 10 metros del techo. El disco se encontraba inclinado sobre mi casa como a 45 grados, es decir, había una parte de el muy cerca del suelo y el otro extremo apuntando al cielo, la parte de abajo daba justo hacía mi casa, y el sonido que había escuchado derrepente unos momentos atrás, lo hacían unos circulos de luz que giraban en la base alrededor del diámetro del disco. 

Cuando vi eso,  una única luz me cegó y lo próximo que recuerdo es que entro a la habitación de nuevo,  mí hermano está sentado en su cama tallando sus ojos y me pregunta: ¿A dónde fuiste?, a lo que respondo que fui a orinar. Me dice que no, porque él también despertó cuando me escuchó salir de la habitación, después de ""un rato"" y no escuchar que volviera, sintió miedo de estar solo y fue a buscarme al baño (como dije, él tenía cinco años de edad aproximadamente), cuando llegó al baño no me encontró allí y regresó a la habitación. Me dijo que acababa de entrar al cuarto y sentarse en su cama cuando entré casi detrás de él. 

Mientras mi hermano me cuenta que salió a buscarme, yo no recordaba nada acerca de las luces, ni la nave, yo me metía en mi cama de vuelta pensando que volvía del baño y que tal vez mi hermano acababa de despertar teniendo una pesadilla. Recuerdo finalmente asomarme por la ventana sin motivo aparente, y veo que el cielo estaba tornándose claro, estaba amaneciendo.

No sé con exactitud a que edad me invadió ese recuerdo por primera vez, pero siendo ya un adolescente fue que las imágenes de las luces y el disco llegaron a completar esta anécdota/sueño/recuerdo.

Eso es todo, he pensado mucho que tal vez fue un sueño, porque sí sueño de vez en cuando con lo mismo en la actualidad, pero recuerdo todo tan bien y exactamente igual estando despierto, haciendo cualquier actividad, que lo siento más como un recuerdo difuso de la infancia.

Hace unos años, le pregunté a mi hermano si recordaba algo más de esa noche (dándo por hecho, sin sentido, que él lo recordaría igual de claro que yo, me refiero al orden de los hechos) pero ni siquiera recuerda haber despertado de pequelo y haber vivido aquello. 

En fin, solo quería compartirlo. No doy por hecho nada, ni intento convencer a nadie de nada. Solo compartirlo."

Looking for individuals and law enforcement to share their stories on camera for a new criminal docuseries series being produced by an Emmy award winning company.,Abductions,2,"Hello Everybody..

I am in search for some **real-life, personal accounts for on-camera interviews** for a criminal docuseries series being produced by an Emmy award winning company.

If you or someone you know has experienced a situation that you’d be willing to talk about and/or would like your story told, we would love to interview you. We are also interested in speaking with those with a background in law enforcement, military, SWAT, self defense, survivalists, and others that may not have personally experienced these situations but are professionally trained to respond to them.

We are looking specifically for the following:

1). Someone who has had their child or a friend abducted in a car, and they know who took them. (If police could find the car, they would find the abductee)

2). Someone has gotten lost themself, or been looking for someone who has gotten lost/missing where the lost person didn’t have any cell phone signal. (Phone wasn’t dead, but out of range to contact anyone)

3). Someone who was going somewhere at night and was attacked out of the dark or concealment.

4). Someone who works at a business and had a disgruntled employee/agitated customer/or angry personal connection (like a partner that was just broken up with) show up at the business and cause violence. (The idea is that the person coming back was a “red flag” before they showed up and caused a disaster)

5) Someone who was put in a harrowing situation because they encountered someone who had a concealed gun.

6) Someone who was attacked, and their attacker had a prior violent arrest history

7). Someone was has been targeted by ant type of biological or chemical attack

8). Someone has gotten lost themself, or been looking for someone who has gotten lost/missing where helicopters were NOT used to help search, and if they had been, it would have helped. (Episode is about trying to use drones for search and rescue in areas that either don’t have the budget for helicopters, or getting a helicopter there from far away takes too long)

DM/Email me or comment below if you or someone you know might have a personal story they'd be willing and comfortable sharing. They would be communicating directly with myself. SF, LA & Las Vegas locals preferred but open to anyone in the continental United States. Requirments would be a few hours of the individuals time (\~2 hours). Supporting videos, photos and visual aid are a **major plus**. We are a bare bones crew and are able to come to you directly or at agreed upon location.

163,Megan Blewett Abduction File: Recorded 2/15-16/2017,Abductions,2,"Hello, this is a story of an old friend of mine and my experiences questioning her. I want to delete the document but don't want the information to be lost, so I am posting it here. I apologize for any grammatical errors.  


Megan has a reoccurring nightmare, total number of times is a handful. Last incident was after getting drunk at applebees. 

This dream causes her intense fear, and hurts her head to remember. As if needles were pressing into the area of her forehead between her eyebrows.

She seems to need alcohol to remember. 

This Is the dream she has, a repressed memory.

She is four years old and she sees a large, close glowing green light in the field near her house. She climbs out her window onto the roof and jumps down to the ground. 

She is in the field and there is an intense smell of alcohol, specifically beer (potentially why she is allergic and needs it to remember). Begins running home, when she runs into an invisible wall and stumbles backwards, as she puts out her arms falling backwards she does not hit the ground but instead gets pulled into the craft over her, the craft looks like a glowing green clam with no light source, just radiating light. She begins feeling intense pressure and heat squeezing her equally all over. Described as “so hot that sweat would evaporate”. 

Next thing she knows she her hair is being brushed out of the way as to lie her down on a very soft operating table. Surrounding her are Grey/blueish, opaque, fluid like creatures with long necks, in a brightly lit room. In this room there are two structural columns that seem to be steel but grown over like an abandoned city. In the back of the room there is a one of the creatures, never moving, only watching the operation. It makes her feel afraid of him. Their wastes seemed to be higher than the table she was on. She would not stop talking but seemed to understand was going on through mental updates but without hearing words. She hears a consistent clicking noise inside their bodies. They are like water, when they need a face they just form it around the neck column, when they need hands they form them like water forms a path when spilled. The atmosphere was if they were trying to calm her, and she felt calm. 

They bent and moved all her limbs, turning her head left and right. She recalls them touching her stomach at some point but is sure her chest and in between legs were not touched. On her left are there is a metal retracting cast. Her arm has the palm facing up and what appears to be forceps spreading her arm open. She remembers her left arm hurting a lot. 

At the end a smaller lumpy block entered the room, it barely being taller than the table. It moved like water but made the sound as if a centipede was walking. The noise drove her crazy, but it made rumbling internal noise instead of the clicking. IT did not make her feel at ease, but it came to her arm and made her arm not hurt. Then it pressed the area on her forehead between her eyebrows and next thing she knew she was back in her bed. 

Current Condition:

She says it feels like needles in pressing into the forehead, between eyebrows location on her head when she tries to remember, upon remembering she feels intense fear. Her eyes would stare off in the distance, mouth will tremble, and is unable to speak loudly. Had an instance of forgetting that she was unresponsive for 3 minutes during conversation. Has said that the fear she feels may be something they make her feel and not that she is actually scared. Is scared of me sharing this info, with fear that someone will come take her away.

She has a scar on her left arm in the location of the surgery. Has said that sometimes her freckles hurt. She says that when she presses it, she feels nothing underneath the skin. 

Session ended at 5:30AM at her location, phone call was hung up at some point after I fell asleep (She says she left the call going). She awoke at 10:30AM her time and in her rush she noticed her arm was bleeding in the same location (exact location, it is the scar just longer) of her freckles where they operated, she ran it under a faucet and put a Band-Aid on it. The image looks like a scratch but she describes it as a pain in the bones of that location. (they may have removed the implanted device after her recalling the abduction) This night she describes her dream as, “Mmm I had a really horrible dream where all I heard was just a nasty drone noise and some ticking.” These noises most likely were the drone noise of the craft of the box creature and the clicking of the long neck creatures. Upon questioning her if she remembered she is unable to recall a single detail of the discussion about the abduction but can clearly recall all other bits of our conversation (bits I used to distract her when she became overly fearful) 

Says her Ex (lives in the same house) woke up and went to work at 7AM. Says he felt unwell and has migraines currently. Which if he was involved means they did a rushed job between 5:00AM and 7:00AM. Call was dropped at 1:18 AM my time, thus 6:18 AM her time, I am naming this the time of the second abduction.

Upon showing her this recorded information, her head hurt in the same location, her eyes fluctuated, confirms that she does not remember saying it but says the info is familiar. She kept looking back at her scar baffled. Conversation afterwards especially the part discussing telling others made her very scared and she spaced out again looking fearful.

Describes wound on arm during and now the same, stinging. Says it doesn’t hurt the outside to touch. Had x-ray before for breaking arm and saw nothing there. 

Happened at night

Everywhere was light kind of green, comfiest bed in the world 

Up was a purple kind of uv color

\[Something else was in corner, it was next to him. He wasn’t scary it was whatever was next to him, she could see flicker like a black mask, might have been a weapon\]

They had active air bases near and she was always fascinated by them and she’d go out at night to go look at them, was not in room couldn’t have gotten out, she remembered that the room she thought she was in was her brothers, her bed was at front of house so she could not have gotten out of it, she couldn’t even reach door handles? Mom always made sure door was locked, mom would have known she was up due to creaky house, and they were all light sleepers. She still remembers being in the field and remembered needing to go home due to time. Was sure she was running but thought she was playing. Know she was having “fun”, it was dark, it was a clear night. Flowers on the left, right hand side tall crops she liked hiding in to pop out and scare people.

TL;DR:

\- Unintentional astral projection in mid-November. Saw gray alien. Pic below.

\- Missing the entire following Thursday.

\- The next week was Thanksgiving in the US, everything was normal.

\- Missing entire Thursday following Thanksgiving.

\- No more missing days after that second Thursday. First time this has ever happened to me.

\- In early December I started unintentionally channeling something. I got answers to some small questions about aliens but sessions were short.

\- After Christmas, I had free time to meditate. Almost immediately channeled something that provided nine pages of content on humans and aliens. Transcript below.

\----------------------------------

Longer version.

Interesting things started happening in mid-November. In this order:

**--)** Around November 18 (I didn't write down the exact date), I was extra tired and decided to take a nap before work. Almost immediately upon getting comfortable, the loud roar and vibrations that happen before astral projection started. This isn't unusual for me. I've trained myself not to resist (though I find this unpleasant) and usually, it happens in the same way -- I end up floating with my face a few inches under the ugly popcorn ceiling in my bedroom, where I let myself fall asleep and wake up in my body like usual.

During this nap, I felt myself separate and elevate, the noise and vibrations were replaced by the stillness of being out of the body, and I felt myself stop moving. I assumed I was under the ceiling and opened my eyes expecting to see a face full of popcorn ceiling. Instead, I was surrounded by black with what appeared to be an array of bright white lights like LEDs arranged in a long rectangular grid above me. It was impossible to tell how far away the lights were.

This has never happened to be me before, ever, that I can remember. I've never seen anything like it. I didn't feel afraid, but I was very confused. I looked at the lights for a bit and then looked around. When I was looking down the left side of the light array, I noticed movement on the other side and looked back to see a scowling gray alien face had appeared and was staring at me. This is the first time, to my memory, that I have ever seen one of these beings.

It looked like the drawings, but its cranium was a bit wider at the top and it looked kind of old with creases and a weathered look to its face. It had large black eyes and stared at me without moving. I stared at it. I didn't feel afraid -- I didn't feel anything. But I was surprised in the sense of not expecting this. I didn't look away because I didn't know what was happening. It just stared at me. Then a very clear and strong idea entered my mind: ""I don't want to see this. I will go to sleep now."" I repeated this to myself as the exact same thought played in my head again.

I closed my eyes and the next thing I knew, I was on my bed shortly before my alarm was set to go off. Nothing was unusual or out of place and I physically felt fine. I never at any point felt like I had been asleep.

Here is a crude sketch I did to show what I saw while out of body: [https://ibb.co/Y3TKwqF](https://ibb.co/Y3TKwqF)

\---------------------------

**--)** Thursday, November 21, 2019, was normal as far as I can tell. But something strange happened. I woke up on Thursday like normal, got dressed, showered, got my coffee, went to work, settled into my desk, and then checked the calendar to see what was scheduled and was stunned to discover that it was actually Friday.

Now, let me explain. Every so often in the past I've lost track of the days in my mind for a moment and would be like, ""Oh, haha, right it's Tuesday, duh, I had a brain fart."" I'm sure we've all experienced this at some point.

This lost Thursday was NOT like that. I cannot even explain how I felt, it was like the floor had been ripped out from under me. This wasn't momentarily losing track of the day -- I had a complete sense of time and every cell in my body believed it was Thursday morning. The discombobulated feeling from the actual day not matching the day my body felt it should be made me feel sick. I got sheets of goosebumps from it. My memories from Thursday were still there (I checked the previous day's text messages and remembered sending them), but it was like an entire day-sized chunk of time itself had been perfectly erased from not just my brain, but also my body.

I convinced myself that I must have mistakenly thought it was Thursday, even though I didn't believe it. But every time during that day when I glanced at the calendar, I'd get nauseous and have goosebumps all over again. It took around 48 hours for the disoriented, discombobulated feeling to go away and for my body clock to feel like it was synced back with the right time again. It was such a bizarre, uncomfortable feeling.

\- The next Thursday after this was Thanksgiving in the US. I stayed with relatives and had already forgotten about the missing Thursday from last week. Nothing weird happened. I returned home on Sunday and everything was normal. I wasn't even thinking about the stuff from the week before.

\- On Thursday, December 5, 2019, it happened again. I woke up, went about my normal routine knowing it was Thursday, thinking about what I was going to do on Friday night, only to fire up my work calendar and see that it was already Friday. When this happened, I basically lost my shit. I almost threw up. Not even from fear, but from the overwhelming sense of reality itself fracturing and the complete incongruity between my internal sense of time and it being out of sync with actual time. The fact that it happened on the same day of the week but conveniently skipped the holiday felt almost like being teased.

\-----------------------------------

Over the next ten or so days following this experience, I found myself randomly linking with some other being or intelligence in what was essentially channeling. This is something that used to happen to me when I was young but hadn't happened to any substantial degree for many years. It was as if my body had some internal battery that had been recharged and I was fully back online for the first time in a long time.

The presence never felt threatening at all, but I was busy with the holidays and work and didn't have the inclination to sit down and entertain the presence for a proper session. I did, however, at times ask it some questions before bed and I got some responses. Here are some things I asked that you guys may be interested in:

**Question**: How many intelligent species exist in our galaxy that have equal to or greater than intelligence compared to humans?

**Answer**: 7,248,492

Note: When it said that, I thought to myself, ""Hah! That's obviously bullshit, come on now, that's an astronomical number."" Until I Googled how many planets are located in the Milky Way. Estimation: 100 billion to 400 billion. I can't even wrap my head around that number, it's so big. From what I read, it is estimated there are tens of billions of planets that may be able to support life. Seven million is a minuscule percentage of tens of billions and practically nothing compared to hundreds of billions. So I guess the number isn't so comically massive after all. Though I still take it with a huge grain of salt.

**Question:** How many intelligent species have visited Earth, including ones that are no longer here and ones that may still be here?

**Answer:** 84.

**Question:** Why don't they just announce themselves and stop with the obfuscation?

**Answer:** People cannot know. They will be afraid. Too hard for them to understand.

I had asked some other questions verbally that I didn't bother to write down, but I did write the answers since I was funneling these questions into automatic writing that night. One question I didn't write down but can remember was:

**Question:** Is there anything in my body right now that could be considered an implant? And if so, where?

**Written Answer:** Yes. Thigh. Left. Upper. Not much upper. Kind of deep.

**Question:** What does it do?

**Answer:** Monitors.

**Question:** Is it somewhere I can feel it and dig it out?

**Answer:** No.

I also asked it if there was an energy breathing pattern I could do that would benefit my body (I accidentally discovered pulling energy into my body a few months ago and am slightly obsessed with figuring out new patterns right now), and it gave me one. I can write it out if someone is interested but it's off-topic, so I'll avoid it for now.

So, that happened off and on for a while. Fast-forward until after Christmas. I was finally back home in the peace and quiet, was developing a cold, and not in the mood to be around anyone for a while. After working for a few hours that morning, I played some games, then sat down to meditate and within minutes was fully linked with some external being or intelligence that was very talkative. At first, I was automatic writing in a notebook but the info was coming so fast I had to switch to my laptop to type it out.

I shared a transcript of the channeling session elsewhere recently without the wider story attached. Here are PDF and plain text links. It is nine pages long and includes some discussion about other species, humans, and a brief talk about alien abduction. The PDF has the best formatting but will be hard to read if you're on a phone.

That's all at this point. Twice since I have felt what seemed to be an attempt at further communication (whether from the same communicator, I have no idea), but I am traveling for work right now and too busy to try another session. I will return home on Friday and hope to have another fruitful session this weekend.

If you're interested in these channeled messages, you can follow my Reddit account. I plan to post most of the messages directly to my Reddit user page so I don't flood any single subreddit with messages. If I ever get anything super interesting that comes through, though, I'll share it with the wider community."

169,A dream or abduction?,Abductions,20,"I'm your average teenager, I never really believed in aliens but believed something else besides us must be out there. Last night I had a dream that was so realistic i'm starting to doubt it was a dream. Typically I have short sexual dreams and then my mind goes blank and I sleep. 

It started by me feeling intoxicated, very cloudy and slow with decisions. I also remember waking up in a super bright room and the light hurting my eyes. I walked into a room with many other humans there sitting on a seat ledge. My mom was there and so was my sister and running coach, I sat next to my mom. It was dead silent and everyone looked very emotionless. There was a red swaying curtain and I lifted it up and looked through windows it was covering. When looking at the windows I became very motion sick and almost threw up. When I woke up this morning I was face down on my pillow and I had blurry vision for a solid 10 minutes. I didn't take a picture in time before it went away but I had a perfectly shaped triangle scratch on my neck and on my arm and a rash on my neck as well.  What's making me feel it wasn't a dream is that I could feel the ground when walking and also smell, I could feel myself sitting down too. I don't know if its my eyes fucking with me since I've been thinking about it a lot but my clothes slightly sway in my closet from time to time. I somewhat jokingly told my parents and they laughed and said i'm crazy, my 9 year old sister said the same thing happend to her but she's probably playing along. Has anything similar happend to you? I'm not gonna tell anyone because everyone will think i'm insane."

I'm asking because I am a long-time part of the abductee-community and saw this pair in a dream."
172,Abduction Documentary,Abductions,6,"Hey all, there was this really interesting documentary on YouTube that I never finished and can't remember the name of it. I searched through all the documentaries on there but can't seem to find it anymore. It was about a guy who had been followed by UFOs for about 18 years and I'm pretty sure he was abducted a couple times. If any of you know what documentary I'm talking about or would like to help then please help me out. Thank you in advance!"

174,Can Anyone Relate?,Abductions,12,"This is a vague yet vivid childhood memory that's always stayed with me but that I don't usually tell people about or if I do brush it off as probably just a dream. Well two different memories actually. I didn't really know anything about aliens when said events occurred between 4 and 5 years old. My story isn't the typical abduction story because I wasnt abducted (that I'm aware of) but ""visited"". I was around 5 years old and the sun was beginning to rise and I woke up and my long blonde hair was spread out over my pillow and there was a hand resting there with my hair kinda laying on top of it, a long gray hand, non human. I did not look up at the being whose hand it belonged to but I felt calm. It was communicating to me telepathically in a way difficult to describe because it wasn't really human language but I knew what it was communicating. I sensed there were more than one of these beings. They communicated that I was one of them and that even if I couldn't see them they would always be watching me and no matter what happened to me they would never let anything get too bad that I couldn't handle it because I had some kind of purpose. Then they went away. I didn't tell anyone about it for a long time but I was never scared of it /brushed it off later in life as probably just a dream. There was another time shortly before this where I was playing in my bedroom and my parents were in the kitchen when I saw what appeared to be a giant frog man humanoid watching me from outside my bedroom window (we lived in a remote rural area). That time I was filled with fear and labeled it as the boogeyman. I ran out to the kitchen crying, telling my parents they had to come to my room bc there was a big frog man outside my window. They laughed at me and told me I was imagining things and continued on with their adult conversations. I anxiously went back to my room and the frog man was gone. Anyone else have any similar experiences? I'm having trouble finding any info on the internet."

179,Did any of you guys believe in aliens visiting earth before you were abducted?,Abductions,14,"What's your backgrounds, where are you from?  I have a lot of doubts about aliens abducting humans though I believe in intelligent life in space."
180,Was I abducted?,Abductions,10,"Ok, I've always had this scar on my left wrist that looks like a tiny white tracker. I don't recall how I got it but I've had it since I can remember. I used to watch X Files with my Dad, we would talk about aliens all the time, and for a long time I thought the thought of other beings out in space was cool. Until this past June and last night. 

I'm shaking writing this. My husband is a skeptic and he believes I could of been abducted before. So here it goes: 

Whether I was or wasn't abducted, I've always felt watched at night. Every night. It's usually right before I go to sleep. It feels like I'm being pulled out of my own body right before I go to sleep. I had several nightmares of being kidnapped as a kid then they just stopped. But that fear of being taken has never changed. Lately I've had this pain in my...you know...the place aliens study the most. But the strange thing is this pain started weeks ago. It was before my experience last night. 

Honestly I recall how I felt more than what I saw. I told my husband about 30 minutes ago but he was half asleep so that's why I got on here. 

We went to bed at about 11PM last night and it felt like I was only tossing and turning for a few minutes.  It had been 6 hours. My husband chose to sleep on the couch since he had been snoring and didn't want to keep me awake. Moments after he left the bedroom, we live in a one bedroom apartment so the living room is only a few feet away, I felt like I was pulled out of my body and kept hearing humming sounds. Like a high pitched machine coming on.  I tried to bring myself back by screaming but I could only gasp for air. I did a couple times as loud as I could but my husband didn't hear me. We leave our bedroom door open and he's a light sleeper. 

I've seen these blue and green lights on the outside of a UFO before (back in June of this year). In that first experience I just brushed it off as a dream. Back in my first experience this summer, I found these two little kids in a red pick up truck in the middle of a commuter lot, they had no idea where their parents were so I took it upon myself to drive them to safety. I dropped the kids off at a nearby gas station and told the employee to call 911 to find their parents then I hopped in the truck and got back on the highway.  I was on this highway alone in the middle of the night for what felt like forever, the whole experience was creepy. Then out of nowhere there's a saucer shaped orb coming towards me. It was the ideal picture of what a UFO would look like when it got close. The door opened and the beam was like a rainbow but it was mostly white, and I was sucked up like a vaccum into pitch black darkness. I was immediately back in my body in bed. 

But last night there was light coming from the door instead of pitch black darkness like last time. The beam of light sucking me up was the same rainbow, bright blue/white color. The room I was in was all white, and shimmery like marble. The ceiling, walls, floor...everything. And several feet in front of me were four aliens. One medical table. And they were slowly pulling me towards them, I was floating in the air and being pulled by their power. The weirdest part was hard to describe. I didn't see their faces but their bodies were exactly like the greys description. Tall, grey, long necks, humanoid. It was like they didn't want me to see their faces and when I tried I heard this incredibly loud buzzing like TVs used to do when that freaky white noise channel would come on. Y'all know what I'm talking about. 

Within that sound was what sounded like a crowd. Just hundreds of people. Men, women, children, babies crying. I didn't know what to do. I was paralyzed, I just wanted to go home. I couldn't see it but I knew there was another room behind them, I just had this bad feeling that something terrifying was behind that door. Pitch black darkness with who knows what inside. Then right before I was taken back there, my husband has a coughing fit and it felt like I was sucked back into my body. All I could do was gasp for air before I got out of bed. 

I brought my blanket out, told him what happened, he reassured me I was safe (probably so he could just go back to sleep). But the odd thing is I don't feel safe. I never do. Especially at night after he goes to sleep. Thoughts? Am I crazy or is this really happening? Both times felt real."
181,Finally telling my story.,Abductions,4,"I've never shared anything on one of these pages before and actually just discovered Reddit this morning. 
I've had many alien encounters, mostly in dreams but I want to share with you all the most important one I've had. 
Back around February of this year I had a dream. In this dream I ""woke up"" in a room that was all white. I was laying on a bed but there was no padding and it was more like metal. There was also a sink in this room but that was it. Anyways, the whole dream consisted of telepathic communication. While laying down they told me to get up, but I didn't have control of my body. Next thing I know I was standing and the door to this room opened by itself. They told me to follow the line on the floor (which is funny because I had no control and they were doing everything for me). After following the line I find myself standing in a huge open room. There were tables and windows to the left of me. I believe I was on some sort of ship because outside the window it was dark and I could see stars. While standing there I noticed about 6 other people with me. I saw their faces and most of them were men, they were human but I'm not sure if they had any idea what was going on. There was also an observation area above me with double sided glass. There were beings behind it, and that's when I heard ""we are waiting for ""The ___"" I cant remember the name they gave him but it was significant. After waiting for what felt like forever he finally arrived and said ""we have you here so you can help us, each of you individually will know what it will be in time"". After that I woke up with the worst headache of my life. It was awful and I was shaking. But the kicker is a week after this experience I discovered that I'm a medium."
182,Here goes nothing...,Abductions,10,"I hope in this community of over 4k members that this story I'm about to share resonates with someone. To start, I have always had sleep paralysis. Off and on my entire life. This was NOT an episode of sleep paralysis. This was a series of very, very REAL experiences. 

The first episode was in the summer of 2016, I think. I remember waking up and seeing a being standing in my doorway. Upon realizing what I was looking at, absolutely all of my senses were disabled. Speech, hearing, eyesight and I was physically paralyzed. The being was able to disable my consciousness too. It was as if ""static"" completely filled my mind. Once my senses and mind were disabled, I was completely paralyzed and it would fade to black. I would awake in the morning, in my bed like wtf was that. I'd suppress it and try to chalk it up as a dream and go on with my day. 

This happened over and over that summer. I'd say at least 4-5 times. In one instance, before the being entered my bedroom, I awoke and was able to see it with my mind walking in my foyer downstairs. Its so hard to explain. Its like you have to experience it to understand it. That summer it was, I guess, ""the greys""-- your typical, small statured, big-eyed extraterrestrial. But one encounter was much different...

I awoke to 4 beings at the end of my bed. 1 male and 3 females. My son and daughter were sleeping with me that night. The females took my children out of the bed and over to the couch across the bedroom. I knew the kids were ok, the females were doting on them and seemed to be very nurturing. These were not greys, but rather multi-dimensional beings. They were light bodies with a blue hue and almost transparent. Once the females were away from the bed with the children, the male being made sexual contact with me. I don't know why but I knew there was a purpose. There was a reason. I wasn't scared and it wasn't frightening. I was in a relaxed, other-worldly state but I knew what was happening. Once he completed, the females said good bye to the children and placed them back in bed with me and we fell back to sleep and they left. I woke up the next morning completely beside myself because I KNEW what happened was very real, very WEIRD and that I could never tell a soul because someone would have me committed. I felt like a LUNATIC. Later that day, riding in the car my son asked me who the ladies were last night. I pretended he did not say that and I can remember my heart starting to beat rapidly and told him nobody and he must have had a silly dream. He was 6 at the time. 

I have since been visited 1-2x's by the greys. And it was the same as it always is with them, disable and paralyze. No recollection in the morning. 

Has anyone else in Reddit-land had a similar experience to either that of the greys or the multi-dimensional beings?"
183,Not really sure but i had some weird experiences as a kid,Abductions,5,"I wanna preface this by saying that ive always been deathly afriad of aliens, but also fascinated by them. Theyre literally the only thing im terrified of.

When i was way younger, probably around about ages 6-10 i vividly remember feeling nauseous throughout the night, and waking up to my vision almost zooming in and out repeatedly. One of the most vivid memories would be of my alarm clock across the room spinning and moving around. 

I had nosebleeds almost every night this happened, and never found out why. I also would be covered in random bruises (but thats more likely just normal kid things from running around outside and playing, but i figured i might as well add it). 

I also used to sleepwalk often, normally with no memory of it at all. My parents would find me standing at the foot of their bed mumbling gibberish or talking about completely random topics. 

I also used to bang my head against my pillow every night. My parents took me to the doctor for this and he said he never saw anything like it before. 

Finally, ive always been able to tell when something bad is about to happen. Either i get a really bad shiver and a feeling of anxiety comes over me, or i get a nosebleed or both. (Ie: i remember before the mandalay bay shooting i got a really bad nosebleed out of nowhere)

Anyone have any ideas?

186,Vivid recurring childhood dream I still recall perfectly today.,Abductions,18,"When I was a kid I used to have this recurring dream that to this day still terrifies me and fascinates me. It’s a big hard to explain and it was even harder to explain then but the images have never left my mind. I used to try to tell my dad about them but I never seemed to know how to describe it. These dreams would usually start while I was awake lying in bed awake, over top my reality like images playing, but once the dream was over I would wake up in bed as if I had been sleeping. Sometimes it would start the middle of another dream while I was fast asleep other times before I even fell asleep. In fact I have had trouble sleeping my entire life because I used to be afraid to fall asleep in case the dreams came back. Sometimes they happened anyway. It would usually happen suddenly and violently I would be almost snatched either out of reality or out of the dream I was having. Usually if I was dreaming it would happen with a collision. One time it started as I was dreaming about a brick wall, I was looking at it and there was a potted flower on a stool. I turned around and saw two headlights and a screeching noise and then the truck would collide with the wall and everything would turn white. One time I was dreaming I was at a pool party and when I hit the water with a loud collision I would wake up in this same white room. It wasn’t a room per se... I was in whiteness. A big white nothing. There would be voices but I could never understand them. But I knew they were talking about me. Deciding that to do with me. After thinking it over the years I almost assume it was a sort of psychic language perhaps. Something I couldn’t comprehend because I don’t remember the voices just that I knew they were talking about me. They would sometimes ask me questions and I would answer. Sometimes they would try to push me into tiny spaces and I would scream at them that I didn’t fit. Sometimes they would try to roll me out flat like I was a shirt going through an old fashioned ringer. I remember there would be two massive rolling pin like wheels and I would be pushed into them. When I say pushed, there was no one actually pushing me.. I was floating in whiteness... the rolling wheels were white the walls were white and these... people or whatever they were would be talking somewhere in the whiteness... as if they were so big I couldn’t even see them... as if they were also dressed in white and shining so bright I couldn’t make them out from the rest of the room. I remember feeling flattened and then stretched out and then really big and really small over and over again... this sensation of being really big and really small. Like I was being tested for how flexible I was. I really hated that part of the dream it terrified me and I remember protesting the whole time trying to tell them I couldn’t be rolled flat or fit into a tiny space but they still tried. I remember there was a woman though.. I don’t remember what she looked like but she was a motherly figure, like my mom and she would comfort me. I would wake up and be terrified of this woman and what had just happened to me and scream for my parents. This happened so regularly. It was the same, every single time it was the same. There were periods in my childhood where this would happen to me every night and I was unable to sleep because I knew they would come at night. I know this sounds like an abduction but I’m curious to know if there are any other possible explanations. Why does this still haunt me to this day and still so vividly? Why was it the same dream over and over again? I think it actually stopped happening to me sometime around puberty but that was around 10-11 and by then I was already staying up nightly to 3am at least unable to sleep. Sometimes even till the sun came up. Even now I am posting at almost 7am because I don’t sleep at night. I remember this dream often coming to me while I was awake, terrified and waiting and then the woman would show up and I would immediately fall asleep and be in the dream. If I was quick I would scream for my dad to come help me. To this day he tells me I used to talk about a woman in my room. And for those who are wondering, yes I have sleep paralysis, all the time. It sucks. I hate it. It happens when I’m wide awake too. I also have a rare genetic disease called Osteogenesis Imperfecta (type 1) inherited from my dad. Also, my blood type is AB-. My mom says neither she nor my dad have that blood type so idk where it came from. My mom is a positive not sure about my dad."
187,Waking up with weird marks on my body for years. (PHOTOS),Abductions,17,"About 4 years ago I tried posting this in r/Aliens without any response or information so I forgot about this and let it go, that is until more recent developments. The 1st picture is when I lived in California. I woke up with a square shaped sub-dermal rash on the back of my arm, it didn't hurt, it didn't itch. It lasted about a week. I pulled on it at an angle to get a photo so it is skewed but it was almost a perfect square. Also I looked around my bed for anything that might have that shape and maybe indented on me and found nothing. The 2nd and 3rd photo is in a hotel middle of nowhere Montana October or so of this year. I woke up at around 4AM with a headache and a small triangular cut in my ear. Happened again last month in Minnesota but I woke up at 2AM from a weird sound and my ear had another triangular cut 4th and 5th photo but it was bleeding. I spoke to my mother and she told me my ears used to bleed all the time when I was a child and she figured I was scratching the inside in my sleep, which is a possibility I guess, its just that all of these are geometric shapes which is weird from three separate occasions. I also have weird dreams and some weird occurrences if this gets any traction or if there is some interest I can go into some of those. Let me know what you think. 

TL;DR Been waking up with weird marks on my body and want to know whats going on.

190,I got abducted by the greys,Abductions,46,Last month I was abducted by the greys assuming I am not just making this up I have a few questions as to what they might have done to me. After I got abducted many changes happened to my body. First thing I noticed was my ass and balls hurt (semen extraction?) like hell and my stomach was in severe pain also. So obviously I may have gotten an anal probe of some sort which is pretty cliche for an abduction but what I cannot find any reports online about abduction is the severe pain I got in my teeth and gums I could barely eat for a few days and my gums were degrading I could just rub my tongue on the inside of my cheek and skin would fall off any idea as to what they might have done to me and why? I know there will be lots of skepticism as to whether or not I am just making this up and I wouldn't blame you but just assuming I am telling the truth what would you think they did to me?
191,Not sure what happened one night...?,Abductions,11,"So a couple of years ago I decided to air bnb a cabin up in Humboldt county and get away for a few days with my dog. Cool spot for sure. Small cabin on someones property, not far from the main house but plenty of privacy and my own hot tub. Decided to go out one night to arcata and meet some people. Stuck around at a taproom, had 2 beers and left back to my cabin. I had also brought an eighth of mushrooms with me and decided it was a good time to break those out and blend them into a smoothie once i returned around midnight. Enjoyed the smoothie, turned on my bluetooth speaker, some tunes and started to roll up some weed as I began to feel the onset of my trip. I remember everything starting to look bubbly and colorful, the walls were breathing and smashing pumpkins was playing on the speaker. My next memory is waking up at 7:30am, it was quiet, I was fully clothed with my blankets over me laying in the same spot I last remembered hanging out. A whole mushroom trip and no memory of anything at all? I had to have been active because how else would I have grabbed the blankets that I had left in the bedroom downstairs and brought them back up to the den and couch upstairs? If you've ever done mushrooms you would know that one just can't easily fall asleep especially with the dose I took. This is where the story gets weirder... 
After wondering what had happened after waking up I noticed that my leg hair on my ankle that covers a small tattoo of a flying saucer was completely missing. No signs of shaving or irritation, the hair was just completely missing over the tattoo(it took a while for the hair to start growing again). What exactly happened that night?"
192,Keep dreaming of Aliens trying to take me away... What does it mean?,Abductions,18,"
I've had a couple of dreams lately of aliens (greys) coming into my parents house and me running away from them. They always arrive at the garden (which is in front of the house) and I run towards the back to escape them.
Last night I dreamed that I was at the third floor and started seeing blueish white lights, like very strong flashlights and me getting very scared, knowing who they are and running away towards the back of the house. I woke up quite altered. The thing is I'm in Asia at the moment and my parents house is in Mexico so I'm quite far in terms of distance and time difference. The previous dreams have happened while in Mexico. 
Another dream I had was also at my parents house and seeing tall greys arrive at the garden and me trying to run away from them towards the back of the house.
Another dream I had was also them coming and me not wanting to go with them and then, they dressed as monks or something trying to lure me away with them.
What do you guys think this means? Are they trying to contact me? Is this a predictive dream? Any similar experiences?

198,Dreaming of meeting a Pleiadian man?,Abductions,16,"Idk whether to call this an abduction, dream, astral projection, dream invasion, or what, but here it goes:

It was nighttime and for some reason I was out in the woods, surrounded by pine trees and the stars were shining. I was looking strait, then around, and when I looked strait again the man was there a few feet in front of me, it seemed almost like he had a glowing yellowish-white ring outlining him; he was standing strait, and if I recall correctly, he was holding his hands down in front of his stomach with his fingers and thumbs touching tip-to-tip while aimed down.

He was a tall, physically fit white man, with blue eyes and long blonde hair a few inches past his shoulders, it was combed back out of his face and behind his shoulder, it was strait but also a little wavy towards the ends (I think; It's been a while since the dream so I don't exactly remember), and he had no facial hair. His wardrobe consisted of a long white thaub-like outfit with a dark redish-purple sash wrapped around his left shoulder, I also think he may have been wearing brown sandals... So yeah, he was basically dressed like Jesus.

Anyway, I was a bit surprised to see him there and didn't know what to do so i just stood there a bit wide-eyed and expressionless, and we just looked at each for a moment without saying anything before he gestured with his left hand, swinging it gently away from his body towards the woods on the left. I followed the motion and saw a large rock formation sticking out of the ground with a medieval planked wood door on the front, which was shut.

I looked back at him for a moment and he slightly nodded at me, then back at the door, and just as I was about to walk towards it I woke up.

Idk, I've always had this natural interest and attraction to Pleiadian-looking men since i was very young and knew nothing about the Pleiadians; Long blonde hair, fair skin, blue eyes, no facial hair, and well-built; I still don't know if it's just a natural interest or a connection to Pleiadians from some time before this life that has me beckoning to that type. Not to mention that years later I learned the Pleiadian star system is actually inside my astrological zodiac sign; Taurus (the bull).

&#x200B;

I know this could just be a simple dream from watching TV or looking into alien stuff too much on the internet, idk. I just thought I should share.

201,Possible abduction by the Short greys remembered as a 'dream' (Long/detailed),Abductions,9,"Short Greys: I quickly sat up, waking from a sleep, in a huff, I could feel my heart heart gently pounding and was staring in confusion at the ground trying to collect myself. Staring in the direction I was, and out of my peripheral, I could see I was not at home, yet I wasn't scared of that fact; Aside from waking up in a panic, I was completely calm about everything else that was going on around me.

I was in a wide metal room that had dim lighting except for small sources of light on certain things. The walls didn't have sharp corners, but rather sloped corners with random metal 'bubbles' occasionally sticking out near the ceiling and floor, towards the ground it almost looked like there was black rubber lining the walls, and I could see a few chair-like tables lined up (I think) 3 horizontal and 4 vertical, with 2 extra on the far left that run perpendicular to the parallel rows. I want to say it was some form of a 'alien' hospital or testing area.

The chair-tables were positioned on top of a thin metal table that sat on top of a single metal pole sticking out of the ground with 1 inch-thickish metal arms connected and sticking a out on the sides near the top of the table; And small individual bendable lights on the arm of each chair stuck up and were turned on, lighting up a small area. They were very flat and simple in design. If I recall correctly, some chairs had 3 flat sections to them that looked like they could bend; These were black-grey, if I remember right, and others were slightly sloped with many very slightly cushioned ridges, but didn't look like they could bend; I believe the chair colors were a beige/yellow/orange in color.

As I looked around my surroundings I noticed my chair. I was positioned on the 3rd and last table in the 1st column on the left side. My chair was much different than all the others; It had a full metal underside that took up the length and width of the chair; Even a bit past in some areas; the chunky metal connected and crawled up the wall behind me and then stuck out a longer piece of metal that was positioned above me; There was a small dim light shinning down on me with something bigger positioned on top. My chair was beige, more sloped, and had multiple more cushioned ridges, and had large bubbled side bars connected to it; I assume to keep me in one position and from rolling out. The severity of the slope made it seem like I was sitting and laying down at the same; Sitting up made my knees closer to my chest. I recall I was fully clothed, but don't exactly remember what i was wearing, I'm pretty sure it was the clothes I had went to sleep in; A black T-shirt and pajama pants.

The entire room was empty except for 6 small beings and 2 unconscious humans on the 2 extra tables on the left side of me. I noticed that the being were abnormally thin, small, and even in the dim room I could tell they were very pale, and knew they had to be the Greys, yet I still wasn't scared. I think it may have been a young guy (judging from the lack of a chest), I couldn't see his face due to the position the chair had me sitting. I recall him being nude, but I think he may have some sort of white paper towel covering his genitals. I could see small tubes sticking out of him and a bright light directly over him that was connected to the ceiling.

It didn't look like they being were trying to be cruel or harmful, but rather like they were trying to perform some sort of delicate operation. I couldn't get a good look at the tools they were using due them blocking my view with their bodies while working and staying out of the light when not working, but their outlines were small, some looked like they may have been scalpels and scissor forceps.

One being was doing the surgery while 3 were doing other occasional minor-looking tasks and handing the 'doctor' the surgical tools; All without talking; Seemingly just knowing what to do and when. The other 2 beings were checking on another body in front of that one.

The ceiling light on this person was off and I couldn't tell if they were male or female. they were hooked up to a machine with different colored lights (green, red, yellow, and blue) and I could still tell there were small tubes coming out of them, I could also tell they were fully clothed; I just couldn't tell exactly what they were wearing. One being was checking the machine while the other was watching over the person.

Thinking about it, they may have just finished performing surgery on both me and this person since we had our clothes on; But mine may have been over a bit longer as I don't recall being hooked up to anything or having any tubes sticking out of me. My chair also seemed more like a comforter; Making sure I relax after operation, while the other person was still on one of the medical chair-tables possibly still getting their vitals checked.

As I saw this all going on the being who was watching over the 2nd body heard me breathing hard and immediately turned and looked at me, noticing I had awaken they proceeded to quickly walk over. When they got to me they put a hand on my right shoulder (I don't recall how many fingers they had) and gently pushed me back into the chair and instead of fighting it I followed their instructions. They then proceeded to get a sort of oxygen mask-looking device from on top of the light above me and put it on my face; The device had a strip of black rubber-like material around the frame of the clear mask that covered my nose and mouth which was connected to my light by a black tube.

As soon as they put the mask on me I immediately blacked out and woke up in my room in, what felt like, a second later.

The entire 'dream' happened in the course of what seemed like 30 seconds.

\- Some extra things I noticed about the Greys:

\*They didn't have any sexual organs where their genitals would be; Instead it kind of looked like maybe a circle, slit, raw or something; I really didn't know what it was.

\* Distinction between genders could not be made.

\*No nipples.

\*large head and eyes, small thin body, short (about 4-5ft tall).

\* Their eyes weren't completely black, but rather their irises were extremely dark - almost black like their pupils.

The black flat chairs were very similar to this aesthetician chair:  [https://www.google.com/search?q=flat+black+3+section+chair&tbm=isch&tbs=rimg:CaDs9-aLIz4ZImCKWCBisSTPz2KtRzg7vZ6ukzPi7Tp1H5quuTUnWZhFMKHEm69IHahdYichJL5977JsMBM8y\_1T-QAPcCJkq6MCtJBWKM4OQFZqUsoqdR691ynhldy8\_1lxYfStvxCtGNkAcqEgmKWCBisSTPzxFg0brfEAC2ICoSCWKtRzg7vZ6uEUJJCSks7zQZKhIJkzPi7Tp1H5oR4KQvSeI-ytoqEgmuuTUnWZhFMBEGXtRJZL0ysSoSCaHEm69IHahdEfLuUdtNowIYKhIJYichJL5977IRk4xHOjop9IQqEglsMBM8y\_1T-QBFCSQkpLO80GSoSCQPcCJkq6MCtEWBWl8K-xKd6KhIJJBWKM4OQFZoR4KQvSeI-ytoqEgmUsoqdR691yhFoysjTMQ\_1uNCoSCXhldy8\_1lxYfEcymXIP9q36CKhIJStvxCtGNkAcRhtUAMcTW2KY&tbo=u&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi9tJfE9ZTmAhUKPq0KHQUBA6MQuIIBegQIARA2&biw=1366&bih=625&dpr=1#imgrc=7CPNfbdymTQOGM:](https://www.google.com/search?q=flat+black+3+section+chair&tbm=isch&tbs=rimg:CaDs9-aLIz4ZImCKWCBisSTPz2KtRzg7vZ6ukzPi7Tp1H5quuTUnWZhFMKHEm69IHahdYichJL5977JsMBM8y_1T-QAPcCJkq6MCtJBWKM4OQFZqUsoqdR691ynhldy8_1lxYfStvxCtGNkAcqEgmKWCBisSTPzxFg0brfEAC2ICoSCWKtRzg7vZ6uEUJJCSks7zQZKhIJkzPi7Tp1H5oR4KQvSeI-ytoqEgmuuTUnWZhFMBEGXtRJZL0ysSoSCaHEm69IHahdEfLuUdtNowIYKhIJYichJL5977IRk4xHOjop9IQqEglsMBM8y_1T-QBFCSQkpLO80GSoSCQPcCJkq6MCtEWBWl8K-xKd6KhIJJBWKM4OQFZoR4KQvSeI-ytoqEgmUsoqdR691yhFoysjTMQ_1uNCoSCXhldy8_1lxYfEcymXIP9q36CKhIJStvxCtGNkAcRhtUAMcTW2KY&tbo=u&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi9tJfE9ZTmAhUKPq0KHQUBA6MQuIIBegQIARA2&biw=1366&bih=625&dpr=1#imgrc=7CPNfbdymTQOGM:)

207,Hoping to find someone,Abductions,2,"Im hoping to find and talk to anyone who lived in or around the Sepulpa, OK area who might have had an encounter, sighting, or been the subject of abductions between 1992-1994. Im sorry it's a somewhat large range of time but my memory is hazy as to the exact year when my experience occurred and im wondering if it was just an extremely vivid dream that I only remember because it was traumatized me as a child (I was between 5-7 years old but for some reason, it's the most vivid memory I have of those years in my life)"
208,My close encounter in New Jersey,Abductions,3,"Ok this is not a abduction story.(It could be but I’m not sure if there was time lost) this happened like fifteen years ago. It was the middle of the night and I was taking my dog to the bathroom in front of my house. I lived in a dead end street surrounded by woods. I was waiting and I look up and about fifty feet above my head there was a very large metallic green ship flying very slowly making no sounds. The ship was shaped in a right triangle and there where lights underneath. I’m unsure how long I was there. It felt like minutes and before I even saw if it left I yelled for my dog and ran inside.

Again I don’t know if I had time loss. When I went inside to share my experience everyone was asleep."

210,"My Mums Alien Abduction in 1988 - Melbourne, Australia",Abductions,9,"During spring/summer 1988 when my Mum was 16 she recalls a night where she believes she was abducted by extra terrestrials.

At approximately 10:00 PM on a spring/summer night of 1988 my Mum walked her then-boyfriend to a bus stop down her street which was only a 2-3 minute walk from her house. Her boyfriend lived about 20km away and to get home he had to catch a bus to the train station, catch a train to then switch train lines where he would then switch train lines again at a further station and walk the rest of the distance which would take approximately 70-90 minutes. My Mum recalls saying goodbye and watching him leave on the bus. She then walked back home and when she arrived home the phone was ringing and when she answered it, it was her boyfriend. At first she did not believe it was him and then she asked if he was calling from a pay phone at the train station. He explained to her that he was calling from his home phone (mobile phones did not exist back then). In denial my Mum hung up and dialled his home phone to see if he would pick up, and he did. This left my Mum feeling startled and her boyfriend confused. At the time she threw around the idea of it being some sort of abduction but never investigated further.

However, a couple years ago when my Mum first told me this we did some research and found this UFO report:

*16.09.88 BALLARAT, VIC 2005hrs (NL)*

*AX 1988-001*

*Looking south-westwards towards a distant storm, two men noticed a white, spherical light pulsating on and off, and moving erratically in step-like motions. The noiseless object quickly moved in a north-easterly direction until it was lost from sight, after about five minutes.*

During the spring of 1988 a UFO was spotted around 8PM in a town about 135 km away from where my Mum was living. If on the same night the UFO would have had no problems getting its way to the city (where my Mum lived) in 2 hours (10:00 PM). Even if it was not this exact night there were still sightings around the same time as these events occurred.

We also searched up symptoms of alien abduction and found:

* Reports of missing time
* Celtic/Native American DNA
* Disruption to radio signal when close

These are just a few symptoms that are common in people who claim to have been abducted which are also true of my Mum. The most interesting part about this though is that after reading this we instantly made the connection to the fact that there is a radio in our house that whenever my Mum stands nearby to it becomes static and loses signal. My Mum also reported losing her sense of time (as stated when she arrived home to realise her boyfriend got home at the same time). My Mum is also Native American with some celtic ancestroy, I read that apparently extra-terrestrials target individuals of mixed celtic and native descent... not sure why? anybody know?

Growing up I also realised that my Mum has a lot of 'psychic' tendencies where she has fortold events and also connect with spirits. The latter is especially true as she lost a close friend of hers to suicide and she often tells me how she dreams of her friends children and then those things she dreams of become a reality.

What are peoples thoughts on this? Anybody else from Melbourne, Australia experience anything similar from the same time?

(btw this is my first post to reddit so i hope i did this right and in the right forum, my friend told me I had to upload it here after I told him about the story haha)"
211,It all started when I was young..,Abductions,7,"When I was a kid alot of weird stuff would happen to me. I can remember my childhood mainly by these weird moments of me wondering about the things happening to me, even though I was just a small child..but it got weirder as I got older.

I was about 15 or 16 years old now, I became interested in watching the sky at night because I wanted to see shooting stars. I lived in a ranch and the view of the sky was pretty nice, not super clear but you can see more stars out there. I ended up seeing very few of them from time to time, but I noticed the white light flashes some nights. And for some reason after a while I knew when to go outside to see them, and somehow I knew when to go outside. I was good at it I even showed my sister because she would make fun of me, but after i showed her she was amazed. Summer came and my sister left for vacation for 2 months to my grandparents so i would sleep alone in my our room. We had these old glow in the dark stars glued to the cealing  but they were quite old, old enough not to really  glow anymore. Years old.

One night I remember waking up to the feeling of weightlessness,  like if I was floating,...I didnt know I was actually waking up to this, I felt it more dream like. And then..I started to feel my bed. As I opened my eyes I suddenly felt as I was was being place on my bed. I felt my body touch my bed, and I opened my eyes wide. And that's when I realized the stars on my cealing. They were at full glow!! As if they had been under a light, but to be that bright and that old all I can imagine is them being hit by an extremely bright light....for hours!!  And the brightest glow on the dark stars were above me. I remember realizing that and being like wtf!! But then I guess I passed out real quick because I remember waking up again but this time it was day. And when I had woken up to the bright stars it was still dark..
 
And that was only the beginning to the strange things that were to happen next."
212,Dont Remeber Abduction.,Abductions,2,"Me and my daughter were home alone, we went to bed like any normal night. i woke up and grabbed some water and i have a window above the sink, and i live in a small town with a population of 100 in northern Canada. behind the bushes i saw greyish figures with eyes that look like cats eyes at night. from there i went to the back door to double check if it was locked, from there something happened, i blacked out but i faintly remember it was busted down. me and my daughter woke up in bed stiff and above the covers. i woke up like i was in dream but wasn't, not that much time passed, but i woke up frightened and paranoid. i went back to the window and i checked the back door everything was normal, but what wasn't was that that me and my daughter were in bed like that and i had a small bump on my leg that disappeared the next day. sounds weird but i cant explain what happened but that we were abducted. it wasn't the first time UFOs were sighted in my hometown. i would like to hear if anyone else has had the same experience."

214,I keep seeing it in my dreams,Abductions,8,"This place I can't stop seeing in my dreams for as long as I can remember.  I believe myself to be a lifelong abductee.  I suspect they may have had my consciousness  there and it became seared in my mind.  It is not a good place.

The place is like a giant city but feels like it's all under one roof.  No roads or cars- carpeted hallways packed with rooms.  A maze- countless rooms, hallways, stairwells.  Long hallways of offices, swimming pools, churches, gyms, clinics, amphitheatre rooms (I see stage dramas going on), stairways, catwalks, lots of round rooms, exercise classes, dentistry, nursery and school rooms that eventually stop abruptly at the end of the hall and becomes a vast and busy laboratory/ medical complex.  People of all ages everywhere, hurrying to and fro- harsh, serious people, humorless, cold, unwelcoming.  

Usually I will find myself wandering around the place, trying to figure out its' secrets, what happens behind all those doors, it's so secretive, they won't let me see.  I spend all my time aimlessly wandering because I am not included as one of the people who belong to this place.  I am apparently only supposed to be in the laboratory but I'm too scared of being in that place.  I think of Auschwitz.

The laboratory-hospital is immense, like a city.  It's mazelike halls seem endless.  I see high tech equipment everywhere, wires,  pipes, computers on carts, beds and rooms and curtains, men and women in lab coats and gloves.  It looks like a hospital but more colorful- tangles of blue and orange wires everywhere.  I see bodies on white carts all over the place and medical instruments and I feel death and suffering in the air.  I sneak around, I try not to be seen by the lab workers.  Sometimes I am taken and operated on, sometimes I am allowed to wander.

I am drawn to hallways full of strange offices.  Fascinated, I cannot read the colorful words on the doors that explain what all the different offices are used for.  I know intuitively I am not supposed to be seeing this, and that's why I'm drawn to it, I need to know what this place is.  I do not like this place at all.  I do not like the people.  I especially do not like the lab.  I know if I am seen in these office hallways I will be in trouble, so I sneak.  But without being able to open the doors or understand the words on them, I can't find the answers to my questions.  Strange things go on here for sure, things that I feel in my bones are very wrong.  

Could I be describing the inside of a UFO?"
215,Probable alien message sent through me. I need probable explanations or similar stories.,Abductions,24,"Well this is my first post ever, and as weird it may sound I think I served as a tool to send a messages to someone or something. 

This happened just last night and it was crazy realist. 

I usually stay up until late night so last night wasn’t too different from other nights, and also I have to clarify that I have experience sleep paralysis several times, so I’m used to that kind of experiences where is impossible to move at all or it is very difficult almost like if I was trying to swim upstream or if like gravity was too much to overpower and move. So with that explained, I’ll proceed to describe my experience as detailed as I remember.

As I said, I usually stay up until late night so last night was one of those days that I just didn’t go to my bedroom and lay down in the sofa, I like to sleep there because is very comfortable so nothing special or weird in particular, so I was practicing some French and let a video playing on my cellphone but felt asleep while listening to it, then when I realized I left the video playing I opened my eyes, paused it, locked it and put it aside and closed my eyes falling back again to my empty black dreams (cause I don’t have dreams very often).

So, after that I opened my eyes with a high pitch noise in my ears, almost like if a was listening to an old tv’s static at max volume, I immediately knew something was off so I tried to move but I couldn’t, I just moved my head a little bit to look around, and I don’t know how but all the sudden I listened a voice in my head and I quote “We need to send a message through you, yes or no?” and at the moment I was like wtf!! it was like if a was just listening to my own thoughts, so in my mind I ask back “do I have to decide now?” and the damn pitch in my ears became even louder and I thought (not trying to be funny at all, I really said this in my mind) “shit, I think that’s a YES” after that I stayed like 2 or 3 secs just hearing the now super high pitch sound and thinking about it, so I said (obviously in my mind) “Yes” and I felt like if I was passing out, cause saying I was falling asleep is way too different, and while my eyes were closing I saw a fucking alien, a grey one to be specific, I saw it cristal clear, it opened it’s mouth while I was getting closer to it, so when I went into his mouth (felt like falling into a hole) I started hearing like if a radio have been turned on and part of the “message” that I remember it said something like “you know that we are really here” after that I just felt asleep and the next thing I heard was like if there were people in my garage talking very softly or murmuring and heard like if someone was about to open the door, and then all the sudden the voices faded and heard just birds chirping so I woke up at 6 am, but I swear it felt like not more than a minute, also when I felt paralyzed and I opened my eyes it was dark, I could see the pitch black night even though I didn’t know what time it was I knew it was late night cause when I laid down in the sofa was almost 3 am.

Another weird thing, as I’m writing this, two flies are flying around my head (thing that is weird cause the house was totally closed last night), and a damn spider just walked beside me out of nowhere not something weird but just giving details. 

Other thing to add is that when I woke up I felt like if a was in a different position, and my crocs were too perfect aligned beside the sofa almost as if I had put them on and went for a walk or something.

I know is a lot to read but I wanted to give as much details as I could so I would like to hear your opinion I don’t know what think or what to believe."

221,Was this real? I’ve never forgotten it,Abductions,15,"Ok so I’ve always been a believer. I’ve seen ufos a few times in my life but I wouldn’t say I’ve ever been abducted or anything. At least not that I can remember. This experience is a little different but it seemed so real to me when it happened that I have never forgotten it and the only conclusion I can come to is that for a split second, when everything was quiet and I was relaxing, I saw something in my mind that scared the fucking shit out of me. A flash image. Like reality had pulled the curtain back and I was seeing something behind it that perhaps I wasn’t supposed to see. That’s how it felt anyway. 
Years ago when I worked the dinner shift at a restaurant I was laying down in my room in the middle of the day. Just laying on the bed. My eyes were closed but I definitely wasn’t asleep. I was the only one home so the place was quiet. I wasn’t thinking of anything in particular, just laying there. Then it happened. Bam. For a split second an image flashed in my mind, clear as day. It was of a dimly lit space like a cave or something with all these membranous pods sort of growing out of the wall in a row. They were kind of glowing, or giving of an orange red type of light. I can’t really explain it but it was like the only light in this room or cave was coming from these pods. They were person sized I would say, like a grown human could crouch inside one. There was a humanoid figure standing over one off these pods like he was examining it closely. I saw his face and it was almost like his features were melted or something. Or like they hadn’t properly developed. He was covered in grease or something like Vaseline. He didn’t look human but he was humanoid. Also, my immediate thought was that he was male and also that these pods housed either human people or aliens. It was over in a second and I sat up thinking ‘what the fuck was that?!’ It was so clear and so real looking. Nothing happened after that and I went about my daily life with no bother but I’ve never forgotten it. I can still see it as clear as the day it happened. Did I imagine it? Has anyone here ever had a similar experience? I’m looking for possible explanations but also just wanting to share my experience with people who are interested."

223,Second Guessing a Childhood Experience...Was it and Alien Encounter?,Abductions,6,"I work a pretty easy going office job and I consistently listen to podcasts while I do my work.That being said I've always had an interest in the paranormal and unexplained, so that's typically what I listen too.I was listening to a interview by Astonishing Legends with Terry Lovelace about the things he encountered and what he experienced from a camping trip in Devil's Den back in the 70s.To sum it up he touched on what happened to him and a couple of things stood out to me. It reminded me of something that happened to me as I kid that I always chalked up to sleep paralysis, but now it has me second guessing myself.

I must have been in about the 3rd or 4th grade. At the time we lived kind of on the edge of a bunch of farm land and woods. Our back yard opened up to our neighbors whom owned acres upon acres of land. And to the left of that was just endless farm land and forest. We lived a few miles away from a really popular and huge dairy farm, but we were also a mile or two out from a main road that leads into town. I guess the point I'm getting at is we were kind of secluded but not completely isolated. The Midwest is like that at times I guess.

My room at the time was in the basement, and the stairs that led down to it was right in front of our backdoor. I slept with my bed right in front of my bedroom door as well. It was summer break and after finally decided I was tired I went to lay down in bed. My memories goes in and out at that point and there's missing spots in between because I think as soon as I laid down I just blacked right out.

I remember I just woke right up after passing out, and I'm not sure how much time passed between these two point in time. But I immediately looked at the foot of my bed and the door to my room is wide open and theres this blinding light outside my room. I remember seeing this figure right in the door way to my room. I couldn't make out any distinct features because of the light coming from behind it. All I got was an outline and the shape of how it looked. It must have been not that much shorter than me as I was a kid at the time. Probably around 4ft I think. It had a huge bulbous head and a tiny body. In retrospect it was shaped like a Grey but I don't know if that's a cliché to say.

I just remember this utmost primal sense of fear, and I couldn't move. I've never experienced that level of horror before, and I haven't felt that feeling sense. I was laying on my back in my bed and all I could do was stare at it. I was trying to scream but nothing could come out of my lungs and I couldn't get up to run out or anything, I was completely paralyzed to that spot.

I blacked out again, came to, and it was closer, right at the end of my bed. At that point I tried screaming again and still nothing would come out and yet again I blacked out.

I came to that morning at the opposite side of my room, flopped across this little couch I had.

It's hard to explain it too because there's nothing in between these points of time its just a blank spot.

I tried to explain to my mom but it was just chalked up to sleep walking and a nightmare because I stayed up to late or something to that effect. For a while after that I was horrified to watch any from of alien movie or even just anything in tv that resembled what that thing was shaped like. I would have a full blown panic attack and start to hyperventilate. I've gotten passed that and that doesn't really get to me anymore....However I still to this day cannot sleep with my bed in front of my door or with my door open. I don't even like sleeping near the door, I need to be as far away from it as possible. Even during the day if I'm doing something in a room I need to have the door closed, having it open sends this just massive feeling of discomfort and anxiety, I can't do it.

I've experienced weird things through out all my life but after a while and with growing up I just always chalked it up to sleep paralysis but I'm not so sure anymore?

Can anyone offer any insight? Or at least tell me if I'm crazy or not because trying to explain it or even think about it just makes me feel like I'm nuts."
224,My experiences with abductions as a young child,Abductions,13,"Earlier this year, I posted my story on r/aliens but the mods deleted it for some reason. I've decided to share it again because it took me a long time to come to terms with it and it is the unembellished truth. I also want my story out there in case there is another person out there like me, someone else who does not believe in their own abduction until they see the account of another abductee that's identical to their own. In my case it was watching a talk by a man named Jim Sparks, and his recollection of his abductions were practically identical to my story. I've included links to his talk later in my post. 

I have direct memories of only one abduction event, but I am pretty sure I underwent routine abductions up until the age of six or seven. As a very young child, in the 1980s, I used to be taken by the ""Easter Bunny to the North Pole to play with Santa"" every year on Christmas Eve. I was sworn to secrecy about this or else the Easter Bunny said he wouldn't come back. These visits happened every year without fail.

At the ""North Pole,"" we would play together in a two dimensional space and the games we would play were educational in nature but very fun. The experience was more like a projection or video game but I would experience it as real. It's hard to describe. I have no recollection of the specifics outside of brief memories from my last visit.

What I do know is that I *loved* these trips—so much so that before my last trip (at the age of six or seven) I was actually *more excited* for the Easter Bunny to come and take me than I was for Christmas the next day! On this trip I was told I was getting too old for these visits and this would be the last one. I was profoundly sad.

For a couple years after the last Easter Bunny visit, all was quiet. Then, when I was nine years old, the first and only abduction I can clearly recall occurred.

I do not recall the initiating events. By the time I came to I was already being led into my front yard. It was lit up like day. I say ""being led"" but I cannot remember if I was alone or had some sort of escort. I want to say there were entities to either side of me.

My childhood front yard was basically a jungle, but there was one patch of grass that opened into the sky. On more than one occasion I had ""sleepwalked"" here as a child and awoken on this patch of grass in the middle of the night. In the center of the patch of grass was a tiny silver craft, what I would describe as a typical flying saucer only extremely small. The craft was so squat that I probably couldn't even fully stand up inside of it as a nine year old child. I would estimate it was five feet tall and twelve and a half feet across and it hovered about four feet off the ground. I do not recall if there was any sort of landing gear or if it was freely floating.

In front of the craft, walking toward it (and perpendicular to myself) was a classic grey alien. It did not acknowledge me. The creature was childlike in stature, probably a foot shorter than me at nine years old. I, having only seen my first drawing of a grey a few months before this event on a television program, should have been terrified (after viewing that program they'd immediately become fixtures of my nightmares). Despite that, being confronted by one in real life for the first time, I felt perfectly calm and serene.

There was some sort of opening into the craft but I cannot recall if it was a hatch or gangway. I was escorted toward the opening and I remember as I passed the outside of the hull there being Egyptian-looking hieroglyphics inscribed along the lip of the craft.

I black out.

I am seated on a bench in front of a glass screen. Across from me is a grey. Our attention is devoted to one another and we are interfacing through the glass screen device. I am in what I take to be the interior of the craft but the room is far far physically larger than would be possible based on the exterior of the saucer. There are other beings in the room who are engaging in other tasks besides what me and my partner are doing. My attention is wholly devoted to the screen and the task at hand.

The screen is a clear glass screen set on a table, approximately four feet in height, and there is some manner of console (on my side) that I am using to interface with it. I do not recall the grey having anything to use to interface with the device. The task I am devoted to had something to do with communicating between English and the alien language. 

A thought suddenly comes to me: *why am I using this device to translate between English and the alien language when we can just talk using our minds?* I find this thought very funny. I am having fun. Though the precise nature of what is going on eludes me, what I *believe* I am doing is typing in English and having it translated to the alien on the other side. This doesn't make much sense though, because I understand these beings to be able to communicate telepathically. As I use the device, the grey is also using it at times, whether to teach/correct/communicate with me I cannot recall.

I black out again.

The final stage of my abduction is a series of movies projected directly into my mind. I only recall two of them. In the first, I'm in an inlet in a sea in a sort of land before time. The Earth is primordial and pristine. I am moving through the water toward the mouth of the bay and along the coasts on either side is luscious, undespoiled jungle. It is profoundly beautiful.

The second is a snippet of apocalyptic environmental imagery. I see a breakwater or a coastline with a lighthouse situated on it. Waves are surging over the sides and consuming the coast. I am made to understand that humanity is responsible for what is happening here.

The abduction ends.

When I awoke the next day I didn't feel scared or terrified but a sense of calm and inner peace. My mind however felt totally overloaded, like way too much had been put in there to ever remember. I was startled by the fact that I hadn't been afraid of the greys because I'd been having constant nightmares about them as soon as I'd first learned about them a few months prior. I was far more concerned—fixated even—upon remembering the message I had been given. This message which seemed all-consumingly important began to slip through my fingers as soon as I'd awoken. It was only through sheer will that I was able to retain the two snippets I recall here today.

For many years I myself chalked these memories up to sleep disorders or being the fantasies of a child. I left them in my past. Then, a few years ago, I stumbled across a claimed abductee named Jim Sparks, and the parallels to my own experiences were insanely uncanny.

Instead of talking about medical experimentation or sperm extraction or other common abductee claims, he talked about how the aliens would place him in front of a glass screen to learn how to translate the alien alphabet. What's more, he talked about a mass abduction event that would have occurred when I was nine years old in which the abductees were all gathered and shown images of Earth's oceans undespoiled, prior to human damage, and then the deleterious effects of human industry and pollution upon the world. He talks about the specific environmental imagery the abductees were shown [here](https://youtu.be/UibJ-w0ieOM&t=05m06s). He talks about the mass abduction event at length in parts [five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl-YDHLz7ag&t=04m15s) and [six](https://youtu.be/UibJ-w0ieOM) of his talk. I will not vouch for the veracity of anything else he discusses because he does make some very outlandish claims. I am very hesitant of anyone claiming to know the nature or purpose of whatever this insane phenomenon is. I cannot deny though, at least for my own abduction experience, he was right on the money. What he describes is precisely what happened to me.

As someone who had repressed these experiences I just couldn't do it anymore after seeing his talk. It really *did happen* to me. The thought was liberating and terrifying.

I now make my living as an environmental scientist (ha, I know, right?). These memories do not dictate my life. For many years I used my scientific background and demands of proof as ways to dismiss my childhood experiences. But I was being dishonest with myself. I will now say whatever this phenomenon is, I am an experiencer of it.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I'm happy to clarify any details you may be wondering about."

This happened back in 1999 on  Long Island. My friend and his cousin were both 13 years old at the time  of the abduction. My friend told me that they were sleeping when a  light shine through his bedroom. Both of them then felt themselves being  lifted into the craft. Once entered the craft they walked down into a  hallway were they might six grey aliens. My friend and his cousin were  told by the aliens that they are going to perform experiments on them  because their race is dying. Both of them agreed to the experiments.  Then the aliens brought them into a medical exam room which had two  tables. Once there the aliens told my friend and his cousin to remove  all their clothing which they did. Once they got naked the aliens told  them to lay down on the table which they did. The aliens made my friend  and cousin to lay spread eagle on the tables which then the aliens  strapped their wrist and legs so they can't move. Once that happened  three alien performed experiments on my friend and others on his cousin.  My friend told  me that the experiments were the same. They took skin  hair blood samples. Also my friend told me that they also took sperm  from and his cousin by putting a suction device or their penises. They  did this by making them getting a erection once they were erect the  aliens put the suction device over their penises to extract sperm from  them. They thanked them for their sperm and dna samples. The aliens told  them that they can get redressed which they did. They were put back in  my friend bedroom. Only my friend told me what happened and no one else. Dose anybody else have similar stories
228,Two new pics and a request,Abductions,34,"Alright, two new pics and a request. I'm willing to do hypno regression. I have reached the point of desperation for answers. I feel like I cannot proceed further in life beyond this rut as long as I know too much, but not enough, if that makes sense. I posted [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/Abductions/comments/c8yy0j/my_experiences/) before that explains the major stuff.

Can anyone point me to reputable hypno therapists in this field who are located in the United States? I'm willing to travel anywhere within the US to visit them. Every person I've found who has a reputation in this field seems to no longer be accepting clients. I want someone who isn't going to act like I'm insane and who knows what they're doing -- I don't want someone leading me on or implanting memories because they think it's easy cash.

Here are two new pics:

This is a new clearer image of the scar near my right knee I shared in my last post. I was playing with my camping headlamp and accidentally discovered it has a bright red light setting. The scar is super visible in red light. It measures exactly 1/2-inch long.

[https://ibb.co/Y77TXTZ](https://ibb.co/Y77TXTZ)

Because the headlamp is so insanely bright, it immediately illuminated the scar (which is otherwise nearly invisible) when I turned it at an angle on my leg. So I used it to scan the rest of my leg and other leg for any other scars. That's how I found a second very similar scar in almost the exact same place just under and to the side of my left knee. It is basically impossible to see in natural light from looking down. I have no idea how long it has been there.

[https://ibb.co/X2tk1SF](https://ibb.co/X2tk1SF)

It has the same bowed shaped and dips down like a chunk of skin was scooped out. When I lightly rub it with my finger, I can feel a very hard lump directly in the center that is fixed in place and feels about 1mm wide. It is not painful. Because it is located immediately beneath the skin, I plan to try to remove it myself as soon as I'm able to buy a proper scapel and scissors. I'll report back with what I find."
229,"Sleep paralysis, or visitations?",Abductions,29,"Sleep paralysis, or visitations?

Firstly, this is my first ever reddit post so bear with me, I’m not very good at “story telling” or explaining things. I’m after some opinions here or possible explanations as to what I experienced as a child, also it’s going to be a long post... so TL;DR I think I’ve been periodically visited by aliens as a child.

It happened to me roughly 5 times, and I still remember them very vividly as if it was only yesterday. My parents always passed them off as dreams, and I myself thought “oh must just be sleep paralysis” as the symptoms match - but not exactly; and I’ve never heard or read of anyone having a similar experience. Even when describing their experiences with sleep paralysis.

The first time it ever happened I was in my new bedroom at the back of the house, my baby brother was just born and his nursery was my old room.
It was a normal night, I’d say around 2-3am here in Australia and I was awoken by the usual sounds of my baby brother crying and mum getting up to make him a bottle. I was around 7 at this time and I thought “I’ll get up out of bed and ask mum to get me a drink”
As soon as I tried to move, the room began to have this dark grey almost green tint wash over it and it became EXTREMELY hard to move, I wasn’t paralysed, it was just like everything was in slow motion. Trying to raise my arm felt like I was trying to pull it up against a strong water current and very, very slowly. I tried to scream, shake my head, make it all stop but it wouldn’t.
Then the next thing I saw was 7, very tall grey figures approaching me and then standing around my bed and looking over me. All the while this is happening I could still hear my mother and my youngest brother going about their business as normal... then nothing. I woke up in the morning.

This continued to happen a few more times throughout my childhood, exactly the same every time, except one time it actually happened when I was standing, just about to leave my bedroom to use the toilet, and as I said earlier my parents passing them off as dreams; but how could they be? I was so aware of what was happening and my surroundings.
From what I’ve read on sleep paralysis/night terrors is that you’re 100% paralysed and you can’t move, and it’s almost 99.9% of the time a demon or other spirit.
Ever since then I’ve been left with a strong interest in extraterrestrials and contact."
230,"Smells, sounds and other questions for abductees.",Abductions,17,"So almost every story of abductions i've read are mainly focused on what people see and feel. I feel curious about what you experience with your other senses. Can You guys tell us about your encounters?
What smells do You recognize when You are around the beings? Smells on board their ships/medical room? 
How do they feel to the touch? (If they ever grabed You) are they warm? Cold? What's the texture on their skin? 
I know 99% of the time they communicate telepathically, but since i've never experienced that, what do they sound like in your head? Is it like the sound your own voice have in your head? Do they sound high pitched? Different beings sound different from one another?
As someome with a little bit of synesthesia (i savour some specific textures when i touch them) have You had more than one sense triggered at once around them?

Have You met different species? Do all of them smell/sound/feel different from each other? In wich ways?"
231,"Called on aliens at night, something weird happened",Abductions,18,"I called on aliens at sunset to take me away because im tired of being here, then very late at night I heard a loud bang next to my window and some activity. I felt there was someone in my room and suddenly something was dropped from one side of the room to another. I closed my eyes scared and saw a tall reptilian like entity looking at me from my third  eye.....I heard voices in my head that were in another language. Upon researching these words they meant ""slave, submit, bow down"" (I will post them later) and no wonder reptilian entities see humans as slaves to their cause . What's strange it's that I SPECIFIED TO GET THE GOOD GUYS/ALIENS AND ONLY POSITIVE BEINGS OF LIGHT/LOVE but this bad one still came through. WHY?

In the morning I went to check for weird stuff around the evidence and found HUGE FOOTSTEPS all the way fom the hall to my window. There was no distinctive marks on the footsteps and almost looks like the sole of the shoe was completely smooth, anyone seen these before in your abduction stories? I mean it felt like a giant was walking around, reptilians are pretty tall so I guess their feet would be pretty big right? Anyone else had this experience of calling aliens and feeling activity later?"
232,The paralysis method [Idea],Abductions,4,"I'll start with a quick intro. It started when I saw a couple UFOs, nothing crazy, just orbs that would appear and disappear. There was enough daylight to ascertain these were not man made. At this time I had zero spiritual awareness. Fast forward 6 months.

I am now fully immersed in the whole spiritual realm and have interacted with other entities through the use of shrooms and meditative practices.

I take trips around my state in order to commune with places of power, last night I decided to take a break and stayed at a small motel. 

I got my room and tried to gauge its atmosphere. I then asked my spirit guides to carefully watch over me. As I lied down in bed I received a particularly strong intuition. 

You have to leave, leave this room, get out.

I decided I had already paid and ignored the message. Well, not entirely, I might've been abducted when I was younger so I was familiar with the sleep paralysis procedure. I told myself if it happened again I would pay even more attention to the procedure.

I left the tv on and started drifting into a slumber. In my sleep I'm woken up by the image of the UFOs I'd seen, I heard the words, return. I open my eyes, paralyzed, but I'm extremely calm because I kind of expected this. I see the image again followed by the word return. I then calmly asked, who are you? I got no answer. The paralysis fades and I can move again.

The paralysis effect: It seems the brain goes into a specific pattern of activity in our sleep, when we wake up paralyzed we just become aware of this mental activity. I felt as if the paralysis procedure was a way of locking the brain into in this state. This time rather than letting my thoughts carry me into a panic, I focused on my senses. I heard the tv, but it kept cutting out in a wub wub wub fashion. Like rotating a volume knob back and forth. All sound was like this. I then brought my attention to the peculiarity of being paralyzed so I got myself out of this paralysis by changing my mental state. It's what happens naturally during meditation as we ""stop"" thinking and ascend into a different pattern of brain activity. Just like that I felt like I popped out of the lock and I was capable of moving again.

I've never been able to get out of a sleep paralysis that quickly before. This time I felt comfortable in this state. 

I don't know if this was the precursor to an abduction. Last time I woke up paralyzed, heard a voice in my head, and then I saw the greys. This time I just broke out of paralysis before I could see them. I don't think they were expecting me to be able to ""phase"" out of this mental state lock so quickly. That or it was simply a message. The thing is, when you send a message that is negative to the recipient you usually follow it up with a threat or other motivation. I really have no intention of going back to the place I saw the UFOs. There was a strange honesty to the word though. Almost as if there is knowledge to be gained from going back, curiosity is the motivation, and breaking out of the lock so easily was a lure in order to get me to believe I could fight their paralysis....

I don't get it, if they wanted me there they could just take me there themselves.

During a strong meditation I attempted to remember if I had actually been abducted as a kid or if they had just stopped to do an initial assessment and left without taking me. 

I couldn't really recall anything except for an empty, hazy, white room, and the words, ""This is not real"". This is something I would've told my younger self in order to feel better. It's also something I would've told my present self who is aware I can imagine fake memories. 

Once again I can't tell what is what, or what to do next. Anyone familiar with the ""this is not real"" phrase?"
233,Do you think can be an abduction?,Abductions,5,"
Some years ago there was a periodi Where i often woke up in the night with José bleeding. 
Then sometimes i woke up because i felt like the bottom part of the bed was rised for a brief moment. 
Sometimes i wake up with sore throat. 
Last month i saw 4 times an orange orb flying in night sky from West to East and slowly disappear (because of this i begun to read about ufos and abductions) 
Sorry for bad English. What do you think? Can i be an abducted?"

235,"A little of books about abduction studies as recommended by ufologist, Keith Rowell.",Abductions,2,"""Abduction Studies

Today abduction studies occupy a big part of ufology. Understanding of the abduction part of UFOs came slowly to ufology. And it was only in the 1980s that the extent and complexity of the abduction phenomenon was realized. Some ufologists believe that this is the key to understanding UFOs.

Bullard, Thomas Edward. UFO Abductions: The Measure of a Mystery. Vol. 1: Comparative Study of Abduction Reports. (Bloomington, IND): Fund for UFO Research, 1987. 402pp. This study by a Ph.D. folklorist is must reading for anyone wanting to understand the depth and breadth of the abduction enigma. Bullard concludes UFO abduction stories are much too internally consistent down to small details to be classed as traditional folklore or typical dream material.

Chalker, Bill. Hair of the Alien: DNA and Other Forensic Evidence of Alien Abduction. New York: Paraview Pocket Books, 2005. 341pp. ISBN 0-7434-9286-2. A top notch Australian researcher presents evidence that demands attention. DNA tests on hair found within the context of alien abduction tend to prove that something strange is happening. Read the full account here. This is an example of the kinds of research that could be done if adequate time, money, and expertise were ever devoted systematically to ufology. But the powers that be (the secret part of your government) are determined that this does not happen. So, Chalker and ufologists continue to be marginalized even though their work is intellectually respectable.

Conroy, Ed. Report on Communion: An Independent Investigation of and Commentary on Whitley Strieber's Communion. New York: Morrow, 1989. 427pp. ISBN 0-688-08864-3. This journalist was a boyhood acquaintance of Strieber. When Strieber published Communion, Conroy decided to see if his story would hold up under an investigative journalist's scrutiny. Conroy says yes.

Druffel, Ann and D. Scott Rogo. The Tujunga Canyon Contacts. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1980. 264pp. ISBN 0-13- 932541-7. Good book about abduction/contact experiences.

Fowler, Raymond E. The Andreasson Affair. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1979. 239pp. ISBN 0-13-036608-0. Fowler's first book about a now famous abductee, Betty Andreasson Luca. This book and Fowler's other books on the Andreasson abductions incorporate Betty's fine drawings of her alien abduction experiences.

Friedman, Stanton and Kathleen Marden. Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience. Franklin Lakes, NJ: New Page Books, 2007. 319pp. ISBN 1-56414-971-4. The definitive study of the famous Betty and Barney Hill abduction case.

Hopkins, Budd. Intruders: The Incredible Visitations at Copley Woods. New York: Random House, 1987. 223pp. ISBN 0-394-56076-0. Hopkins' second book. He says it is likely that aliens are mixing our genes with theirs, and this is a major purpose of the abductions.

Hopkins, Budd. Missing Time: A Documented Study of UFO Abductions. New York: Richard Marek, 1981. 258pp. ISBN 0-399-90102-7. Hopkins' first book about abductions.

Hopkins, Budd and Carol Rainey. Sight Unseen: Science, UFO Invisibility, and Transgenic Beings. New York: Atria Books, 2003. 406pp. ISBN 0-7434-1218-4. Excellent book about how many of the phenomena described by UFO abductees and experiencers might be explained by mostly cutting edge science. Speculation, but informed speculation — the kind that people who treat UFO evidence with a calm, patient, methodical, and rational habit of mind are capable of.

Jacobs, David Michael. Secret Life: Firsthand Accounts of UFO Abductions. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1992. 336pp. ISBN 0-671- 74857-2. Still one of the most important books on UFO abductions. Start here because the presentation is a just-the-facts, ma'am, blow-by-blow account of what Jacobs believes is happening. He says essential aspects of all abductions are absolutely real in ordinary perceptual and space-time reality. However, there are definite perceptual and space-time anomalies too. When people report that they had a missing time experience of two hours, Jacobs says they are actually bodily missing from planet Earth, or at least human beings cannot find them on Earth! A warning to extreme skeptics and debunkers: this book may be hazardous to your mental health!

Jacobs, David Michael, ed. UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge.Lawrence, KS: University of Kansas Press, 2000. 382pp. ISBN 0-0-7006-1032-4. A bunch of UFO scholars have their say about what it all means. Dry reading, but where the UFO is inevitably headed if the U.S. military opens up, which may never happen because of the serious potential national security implications of public knowledge of UFOs as a certain reality.

Leir, Roger K. The Aliens and the Scalpel: Scientific Proof of Extraterrestrial Implants in Humans. Columbus, NC: Granite Publishing, 1998. 231pp. ISBN 1-893183-01-7. You want hard evidence? Sure, everyone does. Here it is. Do you think the academic establishment has completely ignored this? Gosh, you would be right. Now, I wonder why? It isn't lack of rigor or lack of proper methodology or lack of intelligent application of reasoning in this book. It's the lack of backbone and intellectual honesty in the academic establishment which causes their abject failure to do real science in the face of hard evidence. Doctor Leir has come and gone now, but his legacy lives on in his work in ufology.

Randles, Jenny. Abduction: Over 200 Documented UFO Kidnappings Investigated. London: Robert Hale, 1988. 240pp. ISBN 0-7090-3276- 5. A British UFO researcher does a book about abductions. It is important for showing that abductions are not just a North (or South) American phenomenon.

Ring, Kenneth. The Omega Project: Near-Death Experiences, UFO Encounters, and Mind at Large. New York: William Morrow and Company, Inc., 1992. 320pp. ISBN 0-688-10729-X. An early important study of the psychological characteristics of NDE-ers and UFO abductees/experiencers. Turns out there are many, many similarities. Why? Easy. Because UFOs are part of the transpersonal/spiritual world.

Rodwell, Mary. Awakening: How ET Contact Can Transform Your Life. Leeds, UK: Beyond Publications, 2002. 301pp. ISBN 0-903782-03-1. Author Rodwell, a mental health professional from the UK and Australia, details what it is like to be a UFO abductee including the spiritual aspects.

236,Abducted from baseball practice,Abductions,9," My friend Nick and I were both 13 years old at the time. We were walking  back home from baseball practice when both look up and saw a ufo it was  big. We tried to ran but it caught up to us . We were both beam up  into the ship. Once we entered the ship we were  approached by 4 grey aliens. Two took me and other two took my friend  to exam room, which had  two tables. The aliens told to remove our  clothes which we did. We unbuttoned our baseball uniform shirts, took  off our shoes, socks unbuckled our uniform pants  and removed our boxers. Once naked the aliens told us to lay down on  the tables which we did. Two aliens performed experiments on me other  two on my friend. The experiments were the same. They took hair samples  from us blood and skin samples . Then they took  sperm samples from us by putting a suction device over our penises.  They made us to get a erection which they did. Once we had a erection  the aliens put the suction device over our penises to extract sperm from  us. We both had our first orgasm. Once done the  aliens told us they need our sperm because their race is dying. They  told us to get redressed which we did. They put us back were we first  got abducted.

When I mentioned the abduction theory she didn’t know any of these things are pretty common with abductions and didn’t know of the “tall whites”.

Last night I watched that new joe rogan video about aliens before bed.

I went to sleep and had a series of weird dreams, one of them was I was in a hospital room of some kind with Drs and that were either putting or pulling something out of my arm or both. A few seconds after they did that I woke up quickly to my phone resetting itself - which it sometimes does but I've never woken up to it before - it was a bright white light before the Verizon logo. And my arm hurt in the spot that i had been operating on in the dream.

Shit was weird. I'm not one to really believe stuff like that. But i was left with the thought that it was a preparatory surgery of some kind. I have had the sense I will die soon and I felt like it was a part of a transition process.

Wether or not it was aliens or my subconscious preparing itself. Who knows. But i thought it was a cool story and that I would share it."

I had a dream about a little spaceship a soccer type aircraft but it was about the size of a medium sized dog after I ran into the room, it flew under the front door of our house and slowly kept toward the back room where I was at and then it changed to being in this strange place with a bunch of different beings. I woke up next to my mom startled but I don’t know I just pushed it back.
When I turned 13 it happened again except  I was in sleep paralysis I couldn’t move, I was looking at a computer screen that had a bunch different pictures it would cycle threw, well it got stuck on an image of smoke that looked like a demon coming out of a building it wouldn’t change to the next picture, I couldn’t move and I was stuck when I finally got the strength to move witch took every thing out of me I was filled with dread and fear and ran into my step moms living room. 
There was one more time I went into sleep paralysis In a hospital the patient next to me said he saw a lady looking figure in the corner of the room staring at me and I was making noises, I remember trying to scream for help and to move my arms and try to stop whatever it was but all I could do was tap the wall in the end before I passed out, it felt like I had a seizure the next morning after it happened. 
The last time i can remember having an encounter was just 3 years ago me and my Wife were sleeping in our old room in a basement I remember having a dream but it felt real, I was yelling telling my wife  that it was going to be okay and that every thing was going to be fine, they were taking us somewhere, a couple weeks later I was talking to her about the dream and just general freaky stuff and how I thought it was real  we lost about two hours of time when we were in the car talking, I pointed it out to her because there was a general sense that time had transpired but I couldn’t remember, she started screaming and crying running back into our house I’m only 26 now. She still doesn’t like to talk about it and gets mad if I bring it up."
251,Sleep paralysis or abduction?,Abductions,4,"Last night was odd for me. Here is some background: I've lived with hypnagogic hallucinations for most of my adult life, their onset happening in my late teens / early twenties. I haven't had an episode of sleep paralysis since my early childhood, though. Back then, it was a fairly common occurrence, but they stopped for the most part around the age of fifteen. 

Last night, I had the worst headache I can remember having in years. My girlfriend had to put pressure on my temples (which helps a lot) for about an hour until they subsided to the point where I could fall asleep. I must of slept for about two hours, when I awoke to something touching me. The touch felt revolting to me. It was like fingers touching my feet, legs, and ribs. I remember getting angry and panicking, jumping out of bed (my girlfriend was still asleep), and running into the guest room where I tried to close the door. Something was pushing on the other side of it though. I am not a weak dude, but the thing pushing on the door was way stronger. The door burst open and there is this bright light filling the hallway, and I can't see anything. 

Next thing I know, I am in my bed, lying down with my eyes open. I am wide awake and alert, however I cannot move my body at all. I try to say my girlfriend's name several times, but I notice that I could barely push the words from my mouth. It subsided about five minutes later, and left me feeling the strangest thing. Like I was in my home with the person I loved, but it wasn't my home. Something similar but different in these subtle almost indistinguishable ways. 

I guess I am posting here because the whole thing freaked me out. Today, I felt like I was in a daze. Everyone seemed to be acting different; friends, my boss at work, the faculty at the college I work at. Has anyone had something similar happen? Any advice?"

I remember looking up and seeing planets and stars. It was 3D, I remember the planets getting closer and closer and then it would change to a different hologram. They showed me one of an astronaut floating through space at one point. I remember someone taller being to the left of me, I feel like they were controlling what was being shown to me or something. 

Is this common in abduction experiences? Are there other reports of abductees being shown holographic images? I’ve heard of it a few times but I’m curious just how common it is."
255,Forced OBE w/ Encounter - Maybe Someone Can Make Sense of It,Abductions,27,"Hello. I am hoping this is the correct sub for this, as I have read other posts containing OBEs but there seems to be an alien interaction in its typical form (extra terrestrial)  Although Ive had encounters of various kinds, this deals with an alien being in the context they were non-human entities and foreign to me.  I had the feeling they were more of what you'd think an angel-type of some sort is, but they weren't glowing in light and this was not a religious nor ND experience (I didn't die, as far as I know) . Regardless, maybe someone else caen glean some insight...I hope!

Everything was a typical day for me, except my children actually went to sleep on time with no issue ( haha I should've known something was up!) I remember laying on the bed and the moment I closed my eyes, everything spun.  I had a sensation of being sucked up and out of my body as my physical self spun away.  Almost like if 2 suction cups were put together and then, after good suction attained, pulled apart. 

I was guided and although I had a wtf moment, there was no sense of panic.  Everything was dark, maybe pinpricks of light far away and curved around, as if I were in a curved place (like looking at pictures of the world- how everything arcs). I don't recall much until i reached a place that to me, i knew was Italy.  I could describe the landscape in depth, but to save time and not go Stephen King descriptive, I'll be brief.  I glided over countryside, mountains, saw ocean but *everything went whizzing by*, I could not linger and felt like I was on a rapid guided path... like an otherworldly conveyor. I only slowed slight and recognized Venice. Then it was through a peculiarly low door, something ancient.  I remember the color of rust and brick, but then it was down down down.  The door never opened and I went through a dank, cobblestone style brick? corridor.  That's when I saw *them*....
They were massive.  Larger than I could truly comprehend.  6 gigantic ""angels""? but they had their arms crossed in their chests, which had theri bodies encased or imprisoned in these bricks.  There were what I think sarcophagi in alcoves in either side.  Giant lecterns in front of them with a proportionate book.  They were all ""meditating""... but they were in chains.  Terrifying to look at something so huge and alien to me but also so human looking.  I didn't have much time to look at them as I felt my being forced into another door, for some reason in recollection i think of a pub and i feel there are parts of this my mind locked away. 

That's where I saw ""Him"". It felt as though I were in an interrogation room, as I was placed inside this bizarre, perception altering room.  It felt as if the side of this white marble half- wall counter were meant for my height yet He was massive. He wore a brown very old style outfit, I'm talking year 1AD style, almost caveman-ish in that it was only covering one shoulder in brown, handwoven linen type fabric. He had shoulder length brown hair, kind of air dried or possibly dirty, but not matted. And it had mild waves, not stick straight but not curly at all. I guess I was allowed a moment to take it all in, I am very confused right now in telling this. I don't understand.  I also saw wings. Beautiful black wings but they were ruffled, like he was injured a bit.  

There was a long silence and he was patiently looking at me.  I noted too, at this point I was in a grayish- white dress, almost like a sleeveless night gown. He was slightly smaller than the beings outside and appeared to be seated.  My mind started to drift back to my descent through the door and then what felt like miles of earth to reach this corridor.  But then he spoke.  It started with an introduction, for the life of me all I can remember is the name he gave began with a T and was 3 syllable. He spoke actual words, not inside my head, and explained he was a neutral being.  That there was a division and he refused to take sides and that he was too remain there until some event.  But he stressed that they needed me and when the time was right I would remember everything. Thar I had something really important to do and if I didn't, then it would fall to my oldest child, as she ""carries the inner mark as [I] do."" I remember that at one point, the light was dim and dank light candle lanterns, and there was a soft murmur behind him of several people.  It felt like I was in an underground pub of sorts, and there was a big bald ""man"" (he felt human) that kind of sideways said something to T and then I heard the clank of glasses. T said something back that I couldn't understand and then gave me a strange look.  Thinking now, I would nerdily say he was sort of chaotic neutral and I have to laugh at this, because I'm truly flummoxed. 

We had a bit more conversation that I don't remember, but then he told me to go back and wait to be contacted.  That I had to go past the 6 giant beings and not say a word to them.  I was gently and firmly pushed by what felt like a giant warm energy source, firmer in the middle and softer as it radiated out from the center, back into the drippy cool hall in front of the door. I put my head down and walked as silently as I could past the 6 to a bright blinding white light at the end of the ""room""  I remember it took an eternity to cross and in the musky the was a circular opening covered by a grate that looked like a well that went forever.  I couldn't step over this grate, wrought iron like a massive gate in the floor and I felt a feeling of terror if i were to disturb those... those being from whatever they were doing.  

As I got to the light, the were really large slabs, similar to the rest of the hall, only here everything was massive.  I got to the second step and heard what sounded like heavy chains rustling and felt a crippling headache. Like a migraine.  Then I heard the groan.  I hid behind the last pillar, these didn't have the candle lanterns as the ones in the room.  It was dark and the intense light didn't saturate the room, it was almost contained, i guess.  So the only light was from lanters along pillars and the dome in the ceiling. 

 I cannot emphasize enough how massive everything was, and yet I never felt small as a presence.  I just knew these things were incredibly old, strong and chained up.  Like 50 yards tall from the waist up.  The chains and wings were so much, I remember being literally and still to this day, I remain in awe.  My mistake was I looked back.  It felt wrong, even though the sounds from the chains and that horrible groan filled my head and made me turn.  1 was looking at me.  It felt like contempt.  Then I was scared.  This wing that seemed to span maybe that of 3 or 4 extended pickup trucks or suburban suvs... the eyes were not ice blue but had some green to it.  They weren't human eyes, like a baby alligator is the closest I caen think of to describe them. Jet black hair, again slightly wavy and maybe dirty.  Features somewhat asain in the brow bone and eyes when closed. Flawlessly built.  

It was awe inspiring and terrifying.  When I ""returned"" it was as if I stepped through the white light, was consumed and then I felt a distinct *pop* and I was in my bed.  A moment later my daughter woke me up.  I looked at the clock and it was 02:11. I went to bed between 00:30 - 01:00. She said I scared her because I wasn't there.  She fell asleep in my bed and why did I ""wake [her] up by jumping on the bed?"" That changed how I thought if this.  I thought it was a dream. 

Many times I felt that spinning when laying down and would wake up and not recall anything but blackness. 

Some things to note, and only because they apply.  I am a Muslim female, I don't dress in short sleeves nor, do I appear in public without a headscarve. Also, at this point in my life, nothing frightened me as I accepted things as God's will.  To wit, I do my best and if He wants to take me from this earth, I accept it and have had experiences testing and confirming this acceptance and lack of fear   The events as I was leaving frightened me to the core. 

This is not an r/nosleep. It is as real to me as my life.  I just wonder if anyone ever heard of something similar or could help me make sense.  My searches to date have yielded nothing.  I also don't practice lucid dreaming and meditation (outside of prayer, if it's considered such). As I mentioned earlier, I have had other encounters and the galaxy-eyed man that I posted about, he visited maybe a year after but not longer than that. My mental state was good and I had nothing chaotic occurring.  So, if you will ... (questions are fine, but please don't be mean spirited) I look forward to hearing constructive feedback!

PS - ETs can have many appearances, this is also why I don't state that the beings encountered were angels, aliens, jinn, demons etc. I forgot to pick up a copy of Extra Terrestrials 101 - The Definitive Guide to Classification ;)

I will see if I can sketch the room and show on imgur. I also have a feather that we found, but we're renovating and I put its cae into storage.  It is a feather easily 1 yard / 3 feet in length and approx 4 inches wide. My daughter found it the next morning in my room. My hair and skin had a strange smell to it also, as I had showered before bed."

257,Suicidal Abductee,Abductions,58,"I guess the weight of all the trauma has caught up with me, the worst event was having an ""implanted dream"" experience where I was forced to walk across a bridge with strangers being screamed at by an alien man that we'd been ""chosen for survival.""  In that abduction experience I did not know where I was, where I was going, where my family was, hell where the earth was.  

That was the straw to break the camel's back.  Years later, I am deeply confused, why did it feel so real?  It is this trauma which is eating me up inside, I've had multiple abduction experiences of waking up in an alien world, not remembering anything.  Before these experiences I was deeply religious and had a strong faith so I was coping as well as could be expected with death, because I believed all my loved ones & my soul would end up in the same place after death.  That was my stability.  The one thing in life I need to be sure of.

The abduction experiences have made me terrorized about living, terrorized about being taken, about ""survival"" and apocalypses.  The idea of waking up in another world alone...without my family, without my memories.  I was not fearful of apocalypses before.  I was not dwelling on death before.  Now I am obsessed with death and too distraught to move.  I just want sleep, I'd sleep forever.  I didn't remember to eat yesterday & still not hungry.  I am numb, numb I can not feel. 

I keep thinking the only outcome for me is suicide, if the aliens are gonna take my world away.  I just want to die so it can't happen, understand.  I want the particles & atoms that I am made of to rejoin my loved ones after death.  But these abductions have caused me to panic, and I am lead to the conclusion that I must suicide so they can't take me.  I am hanging on by a thread.  If I suicide, my mom wouldn't be able to take it.  I'd destroy my family.  But if I don't suicide, the ""entities"" are making me believe that I'd be forced to survive an apocalypse.  This would not be a preferable option to death.

I have asked whatever gods may be that if there is an apocalypse I can remain, and stay with my loved ones, die with them and go on into after death with them.  I would never have it any other way.  I don't see a way to go on.  I feel trapped & that I will need to break my body to end this crippling anxiety over the unknown.  How can I get them to leave me alone?"

The question is, ""Where is the ship?""

The second odd thing is a phrase that runs through my head when I think of a specific abduction experience.  ""Green means stop.""  The entity that asks the 'Where is the Ship' question was present.  I'm not sure why the phrase pops into my head.

I'm interested in any theories of what this might mean."

262,"Bright Blue Flash, anybody else experience something similar?",Abductions,6,"About 10 years ago a friend and I were walking in my neighborhood at around 2:00 am.  We live in a quiet area in the suburbs outside of a large city, so it's pretty dark at this time of night.  We were making our way back to my house when suddenly there was an extremely bright flash of blue light coming from about eye level right around the corner of the block.  We headed that way and were where it seemed to come from within 20 seconds, but there was nothing at all to see.  We both felt like we had seen something we shouldn't have, but have no explanation for what we saw.  All these years later we both still remember it vividly.  Is this something anybody else has experienced?

TL,DR: Friend and I saw a bright blue flash of like late one night in a place that certainly doesn't have anything to produce the kind of light we saw"
263,Bob Lazar brought back a flood of memories...,Abductions,29,"When I was 8 or 9 I started to have horrible sleep paralysis, it became constant, almost a nightly experience. Eventually I fought through the paralysis to where I could tear through what felt like a sheet of numbing material placed over my body. One night I lifted my head up during an episode of paralysis and at the end of my bed I saw a 3ft tall skinny figure with a large head, large black eyes, small mouth and Caucasian colored skin, this was my first experience. I had several short experiences that were similar but always wrote them off as dreams. 
I eventually moved out to the country in my teens. When I was 14, I was taken. I woke in a very plain gray room, and there was three grey aliens, pale in color. One was right next to me smiling, he had a device that looked like an Iphone and he had it up to his head as silly as that sounds but this was back in 1999 or 2000, well before iphones. Now the reason why I bring Bob Lazar up is because his description of the inside of the alien craft was exactly what I saw, three small panels, child seats and that’s it. The metal was cold to touch. I woke up at 4:23am that night, went to the kitchen and just started to wash dishes. My mom walked out at 5am asking why I was up doing chores I replied “you won’t believe me... I was abducted”. She said, I heard a door slam and saw lights but I thought it was your step dad, she panicked and called my step dad who was a cop at the time, he wrote it off as a dream, but this was too real. He never stopped at home that night. 
Since that night I’ve only had one similar experience. Right after my daughter was born I was sleeping in the living room of my apartment with my wife and baby, I woke up in the same state of paralysis but fought it just as I did when I was a kid, I saw a tall figure standing over my bed, this time I couldn’t see any other description other than a shadowy figure. I woke my wife up, as she awoke the figure faded away as if it was sand falling through your fingers. My daughter said she sees small people now, or someone would be staring at her at night. I don’t sleep at night anymore because of it. I don’t want her to go through the terror I went through as a kid."

265,Possible CE in childhood,Abductions,5,"A couple of things 1st: English is not my native language so if there's anything that comes out a little confusing just ask away. Also, i'm typing this on my phone, so editing may be a little wonky. And last, this is a throw away account, but i Will check it periodically.

A little bit of introduction, I'm from south america, this happened in 1992, I was 7 years old then, I was not the only witness of the event because I was with my cousins that night, they were 6, 6, and 5 yo at that time, and the few times we have spoken of that night again, we still remember the same, and 2 of them are reluctant to talk about it.
It was april 3rd, i remember because it was my grandmas bday. Regular autumn night. My grandparents lived in a rural area, they had a farm and some animals. Next to my grandparents house, There was a few acres of crops, and i'm the other side, one of my uncles had his house.

It was around 9.30 pm and everyone was gathered at my grandmas house enjoying the party except me and my cousins, being kids we wanted to play, run, and do kids stuff, but being autumn it was cold outside and we were not allowed to go out and play. So my uncle decides to go to his house to fetch some wine across the crop field and we asked if we could go and play There a little bit and the adults were ok with that. My uncle accompanied us and we stayed There playing in my cousins room while he went back to my grandmas. If we wanted to go back, we have to use the phone to call to grandmas and ask for one adult to come fetch us. 

I can't tell exactly how long we were There, but we started to play a game we liked, that involved turning the lights of my cousins bedroom off, and start to throw her stuffed animals (she had dozens) at the dark trying to hit each other. The rooms window panel was a little bit crooked so There was a little bit of light coming from the outside lamp. 

We were throwing toys around when my youngest cousins receives one flat in the face, she falls and hurts her head with a chair, landing right into the only part of the room where they light from outside filtered through the window. She immediatly starts crying and we gathered around her and started consolating her.

It was then when we hard a thump in the hallway and some footsteps, we were trying to make her stop crying because if an adult was There to fetch us back to the party and saw her crying we knew we were un trouble.
There was a bright light on the other side of the door and the door knob started to twist, the door then opened like an inch or two, the light on the other side was really bright, it was not the lightbulb from the hallway. My little cousin was still crying loud and the rest of us was crouching next to her at the corner of the room, wondering what was happening that no adult was coming from the semi opened door.

One of my cousins started asking whos There, thinking that maybe it was her older brother, he was 15 back then. But nobody answered. She asked again and no response. Then we all saw the same thing a small hand with long fingers grabbed the door really slowly and the door started to move, we could see half of the silhouette of that thing, standing There holding the door with one hand, peeking inside the room, with the bright light from behind. It was in no way taller than any of us kids. We started to panic and screamed at it. I'm having goosebumps all over my body as im typing this, i can't Even describe the feeling of pure, raw, fear and dread we had at that moment. It just stood There, watching us freak out and hold eachothers while screaming and crying. For a second it looked like it hesitated to go back, but then it started to open the door, always slow, we screamed Even harder. Then it took a step forward and all i could think of was to throw some stuffed animals that were laying near us, and one of my cousins joined me. So, 2 kids, 7 and 6 years old, scared to death, throwing stuffed animals across the room to whatever entity was There standing at the door. We never hitted it, in fact i don't know who, but one of us grabbed a shoe and threw it, it slammed hard on the door and made a Lot of noise, it was There the thing stopped, took a good look again of the 4 little kids screaming and crying on the corner, closed the door and left.
All we could do was hug eachothers on the corner and cry. We were to afraid to Even go close to the door to turn the lights on. We just froze There crying and sobbing, and calling for our parents through the window. No one came, and eventually the bright light on the other side disipated. I don't know how long it was, maybe 10 minutes or an hour before someone came to the house because we were taking to long, but it felt like ages. 
My 15yo cousin came looking for us and we couldnt stop crying and told him what we saw, he seemed to believe us because i remember him taking us out of There, running through the crops and back to grandmas. Every adult There laughed us off and told it was nonsense. We were really frustrated. 
We are not really sure, to this day, what we saw that night. Personally i think it was an ET, the closest i can think of as to how to describe it is those little guys from the movie close encounters, the ones that come off the ship in the end. But we couldnt actually see any facial features because of the light, just the silhouette.
Someone told me years later that maybe it was an angel (im not religious) but that wouldnt explain the deep fear and feeling of dread that thing caused.
Since that point in my life, almost 90% of my nightmares, involve semi closed doors, whenever i see then in my dreams i jump on them and try to close them while something from the other side pushes to open it, sometimes i can Even see the long fingers holding it.
Over the years, sometimes talking with my cousins, that night comes up, we still remember the same thing. But the last time, 2 of them didnt want to talk about it at all. We all agree we saw something that night and that it scared the shit out of us little kids, and it would still scare the shit out of us in our 30s."
266,Think I may have just been visited.,Abductions,14,I think we had a encounter tonight. Me and my gf was in bed. She was sleeping and I was watching TV. Our bed faces our TV and the doorway is directly to the left by about 2-3 feet. I happen to see a figure out of my peripheral and seen it was peeking in our bedroom door then I made direct eye contact and still seen it. It was about 3-4 feet tall and had really pale skin. Couldn't make out facial features due to looking at the TV in the the dark then glancing over and looking directly at it my eyes didn't have time to focus because it ran away too quickly. When it seen that I looked directly it pulled out of the doorway as if it was running away. I jumped up and ran to look for it then went to kitchen and glanced at the time on the stove and it was 3:33 AM. I must have woke my GF up because she came to the kitchen and I explained what I seen. She proceeds to tell me she seen a flash of light reflecting through the the cracks of the curtains on the wall. I head outside and didn't see anything on the ground or in the sky.

275,absolutely awful Experience from June of 2015.,Abductions,10,"   I'll try to keep this clear and concise. Back in June of 2015 I was 15 years old and my sister (3 years older) was 18 and it was the summer before she was going to head off to college. Back then all 4 of us (me, my sister, father and mother) lived in a 3 bedroom house south of Portland Oregon. 
  
   On the evening of the 26th of June 2015 (Believe it was a friday) I had been at training to be a summer camp counselor all day and after 10 hours I was exhausted. Although I was physically tired I had trouble sleeping that night since my mind was racing for some reason. After laying up in bed for a few minutes I decided I would do what I always did when I had trouble sleeping, crack open my kindle and start reading. I proceeded to get out of bed and grab my kindle and then go down stairs into the living room. For reference my parents room as well as my room is upstairs while my sisters room is downstairs near the back of the house where the stairs start. After going down the stairs I went into the kitchen to get a glass of water and then I walked to the living room to sit down on the couch, I remember opening my kindle and the time reading that it was past 23:00 hrs already but I was planing on reading until I was tired so the time didn't seem to matter to me at that moment.

   After sitting down I began reading silently on the couch in the living room. About 10 minutes after I began reading I noticed a light noise coming from the kitchen, it sounded like a person walking barefoot on a tile floor if anyone reading this has heard that before. Thinking it could have been my sister I decided that I would get up to see what she was doing out of bed so late. When I walked over to the Kitchen was when the weird stuff started happening. No one was there, at first I was confused and agitated but I reasoned that It might have just been my mind playing tricks on me. Standing there in the kitchen I felt different from how I had felt seemingly mere seconds before. For one thing I was not only more tired (physically) than I had felt at any point in that night but I was also mentally tired to the point where I just wanted to go to sleep right away. My stomach also felt slightly upset (mild but not horrible nausea)

   Feeling out of it, I decided I would go back to the couch to grab my kindle and then go to bed, but my kindle was not where I left it. At this point I started to get freaked out and went to my room, When I got into my room I looked at the red numbers on my alarm clock and I will never forget what it read, 3:32 on the dot. Unable to reconcile how 4 hours evaporated in what seemed like 15 minutes I started thinking I had gone through some kind of neurological episode or that something was wrong with my brain, I spent the rest of the morning researching what it could have been until I finally fell asleep at 7 am or so. For the next few days I acted like nothing was wrong but what had happened on the night of the 26th had deeply bothered me to the point that I worked out the courage to talk to my sister about it nearly a week later.

   The moment I mentioned what happened on the night of the 26th to my sister all the normal joviality of her personality ceased in an instant. On her face was an amalgamation of emotions that I have yet to see again, there was anger, frustration, fear, anxiety and even some sadness on her face. I remembered that she looked over my shoulder to make sure my parents weren't around and she started to tell me that she's been having weird experiences similar in nature to the one I had experiences a week earlier since she was 13. Red geometric dots on her wrists, behind her ears and around her abdomen as well as missing time, items that had been moved inexplicably around the house and especially scary, she had *On more than one occasion, including the night of the 26th (the same night as my freaky experience)* woken up with her pajama pants and underwear on inside out. It was after talking with my sister in july of 2015 that I started to research abductions and it sank it that not only is my sister likely being routinely taken in the night by those disgusting things ,but that I was likely taken as well on that one instance. 

Because of this I have suffered for paranoia and constant anxiety about being abducted again, It got to the point were I was taking extra strength sleep aids to make sure I could sleep and that I was locking my bedroom door at night even though it was only my sister and parents at home. Although those disgusting creatures find locks not to be a barrier what so ever, it is more of a mental coping mechanism. Since my sister left for college and has now since graduated she had been reluctant to talk of her experiences in the past but she has mentioned to me that once she and her boyfriend moved in together that it has largely stopped.

   No matter how much I want to forget, there is a part of me that wants to do hypnotic regression therapy even though I'm terrified of what I might see and don't want to relive the experience a second time."

I grew up hearing about my parents' UFO encounter long before I was born with a huge circular UFO on the Natchez Trace while driving through Mississippi.  My dad said it was over a field and that he could see things in the windows and multicolored lights going around the top and bottom of the craft in different color patterns.  They couldn't make out any details on the bottom of the craft, but he said it blocked out the stars and that he thought it was probably only about 100 feet or so up and probably the size of 2 football fields.  He had stopped the car, because he wanted to watch it.  My mother became frightened when the UFO started coming towards the car and made him get back in.  My oldest sister was a baby (now in her 50's), so this has been a long time ago.

&#x200B;

I share this just to give a little of my background.  I grew up loving Star Trek, Star Wars, reading Sci Fi books, and later UFO books.  I also had recurring dreams as a child of seeing what looked like an Armada of different spacecraft and then later in the dream, looking down onto rolling hills from inside one of the crafts.  I always took this as a dream and nothing more, but I don't know anymore.

&#x200B;

I woke up about a week ago at around 2:20am, still with my sleep mask on and earplugs in (this is how I normally sleep).  I couldn't move at all and I had the strangest feeling across my entire body that I have ever felt.  It felt as if my body was being pulled up by something.  It was almost like the feeling of suction, but very strong and full of vibration.  This happened for what must have been 30-45 seconds, but it felt like eternity, because I had no control.  Then, suddenly, I could move everything again, and I pulled up my sleep mask.  I was in bed alone.  I had goosebumps everywhere and my arm hair was standing up.  I remember reading about astral projection when I was younger and even trying it (without success).  So, I thought maybe this was what I had experienced.

&#x200B;

Then, a few nights ago, I woke up with a throbbing ring finger on my right hand.  It felt like the tip of my finger had been slammed in a car door.  My fingernail and the finger underneath were both extremely painful and sensitive, but with no bruising that I could see.  Then, the night before last, I woke up with a triangular bruise on my left forearm.  I know for a fact I did not go to bed with this bruise, and it's very painful, when I press on it (I'll attach a picture).

&#x200B;

If it were just these things, I still honestly might not attribute it to anything supernatural or extraordinary, but I have been practicing meditation over the past 6 months or so, and when I meditate before bed, I now always see the faces of what look like grays peering down at me, almost as if from above.  The first time this happened, I thought I was losing it, and it still startles me every time, because this seems to happen when my mind is completely empty of thoughts in meditation, and it feels like it is coming from outside my mind (if that makes sense?), almost as if I am communicating with something.

&#x200B;

I honestly don't know what to think of all of this, but I feel almost afraid to go to bed now.  I'm hoping others may have had similar experiences and can share.  I guess right now, I just need to know that I'm not alone in this.  Thank you for listening and thank you in advance for sharing your stories."
278,I tried to punch an alien in the face,Abductions,6,"&#x200B;

Now, you may think I'm joking, or that this is a troll, but it certainly felt very real to me: even if I don't think it's a big deal if it IS real. In the end I just wanna get it off my chest to see if it helps anybody, or something.

&#x200B;

Anyway, to add context to this so that you approach this with A LOT of salt, I fancy myself as an artistic visionary. I've had quite a few insane, vivid dreams over the years, most of which have absolutely nothing to do with aliens, and I think about imaginary scenarios for my intellectual properties all day long. I also tend to get sugar highs, and go off on existential and inspirational escapades: the outlet primarily being artwork and writing.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, I've always thought about the cosmic, and how we apply to it in many different, and nihilistic ways: including a myriad of questions and scenarios about how real aliens would interact with us, and to what extent I could push the boundaries of Humanity's narrative power opposed to the actual, uncontrollable reality such beings would likely pose.

&#x200B;

Not to mention I've always personally feared aliens ever since I was a child: you know, having potential experiences with them, even though I never did. Paranoia. You can blame shows like Ancient Aliens on fucking History Channel, or choice documentaries on other channels for that kind of terror shit. Especially John Carpenter's The Thing, which I watched like 10 to 20 consecutive times when I was an early teenager. I haven't seen it since then on principle because of the nightmares, and my vivid recollection of it I'd rather let dull (I'm 23 now).

&#x200B;

So it's safe to say I'm not an outlier, nor innocent of mind from this. In fact, I probably could've come up with a similar scenario on multiple occasions. And when you add on the anticipation of such an event occurring, you would think that would just cause the dream to happen. I'm honestly surprised it took this long really, since it's been a chronic fear since childhood. Tbh, I kinda feel like the person(s) Maynard's talking about on Rosetta Stoned by the band Tool lol.

&#x200B;

But here it is anyway, for those that want it:

&#x200B;

A couple months ago this year (2019), I ""wake up"" to the classic dreamy haze. It's not particularly vivid, but I certainly remember the actual dream itself. Save for certain elements.

&#x200B;

So I wake up in a totally white expanse. I think I'm standing on a floor, but there's no way to tell, it's just too white. There's this blurry guy next to me, a Human. I don't know if he's wearing clothes or not. He's telling me that I'm not gonna like this, but he needs to show me something. Now, I don't recall getting a good look at him, but I vaguely think he had true brown hair, and was kinda tan. Togusa from Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex comes to mind, though with shorter hair. After he says what I recall, I don't remember him saying anything else, or doing anything else: he just needs to show me something.

&#x200B;

I turn, and look over to my right, and... There's 2 of them. One of them standing in front of the other right in front of me, facing me directly: the one behind a little off to the left, and the one in front slightly off to the right. They're not blurry. Actually, I recall exactly what they look like.

&#x200B;

They're both Greys a little shorter than me, maybe a foot or half a foot. Their eyes are pitch black semi vertical seed shapes, classic: not shiny at all though. Their heads are not spherical, but like as if a Human head has its jaw elongated downward while the skull casing is higher in elevation. Obviously bald. Strangely handsome looking, but at the same time utterly uncanny valley. However, it's clear to me their heads overall are massive, bigger than mine. Also, their noses appear to be strangely Human-like, and their bodies are slim with shoulders ending a little after the jawline, but not overtly small: actually they're a little chunky in the gut region, which I'm not sure is lighter than the surrounding skin. Their overall skin is pure light grey/gray.

&#x200B;

The second I see them, I feel a drop in my stomach: a sense of pure, unadulterated dread. They're both looking right at me. They don't speak, but they both seem to be frowning, with maybe slightly angry brow lines, and I get a sensation that they're VERY threatening. I get the feeling they're going to do something terrible to me.

&#x200B;

The dream ends when I quickly lurch forward flexing my right arm, and go to punch the Grey on the right in between the eyes: which I remember my fist getting very close, if not right on it. I don't know if it truly connected.

&#x200B;

After that, I don't know what happened. I wake up for real, and honestly only feel terror for like a minute before I get up, and look out my window at the night: starting to view it as a rather beneficial oddity of perspective. Which I still believe.

&#x200B;

On one half, even though I think it's probably just a nightmare, the implication of it being real makes it a very humbling thing. Cosmic bullshit that could kill all of us, you know the drill with all of that. I've known about those things for a long time now. But this in particular, if it IS real, it just proves to me that we're all just shit out of luck late to the race. Enjoy it while it lasts.

&#x200B;

On the other half, the matter of me actually retaliating instead of being truly powerless perhaps posing a different message entirely. Or maybe it's just fleeting flails of a doomed race.

&#x200B;

Ultimately though, I feel like whatever, walk circles around me like adults around a toddler, not like I can do anything about it. If they're real, then they're just a bunch of lousy, elitist bullies who think they can walk all over us, fuck em.

&#x200B;

Anyway, that's it. I can try and give more context if y'all want, but I really can't remember anything else about the dream, sorry. Also, sorry if this isn't the usual scenario, this is just something that happened to me.

&#x200B;

Edit 1:

\- Sorry for any grammatical or structural errors, I typed this up on my glitchy phone: making an edit on my PC now. I only changed some misspelled words, and fixed the Togusa part of the blurry man's description (dunno why half the sentence went to the next line).

\- To add context for why I decided to post this, I actually woke up from a pseudo sleep paralysis nightmare earlier in the night. A nightmare about me in a dark house trying to sleep in various rooms while fearing a dark entity coming to get me from the closets. Not really anything to do with aliens, but I have read about the witching hour of the night, and I tend to stay up past 3am out of superstition. Afterwards, going to bed with ease. And about the whole ""abduction stigma"" thing, and why I decided to wait until NOW to post... I just forgot about it. And honestly, I don't care about stigmas, if anyone has a problem then they can go fuck off. I'm not the type to wave off things like this as crazy talk, nor am I the type to truly believe in it: I'm just open-minded about it.

\- The main reason for the Edit is a bit of info I actually just remembered about the dream, despite what I said about not remembering anything else about the dream. It's not much though, more about the reaction I had upon seeing the aliens. After reading through this a few times, I get the impression from my own impression that it may come off like I was unusually brave in the face of their opposition, which I STRONGLY would like to correct. It's a very strange feeling, but in the moment it felt something ENTIRELY unlike bravery.

\- When the blurry man told me he wanted to show me something, the transition from me to seeing the aliens was very quick: I was turning casually after all. But upon seeing them in full, you could say it was a lot like a horror movie jump-scare in ideal, though in that moment I did not jump. I do think I was slightly startled though, and I remember a sensation of the light somehow getting brighter despite the light already being bright. And when I did see them, I remember just a sheer... There was a very quick disbelief at what I'm seeing alive right before me, but then immediately a core, just crushing realization that it's real. A kind of visceral fear without adverse reaction, being in a kind of situation where YOU'RE subject: like a terrorist seeing you, though I've never been in that kind of situation. I just stood there, staring at them, and I remember my expression being completely blank from fathoming what I'm seeing. They're fucking standing there, REAL aliens, looking at me, completely out in the open clear as day to see. And I do indeed remember the sensation of there being sound, even if there wasn't any noticeable sound other than the blurry man talking to me. But when I saw those aliens, I remember a dead silence. It was extremely silent. And that moment seemed to last for at least 2-3 seconds before I did anything. It was still far too long, however.

\- And to add onto the punch, I think it might of been flight or fight rather than purely cognizant. Not sure about it, it just happened. I've on occasion had dreams about trying to punch things, feeling my punches being really weak. But in this scenario, I went to punch with REAL oomph."

281,Not sure if there could be any relation but..,Abductions,3,"So I’ve always been interested in the topic of aliens since I was a child.. so has my dad and even my nan. I’ve seen stuff in the sky before but I’ve never really had any crazy possible abduction stories but I was thinking that it could’ve possibly happened. Every time I’ve been on holiday with my parents, the security systems always beep me and my dad without fail. Never do I have any metal on me at all and neither has my dad and the weird thing is it’s only started to happen for the past 5 years (with me not my dad) I never used to get beeped at all. I’ve not looked into abductions much or the idea of being probed but could it be possible? Me and my friend were followed by an object in the sky once so I have had weird encounters but I don’t know.."
282,My story. anyone relate?,Abductions,12,"First off I would like to say yes, I do have panic disorder and ptsd. I developed ptsd from a traumatic event that took place when I was 4 years old. I strongly disbelieve that my dreams or encounters are from that, however the dreams or abductions maybe make it worse at times. Anyway, as a young child I remember being terrified of the wind, constant dreams of flying, strange lights coming through my window, and even bright lights looking down at my face while sleeping. I had these psychic abilities and premonitions that I'd warn people about that my parents were baffled by, because they all came true. My parents had a difficult time putting me to bed. I remember coming clean with my father telling him such things like ""They're coming"". I remember him reading Bible verses in my room. As I grew into a teenager and still had these issues, he said ""What makes you so important that if they existed, they would come to you?"". It sounded harsh but true to me. I grew drained of trying to explain to anyone. I remember having repeated dreams of the same house, like a maze filled with trap doors and different escape options. I knew each time I had this dream, it was a test. It always up felt like they were testing me. Up until this day, I still have this dream. Same house, different options. I feel this scared sensation, this buzzing, vibrating, humming noise that only I can hear in my body. And that's how I know that they're close or coming. I started to see them in things I looked at. Their faces. It would send a feeling of my heart dropping into my stomach. I felt ""watched"". When I would forcefully say to myself ""I'm sick, I'm ill"" very rarely would I experience anything to do with them, like they were afraid of sickness, and I was also relieved when it would rain, a silly thought that they never show up when it's raining for some reason. I would move to different locations and it would take a few months for the sensations to start up. I always felt like I was being tracked. My first sight of one was when I was a child, I was asleep, and I awoke to a horrible smell and one standing beside me in a bright white room, it was tall, darker skin than my future encounters. I couldn't move to see but it's torso to the bottom of its chin. In my head I heard an order to ""close my eyes"". Which I always have, and when I wake up, I have this feeling of just loss, or being lost. Similar to a few years ago I awoke to seeing nothing but light infront of a being. I could feel myself panic and it said ""You are fine. Close your eyes and you will be back."" all in my head. They terrify me, yes. But for some reason, when I catch them enough to remember, it's like they know when I'm panicking, and offer me a type of reassurance. The encounters that I do remember, they're not hurtful or violating. But they leave an impression. To me they're short memories in gaps. I often times want to know more of my memories, but am too afraid. I haven't experienced anything that I remember for nearly a year."
283,I think I was abducted?,Abductions,9,"I wasn’t really involved much in the alien scene and were terrified of the things when I was a kid. When I was fourteen, I had sleep paralysis but woke up and around the bed were four typical greys. The window was open and a big light was coming through. I got this hard fear before getting what felt like, forced to sleep. I woke up later and told my parents and they laughed so I didn’t mention it again. 
Then I moved away and I got sleep paralysis again, and when I opened my eyes I remember something being in the dark room. I remember feeling like my legs were being spread and something being shoved into my body; I think my eggs were perhaps taken? I had serious cramps the next day and my whole body hurt. 
Since, nothings really happened but just wanted to share it."
284,June 2001 UFO experience,Abductions,29,"I posted this originally in the UFOs sub, but that place seems like it is just for sightings. I think this was more... Please read on.

I was driving cross-country with a friend, and witnessed some very unusual lights. This was in the prairies, just outside Saskatoon on Highway 16 heading east.

I had pulled over to the side of the road to take a break from driving, it was very early in the morning. There was a highway interchange some distance behind me, a hundred meters I guess. While I was relaxing and discussing the drive with my friend, I had a car pull up behind me. I could see it was a Police cruiser and it turned on its lights just before a uniformed officer exited and came up to my window. 

Usual license and registration (I hope there isn't a file on this somewhere). Basically, I was told that it was not safe for me to be pulled over off the highway here to rest from my long haul driving, and that I should proceed to the next town and get a motel or at least a parking lot to rest up in. He made a strange comment about knowing the neighborhood I was from, like he had lived there or been there. I am from a small town, very far away from Saskatoon, another province. Weird coincidence? I thought so, he was kind of intimidating but not outright threatening. I was 18, so I just did as I was told and got my car moving. The police officer pulled a 180 and headed back to Saskatoon, I assumed.

So I was driving again, and it was a few minutes later and I noticed an orange light out to the right of my vehicle. There was just farmland on either side of the highway, and the light was far away. I tried to examine it as I drives and it looked like it was some kind of illuminated structure. Sort of squat and cylindrical with a convex outer wall, some spots lighter shade in color. It seemingly was a complicated thing. I remember wondering if it was sitting on top of a hill or tower, but it was so dark I could not see. The object was pretty much motionless at its height, sometimes it seemed brighter, other times a dull glow. 

We discussed the oddity of it as we drove past. I think I made some spooky comments to unnerve my friend, but ahead there were more lights. Two of them, I think or maybe the same one twice.

I notice a light on the opposite side of the highway first, and pulled over to observe it. There was an old rundown wooden structure and a large tree that was somewhat obstructing a clear view of this light. This light seemed to be a light blue, and I only caught a momentary glimpse of it before it disappeared from view. I couldn't tell if it was the tree or the building or what, I remember intently focusing on the area, but the light did not emerge as I expected it would. 

Looking around, I saw another (or maybe the same?) light in the empty field on my side of the highway this time. I also checked for the orange object, and it was no longer where expected. This new object, orb-like, floated maybe twenty feet above the ground and illuminated the grass below it in it pale blue light. It moved back and forth, and I got the impression that it was looking for something. It's wierd to assume, it's just that if I was looking for something that I only had a general idea of its location, I would search in this back and forth pattern that I saw it move in.

Unfortunately, I took this as my call to adventure. I suggested that we check it out, which of course my passenger was firmly against. She did not like the idea one bit, but I convinced her that I would be okay. There was a small service road just ahead that joined the highway. It was just big enough to pull my car on to comfortably and so I moved up to it and pulled off the road, facing the fence and gate where the road met the field.

It was very early dawn, twilight. The light was in the field. I exited my car, friend reluctantly accompanies me in my idiotic quest.

This was a big fucking field mind you and the object wasn't as close as I had initially assessed. The ground was also uneven, undulating, rippled. I guess that's what happens when grass grows back over a plowed field? In any case, it slowed our progress toward the light. We walked steadily toward it, not speaking. Maybe less than ten minutes. I think I became confused.

The next thing I remember was that we were exiting the field walking back toward my car. It seemed to be a mechanical and robotic directive. Just get back to car, get in car. No other thoughts contradicted this objective. Daylight had dawned, we sat in my car and I turned the ignition. I struggled to read the clock's red digital display. I couldn't make sense of the numbers. I realized that something was wrong.

Well several things. Firstly, I was overcome with panic and dread. I had no recollection of what happened in the field. Similarly, my companion could not account for her time. We struggled to communicate with each other, but in time came to our senses somewhat. I was able to read my clock again, and it appeared roughly an hour and a half had passed. My throat felt like it had been scraped raw, and it hurt to speak and swallow. My friend complained of abdominal discomfort (she would later discover that she was menstruating unexpectedly and with alarming volume). The gate was gone? So was the wooden building across the highway, and the tree, and the interchange that I expected to see far in the distance back the way we supposedly came.

Panic gripped me and I felt that we had to get the hell out of there. I cannot say where we were, for sure, only that it was not Highway 16. As we fled, we did not immediately come to the conclusion that we were displaced but as the highway stretched on with no signs or markers if upcoming stops, it really began to sink in that we were lost.

A vehicle MENACED us. I have no other way to describe it. It was a pickup truck and it drove crazy down the oncoming stretch if road, and then pulled around behind us crossing a grassy median to get to our side of the four lane highway. Even though I was driving flat out, it easily gained on me and rode close to my rear bumpers before aggressively passing me. Once it got far enough ahead, it whipped back around and repeated this intimidating display, circling around and bearing down on us once more. I couldn't make out the occupants, but it was scary as fuck.

So we drove on terrified, not knowing what occurred, where we were, or who was after us. My old classic-era Nokia cell phone's battery was long dead. We drove on for what seemed like forever, I was still having a lot of trouble comprehending the passage of time. 

We eventually found a tiny rest stop on this road with an old diner and a boarded up A&W. We had breakfast, the few people inside eyed us strangely. The clock never changed in there, the orange juice burned my throat. We were scared to ask many questions, but determined that we were now headed toward Regina by talking to the waitress.

After we left there was a other strange occurrence where an oncoming vehicle lost control in front of us, crossed the median and then jumped our side of the highway. Nobody was hurt, just a bunch of twenty something Asian kids on drugs. The driver had passed out and pissed himself. I offered help, but they refused.

We ended up in Regina hours later, I remember thinking that we were being followed. In Regina we slept in my car, in a truck stop parking lot for a full day. We were both feeling very unwell.

I don't know what happened in that field, nothing good."
285,Abduction?? Let me know what you think,Abductions,6,"         So this started happening when I was around 17 and persisted for a few months, still happens sporadically. I only remember one instance very vividly the rest seem to have faded out of my memory (I’m 19 now). I know that it persisted for a while because I remember the conversations I had with friends, family, and even my English teacher; who recommended I see a doctor. 
        From what I remember it starts with me lying in bed at some point in the night. I then feel like my body is vibrating in a rhythmic fashion, not just random pulsating. I’m being pulled from my bed to somewhere and then it’s over and I wake up. When it first started I was terrified and after a few instances I started telling people. I researched to see what was happening and I came to the conclusion it was sleep paralysis. 
         Time goes on and my experiences persist but something changes. I’m not scared anymore. I have this weird feeling that no harm is coming to me and I’m ok with whatever is happening. I read posts about people’s horrible abduction stories but something in me suggests that harm is not the intention: knowledge is. I start wanting it to happen because I feel like I’m being given something. 
          Or it could be sleep paralysis and I’m imagining it all. Everyone wants to feel important, like they are special and chosen. Maybe my mind is manifesting these thoughts to make me feel important. I honestly don’t know. I wish I kept a journal of when this happened to me so I could somehow make sense of it. The unusual thing is how often it use to happen and I can only remember one specific occurrence. I can only remember the feelings afterward and the conversations. 
           Let me know what you think."
286,Alien Abduction Case of Betty Andreasson,Abductions,2,0
287,My experiences,Abductions,14,"I don’t know, I just feel like talking about it tonight but can’t tell anyone in person. I’m in my early 30s now and have spent the majority of my life trying to figure out what was wrong with me and unraveling this hidden mystery in my life. 

I guess most of this might be hard to believe, but it just is what it is. 

I was sheltered as a child, homeschooled, no cable or anything. So no exposure to anything pop culture including aliens, therefore nothing that could have influenced thoughts or perceptions related to this. 
  
At this point in time I think I must have started experiencing what is considered an alien abduction experience at a young age and I think it only got serious when I started puberty -- got my period at age 11.

I only started putting together the alien connection in my late 20s, until that point I just privately anguished over unexplainable memories, missing chucks of my childhood, other things. 

Okay, so, when I was around 11 or 12, I noticed a blood blister type of thing near my knee and assumed I fell on a rock or something while rollerblading and promptly forgot about it. Every now and again over the following months, I noticed that it was still there. It was dark purple and red, about the diameter of a US dime coin or a bit smaller, and never hurt even when I poked at it. 

One day I was bored, I decided to pop it and squeeze the blood out so it could heal. I was able to easily break the skin over it just by pinching at it with my nails and it peeled off easily, almost like a blister. That's when I saw that it was actually a deep hole in my leg with some blood pooled in the bottom.

When I wiped the blood out, I saw a dark circle and thought a small rock had gotten embedded in my leg and that's why it didn't heal. Well, I eventually was able to grab it with my nails and pulled it out. It wasn't a rock, it was a long super sharp metal cone. Solid black, about an inch long, very slight ribbing on it like deck nails have to keep them from wiggling out of the wood. 

I was shocked to put it mildly. This thing was insanely sharp but indestructible. I stabbed stuff with it and tried to break it but I couldn't even dull it. I eventually took it home to show mom and she didn't believe I pulled it out of my leg until I showed her the hole by my knee. Then she eventually told me she didn't know what it was and gave it back to me. 

When I got bored with it, I tossed it in the weeds and went back to playing.

I forgot all about it until about four weeks later when I turned the leg that had the spike to the side, the light cast a shadow where I saw that suddenly I had what looked like a deep bow shaped scar where the spike had been. 

The spike had been only about the diameter of pencil lead and was sharp, so it didn't cause a big mark on the skin. The scab had healed quickly. But now I had this big wide surgically precise scar fully healed out of nowhere in the exact same spot.

There's a pic of what it looks like today. Black and White because it shows up better with the contrast. After twenty years, it has gotten a bit less deep and precise, but still largely looks unchanged. I have never been able to explain how it got there.

When I was around 13, I started waking up feeling like shit, for lack of a better explanation. I stopped telling my parents because nothing was ever wrong and I'd feel fine by lunch time, so I was accused of faking. 

Well, one day I woke up feeling extra shit. I felt terribly depressed for no good reason, my stomach hurt, head hurt, body ached. I thought I was going to be sick and went into the bathroom. My lower stomach hurt like bad cramps and I thought maybe I was getting my period. 

I tried to put a tampon in but couldn't. So I felt in my vagina (which had been evaluated in my first brief gyno exam not too long before all this as totally healthy) and long story short, somehow over night I had gone from healthy to having a stage 3 uterine prolapse. That means the uterus was all the way to the vagina opening, stage 4 is when it's outside the body. 

No doctor has ever been able to explain how this happened. I've been told it is basically unprecedented. This type of prolapse is only seen in kids who have birth defects, which I didn't. It's basically only seen in older women who had given birth multiple times during their life. A couple doctors didn't even believe my story because they said there's just no way it could happen overnight like that, that it didn't even make sense.

There were a lot of things during those years. My only friend was a boy who lived two houses down. Well, I had these ""dreams"" that involved him that lasted a couple years when I'd have been around 6 to 8. Literally one day in my early twenties, I randomly thought about them and had a ""holy shit!"" Moment when I realized how ducked up they were. 

Basically, when I was a kid, I'd have what I for some reason had thought was a dream even though I felt wide awake and lucid. It was fucked so warning. I remember on many occasions just sitting at the back of a gray room that for some reason I thought was my friends living room even though at the same time I could plainly see it wasn't. 

I'd sit there quiet and watch as he was on a metal basically angled hospital bed and someone was using medical instruments on his genitals and stomach. It was silent. I didn't feel fear, it never occurred to me to talk or even think about the situation, I was perfectly content just sitting there. 

For whatever reason, I had the idea that the person who was messing with him was his mom even though it wasnt. My brain couldn't seem to put those two pieces of info together even though I was aware of both facts separately. 

He was awake and seemed kind of out of it, he never spoke or reacted and didn't seem distressed. The person messing with him had a platter next to him with instruments on it. I can still see this entire scene so clearly in my mind. I remember one instrument was like a handheld with a long thin wire that was inserted into the boy's body. 

He was hooked up to hoses that I'd thought of as IVs. I remember that the wire instrument was inserted into his penis and at some point into his stomach. I remember a hose or thicker wire type thing was inserted up his anus at some point. I remember very long needles, fluids being taken in tubes about the size of fingers and those being sat on a tray.  I remember one big needle being put into his upper abdomen area.

At some point while watching this, I'd just realize I was lying flat on my back in bed staring at the underside of the upper bunk and what I was watching would suddenly be a scene in my head and I had the strong idea that this was just a daydream and that it was time to go to sleep. I never felt fear, never thought about it during the day, never brought it up to the boy.  It never seemed odd. 

Now, of course as an adult, all I could say was what the actual absolute fuck. Keep in mind, I was homeschooled with helicopter parents, I wasnt even allowed inside this boy's house without my parents there and also I had zero exposure to media or sexual things of any nature. So how the hell was I ""dreaming"" such realistic, detailed, fucked up things that I shouldn't have even had the knowledge to dream about?

When I was 14, my brain broke for lack of a better explanation. I also remember that clear as day. I went into my room to work on a hobby that used to bring me so much joy. I sat at my desk, turned on my boom box, and then sat there feeling empty in a way I couldn't understand. I just suddenly felt stripped on my emotional depth. 

It's hard to explain. It wasn't like depression or anything. It was totally neutral. It was the absence of something I couldn't even remember. The project was of no interest to me. Working on it felt like nothing. The music playing felt like nothing. I sat there staring straight ahead trying to understand what was going on. I couldn't understand why I felt nothing at all. 

Eventually I put away the project, turned off the music, and thought maybe I'd be back to normal the next day. That was 17 years ago. Nothing has changed. 

I am no longer a whole person. As of that day, I have had aphantasia. I literally cannot visualize a single image in my head even though before that time, I could watch movies in my head if I wanted. I can't even remember what it's like to be able to see images in my head.

The world is flat. I have not felt passion for anything once since that day. Not like depression. I haven't been depressed for years, in fact I can feel joy and happiness in a roundabout way now, but it's not the same. Like, I can watch something funny, I can laugh, I can be all the “normal” things, yet there's something missing. 

This caused me huge distress in my late teens and early 20s because back then, I could still remember what it felt like to be normal, and every day I was acutly aware that _something_ in me was missing. Oh God, I wanted it back so bad, but I couldn't even understand what it was. 

I think it doesn't distress me now because it has been so long I can no longer remember what it's like to be whole. I can no longer remember what I'm missing. Still, I know it's gone.

During my late teens and most of my 20s, I meditated extensively. Sometimes for several hours a day. I wanted so desperately to fix myself. Well, one day amid this deep meditation, I suddenly became aware of a part of my mind that I realized had always been there but that somehow I didn't notice until that moment. 

It's so hard to explain, but it's like there's a partition in my mind that I can reach out and touch but not access. I know for a fact that the missing part of myself is in that partition, but so is something I can't remember. That, I've become certain, I'm not supposed to remember. I've become positive this part of my mind was deliberaly, against all logic, somehow sealed off from my conscious access. 

I have tried to force myself into it. That is a bad idea. If I start trying to forcefully connect with this part of my own damn mind, almost immediately all the muscles in my torso lock up. If I don't stop, it's like something gets triggered in my brain and I start losing my ability to speak. 

It's literally as if my ability to communicate with the world gets knocked out if I come anywhere close to accessing this part of my mind. First my jaw will clench. Then if I try to talk, my mind will just lock up and I can't speak. Literally just go straight up mute. I've fought against this as hard as possible and the most I could get out was a few words with a terrible stutter.  It feels like forgetting how to speak. I can't form words even in my head. 

If I keep fighting against this, it's basically like short circuiting. My teeth will start to chatter, my hands will tremble, my head will start jerking to the side rapidly, my torso muscles will squeeze so hard I'll struggle to breathe, I won't even be able to form language in my head, a feeling of utter anguish will fill me, and then just when I think I wont be able to handle it, something will literally feel like it releases inside me. 

When that happens, it's as if my brain is rebooted. I'll feel as if I just woke up. All muscle tension will be gone. I'll instantly be able to talk again. The entire day up until that moment will feel like a foggy dream, I'll barely be able to rememver what I was doing before that. 

I've come to hate this. It sincerely feels like a defense mechanism in my own mind that is doing everything possible to keep me from accessing that partition in my own mind even to the extreme of making me incapable of speaking and then, if I don't stop pushing, just purging the cache and rebooting my mind  entitely. 

I still meditate. I no longer try to access that part of my mind. I'm more aware of it than ever. I could reach out and touch it if I wanted, but I no longer try because it's just fruitless, pointless pain. But I wish to God I could remember what is hidden in there. 

There's many other things but this is already so long. I have brief unexplained memories. I remember clear as day being in my favorite pet store as a kid and a man coming out from the back room and taking my hand. He asked if I wanted to go in the back and see more animals. None of this struck me as odd for some reason. 

When we went in the back, I remember the thick bright green light, so thick it was somehow tangible in the air kind of like a laser. I remember seeing a big upright tube kind of thing, and then the memory distorts badly and basically my mind will start looping and not working right, it's my single clearest memory of the green light, but I have a less clear second memory of it. 

I will randomly have flashes sometimes of odd things I can't explain. Like in Ralph Wrecks the Internet, the scene where he gets lifted up by light in the modem to get whisked into the internet, a wave of total familiarity washed over me and I had the clearest thought, “I know what it feels like to float like that.” But I have no idea why. 

There's more but I'll stop there. 

Honestly, I try not to think about it, but some days I just want to know so badly. I feel like I had my life stolen from me. I have no passion, can't truly feel properly, I can't remember what it feels like to be whole. I feel like a puppet going through life properly, I seem normal to everyone around me, I make good money, have a decent home, but ultimately I have no true sense of self or identity. 

I'd give up everything I have to access that sealed part of my mind."

293,Likely sleep paralysis but part of me wonders if it was a abduction,Abductions,8,"I was about 15 and living about 45 min outside
NYC on Long Island 
It was winter time I think or at least very cold that night 

My childhood house was 2 Stories with the second story sitting back so you could legit climb out my window and sit on the roof or someone could climb up and into the second floor etc 

 I was sleeping facing the wall on my side with my hands tucked up by my face. I “woke up” to what I thought was a blast of cold air on my back as if someone opened the window.  I know it was wintertime or at least fall and Very cold so I would not have opened the window.
I remember thinking the clock said 3am.

As I was now “awake” i wanted  to know who the hell opened the window but I could NOT move or turn around to see it. I remember I could move my eyes and fingers and that’s it. 

I remember the cold air getting more powerful and the sound of something stepping into the room. 

At the Time I was heavy into karate classes and tried to get my hands into fists, thinking you need to be able to turn, slam your fist into whatever this is, then run to parents. I kept thinking that over and over. 

Then I felt like whatever it was got into the bed with me cause I could feel that sensation of the mattress moving cause something else was in or standing on the bed.
 I kept thinking it was getting closer and I still couldn’t move so I started to panic and recall beginning to try and pinch my hands since my fingers could move to wake myself up. 

Then I got the feeling I could move so I think I turned slamming my fist into the bed or just turned fast
nothing was there.

I think I fell out of bed or jumped out and I turned on the light. Yep nothing

I went to my door with the intention of running to parents but my childhood dog was there at the door alerted.  She was an female German Shepard and I remember her running around the room as if she was looking for something, scratching at closet door so she could look in. 

Then for some reason I got back into bed and left my dog in the room.  I woke up with her still in room next day. 

And that’s all I remember

1. What makes me think possibly just a god damn awful dream is I used to also have an issue with sleep walking as a teen.
Waking up all over the house, basement, kitchen by the front door by the back door, Put on shoes, etc so I had sleep issues 🤷🏻‍♀️
2. and that i never did run to my parents.

What is the real part that scares me and makes me wonder is I DID the next day have red marks all over my hands that my mom questioned. 
And the dog running around the room as if in search of something and she kept looking. Plus she HATED sleeping in anyone’s bedroom for longer then a few hours without starting to whine.  her spot was top of stairs or next to front door for her whole doggy life.

So I have no idea. My mom believed me cause she had similar experiences but again sure could be sleep issues I inherited. 

I’m a big paranormal and UFO believer that was one of the situations that got me into it. But again could just be cause I believe in the stuff."

295,Recalling an Experience from Childhood,Abductions,23,"Not sure if this belongs here, but I haven't found another sub where people openly share these types of experiences. While this sub focuses on the third and fourth kinds of experiences with these things, mine is about an encounter of the first kind.


I grew up in rural Colorado. One of my friends had a sleepover and we were all laying out on the trampoline admiring the night sky. I took for granted the visibility and expanse of what I could see, because that's all I knew. Today, If I were to try to look at he sky with the intention of getting the same view I had from childhood, I would have to travel to some very rural or wilderness type terrain.


We laid there that night looking at the stars and not only recognizing but being able to tell the difference between the satellites and the stars and planets. Parents called the kids to go inside. The other kids were preoccupied with ice cream and starting a movie inside, but while I laid there gazing at the milky way, I saw what clearly was a battle happening far off. I am unable to know how far away it actually was. Seeing the beams of light and things moving around so swiftly made me feel like a crazy person. They even had opposing color schemes. I know it sounds too perfect to be real. One side had red colors, the other green. 


Whether or not children are capable of visualizing things from their imagination would be relevant here, but there was never a time in my childhood where I was able to create a reality from my own wishes or desires. What I saw surprised, shocked and scared me. 


I've not shared this experience with anyone because I don't have much information. I assume people will want to know more. All I can say is that I saw a star wars battle. For years I've put it out of my mind because it's too insane to be true. I've maintained my fascination with extraterrestrials and what this all is. Only recently has this memory resurfaced and I've decided to ask others with experiences of their own what they think.


I'm fortunate, as far as I know, to not be victimized by these things and for that I am grateful. I've heard real life stories from family who have been abducted and shown me their scars. Although I have friends and family who believe I also have friends and family who strongly disagree with any UFO phenomenon. Why does this have to be so hard?"

300,Here's my real story. Fuck it.,Abductions,45," 

 I am 27 years old and I have been abducted by ""aliens"".  


My story begins in what was my studio apartment at the time. The location is in Tucson, Arizona. I was 24 years old  


I am afraid to tell you my story. For my own reasons. But I feel like I have to.   


It was an ordinary night. I was going to bed. I had on my television that was playing an audio book from my local library. When all of a sudden the power went out. I didn't think too much of it because it was a shit neighborhood in South Tucson. So I waited for the power to come back on. Eventually it did. But something was wrong I couldn't tell what it was, so I just went to bed while the audiobook played.   
This is where the abduction begins. The next thing I know I am floating up into the sky. I look down and I see the roof to my studio and my adjoining neighbor is gone. Not gone just 'pushed'. It was a portal. They had separated the matter, stretched it into a circle in order to get me out. When I was high enough the portal closed and it made a sound. A sound I can't really explain but I can mimic. When the portal closed everything looked fine. Not a hair was out of place.   


As I'm floating I am looking around the neighborhood. I've never seen it from that high up in my life. I look up to see what's pulling me in. It's an enormous, circular spaceship. It's so enormous that it reminds me of Star Wars.   


I pass out. When I come to I feel like I'm dreaming but I'm not because my hand is grabbing something and I know it's real. I'm laying face down on a foreign floor. The best way I can describe it is one of those gates they use to protect closed shops.   
But the one I'm laying on is much, much thicker and stronger. When I open my eyes, I see one of them staring at me. It's a tiny little grey alien with a big head and LARGE black eyes. It has no nose or mouth and I realize that they don't eat. It's body is tiny, so tiny they have small torsos and string like arms and legs. their fingers are longish and slim. I realize why: so they can survive long term with no gravity. How can they develop any muscles, etc, in an environment with no gravity?  


As soon as I realize what has happened that I have been abducted. I immediately go into a blind rage. I go on all fours and charge the alien staring at me SCREAMING OVER AND OVER ""I'M GONNA RIP YOUR FUCKING EYES OUT!""  
When suddenly, in a selected area around me a BLUE LIGHT emanates. I can't move. I try with all the power I've got in me but I can't move a bit of my body. The aliens don't move either. They just watch me struggle. Then the blue light disappears and I collapse on the floor. Exhausted. It's then that I notice how surrounded I am. They are everywhere, but most aren't paying me any mind whatsoever. I see them flying around the ship. They are so lightweight that they move very fast and direction themselves with their minds. They remind me of fish.   


Now I can't remember exactly but I think I rushed the alien again. Most likely screaming the same obscenities. And they put the blue light on again only for a much shorter time. I'm completely spent at this point and can't even bring myself up. Then I hear it!  


It's a voice. But I'm not hearing it. It's inside my head. Like internal thoughts, but it's not my voice. It's one of the aliens. Talking into my head. It said:  
""Hey. I'm just doing my job. We/I are/am not gonna hurt you. We/I am/are just doing our/my job.""  
Then I feel EMOTIONS being pushed into my brain. This is not like how humans experience emotion brought on by a trigger. This was the feeling of guilt/remorse coming into my BRAIN and then consuming my BODY from an outside force and not only that, the emotion was AMPLIFIED to such a level that I actually apologized to the aliens for my behavior!!!!  


Writing this now it's hard to believe but it's true.   


Anyway the next thing I know I'm shambling down an ENORMOUS corridor. It is so enormous it reminds me of a church. Beside me are two or maybe three aliens. One to my left, right and maybe one behind me. The reason I was shambling is because the gravity was SO HEAVY. I could barely move. Back to the corridor. It was so tall that I don't think I could even see the top. And it was DARK. The only light to be seen was from.... The chairs.  


The chairs. The chairs. Bad memories about the chairs, man. All along the corridor to the left was a row of chairs. They were black steel and cast a green blueish hue from them. The worst part was the people in them. People. Black, white, every race. People dressed from different times, too. Some had fucking rags on, man. Like Pocahontas shit. Not all of them were filled though. Like there would be five in a group and then several empty and then one or two or three filled and then empty ones again.   


Okay. Let me catch my breath.   


Me and the aliens stopped at an empty chair. They put the thought in my head to get in the chair. I immediately start crying and begging them to not put me in one of them. I'm already sitting down in it. Their mental influence is overpowering. The alien tells me telepathically:  
""Calm down. Everything's going to be fine. It's okay. You're going to be okay. I promise everything will be fine. I'm just doing my job.""  


I take a deep breath and say ""okay.""  


The rest is blurs. I know they put something over my head that is connected to the chairs. It's like a glass mask. I don't know what the purpose of the chair is. I theorize that it scans the persons brain. But I have no clue.   


The next thing I know I'm in a room. It is BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT from all directions. Even the floor is white light but dimmed down just a bit. I am naked and in front of me are two women. One is a white woman with a slim build and bright red hair almost an orange and the other woman is a heavy set black woman with curly hair. They are both naked save for one thing covering their genitalia. It is like underwear but it isn't. It is not like anything we have on Earth. Let me explain what these women were doing. They were kissing, touching all over each other as I watched and the whole time I'm watching the fabric that is covering them doesn't move. It doesn't fold, stretch. NOTHING. It's as if it's part of their skin.   
I can sense the aliens in my brain again. They are urging me to join them and I do. But I don't do anything with them. I just sit with the women while they rub me, kiss me, etc. I can feel the aliens get upset that I am not having sex with them and because I'm not getting an erection. Some time passes and I still haven't done anything.  


BLACKOUT/TIME SKIP  


We are nearing the end of my experience. I find myself on ""the table"" you know the one everyone talks about. Yeah, that table. It reminds me of a surgical one. I can't say for sure what happened to me on that table. All I can say WITH ABSOLUTE IRON CERTAINTY is that there was one... ABOMINATION standing over me. He was tall as any human male. His head was like theirs but smaller and he had eyes, a nose and a mouth like ours and he was just staring at me. I've never felt such hatred before in my life. I told him ""If we ever meet again. I will fucking kill you."" He just kept smiling at me. He had a face like us and it burned into my mind. I will never forger it. And if I ever do meet him again. I will do my best to fucking kill it.  


Next thing I know I'm back in bed. But I can't move. Not one bit I still feel stuck and I can see HIS FUCKING FACE OUTLINED IN MY VISION. Like looking into a light and then looking away. When I could finally move I checked my testicles and all over my body and everything was okay. The only thoughts in my head was what I just experienced 100% happened and what we call ""Aliens"" are genetic engineers building something to do with humans! They don't want, need, eat, sleep, etc. They are like ants. One mind. One goal.  


I told a close friend and asked my neighbor if he had seen or heard anything weird last night. He just told me that some weird blue light was bothering him and confirmed that the power had went out.   


Anyway that's my experience. Not a very pleasant one. I shake my head every time I hear someone say ""I want to meet an alien"" and when I'm with someone like that in person I tell them ""No. You. Fucking. Don't.""  


You can believe this story or not. I know it fucking happened and at the end of the day it doesn't matter if anyone believes it or not. They are real, they are here and they have a plan.

The Occurrence….I don’t want to call it a dream because this felt too real and I was too aware of everything to diminish it to just a dream. But anyway The occurrence took place a few weeks ago. I was on this table and there was this being in a White lab coat kinda thing examining me. I couldn’t see its face but it didn’t feel human…It felt like it may have been human at one time but it has advanced to something that is just not human. I can’t really explain it. Its likes it didn’t have emotions, or empathy or any of those Human traits. It didn’t dawn on me that we can feel those things until I encountered this thing that didn’t have them. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was just observing me in a cold “I don’t care about you but this is my job” kinda way. Every 15 or so seconds I felt this intense pressure on my lower back…not painful but it felt like if someone took a smooth 2X4 piece of wood on its long end and just pressed it as hard as they could into your lower back. Progressively getting stronger and stronger 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is where the words that we currently possess become extremely useless but im going to try to explain. 

As the pressure got more intense I saw these images of…things that I remember but shouldn’t have?  It felt like when you see a toy or a show from your childhood, that overwhelming feeling of Nostalgia. But it was images of things that I’ve never seen. Or that I have seen but not in like this reality. The pressure would stop and I would try to catch my breath. The Thing that was watching me would take a note and then the Pressure would start again. More aggressively than the time before, this time the images became clearer and it was like my Brain was trying to get me to accept these images as real reality. Like my consciousness was trying to get pulled out of my body . It was exhausting because I was struggling to keep my consciousness in my body I felt like if I just let go and accepted it…that I would never “wake up”. Im sure that’s what Dying feels like. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Its like The thing was trying to see how much of this physical/mental pressure I could take but I guess it gave up.  It sat me in front of this screen which really wasn’t a screen but like a image being projected in my mind. It was the clearest picture I have ever seen in my life. It was a ""man"" laying down in a field on sunny day He was in this world that I remember but shouldn't . He was talking very softly it was super calming. I thought it was a movie but then the man looked over and started talking extremely aggressively ..He looked directly at me and yelled ""YOU..IM talking to YOU…why won’t you just come?"" 

I was awaken because my phone rang I was super disoriented. It was my coworker telling me that everyone we work with had just gotten fired. It was so confusing. I feel like I jumped into a different dimension or something…I just don’t know. Just wanted to share."
305,"Roach River Camps, Maine.",Abductions,6,"Edit: Obviously a throwaway account because of the stigma 

When I was young (maybe 6 or 8 in the 80's) my family stayed at Third Roach River Camp, which is a series of camps on a stream descending from Moosehead Lake in northern Maine. I can give an account of the whole day except for a few hours. 

I was sent out to put a white Styrofoam cup on top of the broken down gas pumps,(300 ft.from the camp) as a chore to placate a small child, to see how much rain we were about to get. 

On my way back to the camp there was something hanging in the air over a flooded marshy area adjacent to the camps. I felt drawn to it and couldn't stop myself from walking towards it. That's the last thing I remember until my mother's boyfriend found me bone dry on the camp porch after searching for me for hours in the rain. He was pissed. It took me a long time to understand why.

Estimating as an adult now, from a childhood memory, I would say it was at least 100 ft across. At that age the only thing I could equate it to was the Millennium Falcon, only perfectly smooth with nothing sticking out and no rivets or seams, perfectly round and semetrical. The stereotypical UFO.

What freaked me out, even at a young age was that there were no rivets or seams, it looked like it had been poured into shape, like liquid metal. It was just, perfect.

As an adult now, I'm tempted to go back to that place, but terrified of the thought at the same time."
306,Serious Question: Why do we not have a lot of video/photo evidence from abductions?,Abductions,33,"Hello Abductions subreddit,

I was a normie on UFO's until about 2 months ago, Richard Dolan primarily being the main person who convinced me the phenomenon is real. So I'm not a skeptic, just someone with a question I'd really like answered.

I've never been abducted but I know a lot of people tell stories of how they are abducted on a regular basis. This has led me to plan how I would try to document an abduction if it ever happened to me regularly. It seems that the ET's can paralyze, mind wipe, and even turn off electronics around the house they are operating in (Stan Romanek) -but still there has to be a way to get evidence. Have any abductees tried to hide a camera in a lead lined/or shielded box? or if you live in the country, put a camera a hundred yards from their house with a zoom lens on it and a motion sensor? Thermal cameras are expensive but they can work from a distance as well. If digital doesn't work, what about some kind of analog solution with high ISO film that triggers from a pressure plate?

I know the beings are telepathic so maybe they would read your mind and find out your trap? I'll admit I'm quite naive on this topic and am just genuinely curious for some insight on this matter. Thanks!"

I was asleep and like a normal case of sleep paralysis i opened my eyes but i couldnt move my body. I started bearing sounds like people walking all around my house and it kept getting louder and faster and closer to my window like big footprints and shuffling around. Then i saw a bright yellow light shine im my window and starts going in circles outside my window

after that i immediately passed out and got woken up by my drunk roommates coming home a few hours later haha

Has anyone else had an experience like this???"
310,It really bothers me that alien abductions aren’t researched more,Abductions,4,"If you’re reading this, you most likely already know that yes, aliens exist (greys, reptilians, mantis, etc) and are probably curious as to why they’re here in the first place.

While there is most likely more than one reason as to why they bother coming here, I get concerned knowing that people on this planet get abducted without really getting a choice to fight back or have the ability to NOT get abducted.

It’s so hard trying to research this phenomena thoroughly and I’m afraid we will never understand the alien species as much as they understand us, this is pretty suspect considering we have no way of knowing fact from fiction based on what “they” tell us. Are we REALLY here for spiritual growth? If so why are there stories of higher level beings harming humans? Why does one species say Jesus is from Venus while others say he’s from a different planet? So many contradictions to some stories?

What are your thoughts on the subject? Are we really being duped or am I over-reacting 🤔"
311,The Mantis Alien visited 2 different family members of mine at different times,Abductions,23,"I posted a few days ago about my brother thinking he’s been abducted his whole life. Here is his second story about an encounter with an “alien”. One day my brother showed up at my house with this story that had just happened to him the night before. 

He was sitting in his living room that night watching TV when suddenly he heard clicking sounds and a knock on his window. He got up to check and there was nothing. He want back to watch tv when he heard the clicking sound again and he ran to look outside, nothing. This continued twice more but the last one seemed to travel from his front window to the back window where his kitchen was at. He ran and turned all of his lights from the outside. At this point he was mad because he thought someone was trying to break in so he had a bat with him. 

His wife came out of the room and asked him what were all those clicking sounds she was hearing outside her window. She also told me she heard them. He told her not to worry and go back to bed and maybe it was kids messing around. He finally went to bed with a bat on him and left the lights on from the back porch. 

2:30 AM came and he woke up thinking it was time for him to get up for work. He needed to be up by 3:00AM. He sat up to look at the clock because it was next to his wife. He said to himself it was going to take him half an hour to go back to bed so he had already wasted his half an hour of sleep he had left. He laid back down, when he looked outside his bedroom door that was open he saw a tall man. He said it was about 7’ tall and had long arms passed its knees. The “man” had a long neck with a wider forehead and a very thin chin. He sat his head up and said “what the fuck is that?” And the man or alien noticed him and moved its head to take a closer look at my brother. 

He said his head moved side to side like a bug. He said he became very afraid and he covered up saying “it’s not there, it’s not there” he looked again and it was still standing there. The glare of the back porch light hit its eyes and they looked like the eyes of a fly but the color was red. Suddenly he felt very relaxed and fell asleep. He woke up at 3 not remembering what had happened. Later that day he heard his coworkers mention UFO’s and aliens when the memory came back! He then recalled that he had heard these same clicking sounds his whole life since he was a kid. He always thought someone was trying to come in through his window and was always afraid someone would break in. 

Ok, about a year later this same thing happened to my sister. For her this mantis alien grabbed her foot and she was able to move it out the way. It let go of her foot and looked closer at her the same way my brother described his. She also got sleepy and went back to bed. My sister has always lived with my husband, children and I, the scary part is that she said the only reason why she was even sleeping in that room was because I was afraid to sleep alone that night so she slept with me since my husband was working graveyard. I’m a grown woman I was probably 26 and I do remember being afraid to sleep alone that night for no reason.

Edit* my sisters story goes like this. she woke up in the middle of the night when she saw the same alien standing in front of her. The alien looked at her and moved its head from side to side and looked closer at her. She felt so afraid she started to try to move but readily couldn’t. She thought she was in sleep paralysis so she started to move her head side to side. Then she didn’t snap out of it and looked at it. The mantis alien reached out to grab her and she was shaking saying “no, no don’t touch me” it grabbed her leg and she tried to move it away. 

Once she moved it to the side she touched my foot and looked over to her right side and saw I was asleep next to her. She was fighting so badly to move because she was paralyzed but could almost snap out of it at the same time. Suddenly she was able to move her entire body. She could feel it was trying to tell her something or control her. When she snapped out of it she was able to bring her knees to her stomach and got into a a fetus position.She reached for her blanket and covered her face while shaking. She started saying “go away, go away” put her blanket down and it was still standing there, she did this about three times. Now keep in mind she wasn’t paralyzed anymore. She suddenly felt extremely sleepy and started hearing loud bangs but fell right to sleep."
312,Anyone has been abducted in a red room?,Abductions,12,"I want to ask any abductees if they have been abducted in a red room with hooded/cloaked tall figures, you can also write you experiences in the comments."
313,My brother thinks he’s been abducted his whole life,Abductions,21,"One of my brothers many weird stories has to do with him and 2 other people. When my brother was about 12, he, my oldest brother (13) and aunt (12) at the time were woken up to a strange light. They were having a sleep over at one of our older aunts house when suddenly a big bright light woke all 3 of them up. My aunts living room had a huge window that faced the street. My brother claims the light was so bright the entire room looked like daylight and it even made the room feel hot. They all looked at each other and didn’t say a word. Suddenly my brother recalls getting really sleepy and going back to sleep.

When the morning came they all asked each other if they remember what happened that night. They all had the same story, it was bright, hot and they all got extremely sleepy after being woken up by it, which all fell back asleep.

When our aunt woke up they all went and told her and her husband what had happened to them. He said the weirdest part was that she and her husband looked at each other and then said “who wants pizza?” and both left the room. He is now 37 and thinks my aunt and her husband might had experience that light before but didn’t want to speak of it."
314,Abducted? Or something else,Abductions,5,"I remember when I was young I used to sleep walk, but this one memory always come back to my mind. I think it was a dream but it felt so real, but I was walking down the hall to my parents room and I remember looking at the front door on my way there and it was lit up blue outside and it look like there were figures behind it and when I got to my parents room, I can’t remember what happened next. I used to always feel eerie when I was younger and I was always wide awake through the night and would hear noises, my dad told me that I used to come to their room every night and just stand at the foot of their bed, I kinda remember that too. He also told me that every time I would sleep, a dog would always come to my window and bark. I think I may have spiritual abilities, cause I always know when something is about to happen or I’ll feel a bad vibe from someone or a place. I looked it up and it seems I may have clairaudience but I don’t know, any comments?"
315,Unknown Memory,Abductions,7,"This is something that has bothered me for a very long time and I have tried asking all kinds of people about what it could be. This is the first time I'll have posted in an alien abduction area, as it never really occurred to me to do so.

&#x200B;

I have had this memory in the back of my mind ever since I was a very young child. It was something I didn't think about much as a kid, but as I grew up it unnerved me the more I thought about it.

&#x200B;

The memory is of an examination table. I was young, a child, probably only 3 or 4 in this memory, but it's so fuzzy unlike all my other memories from that age. I am in a room surrounded by medical cabinets, two strangers (Wearing white, but I was too scared to look at thier faces) and one persona who was supposedly a parent. But something felt off and it didn't feel like one of my parents at all. 

&#x200B;

There was a large, circular light made up of smaller lights above me much like the ones used in surgery and they moved it down as I was instructed to lay flat on the exam table. I remember it felt soft and warm, not like exam tables usually felt. That's when things got strange and what actually troubles me. They reached for a metal tool which had a similar shape to a small hand held power drill, but on the end was a long head that had several rows of small bristles running down the length of it. They then told me to hold still, which made me very nervous and I started crying. They told me to stop crying and it'd be over quickly and moved it between my legs where it felt as if it was inserted into my urethra. It was painful and burned, but thankfully it only lasted around 5 seconds before it was removed.

&#x200B;

After removal, I was obviously crying and scared, but I could hear them talking to my 'parent' beside me saying that 'she will probably need to have this redone when she is older'. To which my 'parent' agreed and helped me off the table.

&#x200B;

I asked my mother if I ever had any procedures as a child and she denied any knowledge of it at all. I also had my medical records checked and it was no where to be seen. There was nothing at all like it. I also researched what the heck it could have been if it was a genuine medical procedure, but I've been unable to find anything that fits it exactly. 

&#x200B;

It bothers me, because it doesn't make any sense and it was definitely not a dream. After that age I used to get severe pain when peeing until I reached around 10 years old. Does anyone have any idea what it could have been? I've posted in medical places online about this, on paranormal sites, all sorts and so far no one can give me any answers."

317,something crawlled into my room,Abductions,6,"so i been having these nightmares for about a few years, in which alien pulse beams or vibrations into my ear that goes into my brain. but when i wake up my door opens up. im pretty sure im dreaming but, the story gets weirder its like something crawlled into my room, through my windows its not a second story, but, it is pretty high, and i cant imagine anything trying to jump up into it, but here goes, i wake up with a feeling the door opens up, and then closes. like something came in my room and fled as soon as i wake up, its hard to explain. like a game they play, ive seen them, they have monsters like with ground sharp teeth, and theyre the grey's. they dont talk to me. or anything, i do have urges to puke in the mornings. but i cant explain that either."
318,alien mindcontrol/our perception,Abductions,2,"ive seen signs and faces sometimes, theyre bad and gets worse, like theyre invisible, cant believe  that telepathy alone can move or tear objects apart to shape these signs or faces, im sure they might be closer to their victims than we think, like a blind spot. in our perceptions in our minds, we do see everything in the back of our heads, and therefore we interpretate, everything, in the strangest ways we might even believe is our self, but if we dont see the same what do we see, and if we dont taste the same thing what do we taste, so many un answered questions. about our blind spots.

320,Strange dreams about alien encounters. Real or just dreams?,Abductions,9,"So, I don't usually dream very frequently and when I do, I don't remember any of it after I wake up. However, this past week I've had two strange dream experiences that I actually remember.

First dream was only about 3-5 seconds, which I feel like is really short for a dream. I'm laying in my bed and a tall, thin alien is looking down at me. I think it was a grey alien that people tend to describe, but I'm not sure. It then moves one arm towards me and pokes me in the shoulder/upper chest. Not sure if it was a finger or instrument or what. I immediately wake up and sit straight up in bed suddenly, feeling very startled. I remember exactly what just happened like it was a memory of an actual event. Usually my memories of dreams fade and disappear quickly, but I still had this very vivid memory.

Second dream was a few days after and is slightly longer, maybe 10 seconds. I'm laying in a bed, but it's not my bed and I see that there are many, many smaller grey aliens standing all around me. Maybe 5-7 of them. I sit up and say something like ""Oh, hey there guys."" Like I'm familiar with them or something, like I recognize them and this is just another encounter. Which is strange as I think about it now, because this is the first dream I can recall seeing these things. I immediately turn to the alien closest to me and grab it by the neck hard and squeeze as hard as I can. I say to them ""If you touch me, I will kill you."" I remember being incredibly angry and threatening towards them, which feels out of character to me. I wake up at that moment.

What was weird about the second one was that it felt more real and vivid than the first. I remember having a 5 seconds of staring at the things and thinking ""Damn, these things are really real and standing right here. And there's more than one."" I feel like they had a smug air about them, almost like they were smiling or something.

I don't know if this counts as an abduction or not. I don't recall a ship or operations or anything like that. I just have these weird memories that don't feel like dream memories because, well, I don't remember my dreams.

Is this just me having a weird dream episode or what? Does anyone have any similar experiences?"
321,My very very strange experiences,Abductions,36,"So one afternoon I was in the restroom and I had the doors locked. (Prevous experinces have made me ocd about locking doors) I was looking at my hand and observing my aura. A new layer was starting to become visible and as it started forming I heard weird clicking noises outside the bathroom door. At first I laughed and said to myaelf that I was crazy but then the thing started wiggling the doorknob and I froze in terror. I realized this was very very real and I had no idea what it was or if I was about to die. It keot fucking with the door and making more clicking noises. I could hear my cat growling in the living room. It had circled around and banged loud af on my window. I then got images in my head of my fiance needing the keys and I almost opened the door. But then I realized he had the keys and was at a greinds house. I realized the thing was trying to trick me to comw out of the bathroom so I stayed firm. I heard more clicking and then it banged on my kitchen counter. After that it stayed silent and I stayed frozen in plave until my fiance came home. For hours afterwards my heart was racing and I was TERRIFIED. I was literally shaking and I worried my fiance. What was scarier is when he came home I saw nothing but I still felt the presence of it in my apartment watching me.   I'm confused as to why it stopped me from looking at my aura and ive read that they can just walk through walls. How come it was trying to open the door and couldnt get in? It seemed like it had to trick me to come out. Do you guus have any opinouns on this or info that may help?  Ive seen beige looking greys like the ones from the communion but theyve never made clicking noises before. They just stare at me when I see them. This was a traumatizing experience and I put cameras up in every room after that.  

 During a kundulini awakening I felt a presence enter the room from my window and move towards me. This is where it gets weird. I felt it go into my body and it was like the entire left side of my body was a seperate consciousness if that makes sense. 

I had a dream recently where a grey being came into my home and sat next to me while I was watching tv. He told me he was with me for an eternity and that he saw light everywhere. Idk what to think about this dream.  

Another time I was walking home and as I cane up the driveway I saw a grey like the communion ones with no clothing or genitalia staring at me from the bushes. It was hunched iver by my window. I was so scared I pretended like I didnt see it and sat in the living room till my fiance got home. Who knows what would have happened if I had gone to my room right next to that thing.  

Another time I was in my backyard smoking when I saw it by the fence and it was like 8-10 feet tall and was shifting its weight on its feet to get my attention by snapping the twigs on the ground. I of course went inside to get a fkashlight came back and it wasnt there. It made me look crazy in front of my friends bevause I was too frightened to point it out to them and just went straight inside.  

Another experience was when I was maybe 8 or 9. I dreamt I heard my sisters screaming in the hallway so I ran out and down the hall by their bedroom was a short hooded figure. I ran up to it and pulled it into the bathroom. I switched on the light to see what it was and as I was turning my head to see it I felt a pain in my left side and woke up. When I opened my eyes there was a grey literally inches from my face, it was too dark to make feature but I knew it wasnt human. I looked at it fir a couple seconds before it literally vanished into thin air. Confused I rolled over and went back to sleep.  

A recent dream I had was of myself with a group of maybe 10 to 15 individuals who were standing in a line waiting on this platform on an ocean. I saw a moon zip through the sky and dive into the ocean. A large portal then opened up in the water and I saw a very tall blue being with an oval shaped head rise up from the water and make its way to the platform. It came up to me and read my mind and I could see the images in my mind as it did. It showed me I needed to stop drinking and smoking if I wanted to know who I was. I accepted this and it came back to me and reavaluated my mind. It then told me to make my way to a doorway which was alot like the portal doors from Dr. Strange. A human male doctor greeted me and took me to his office. He told me my fiance would have a memory wipe and forget I existed. I was obviously upset at this and next thing I knew I was teleported in the air suspended over the portal in the ocean. I saw a massive city made of metal material with layers and layers of walkways. It looked alot like ZION from the matrix from air view. I was then dropped into it and as I descended yellow strands suspended in the air appeared and moved through me as I fell. Before I reached the city I woke up. 

I also strongly get the feeling I'm always being monitored. Not only from a third person view but from my own eyes if that makes sense. I always feel weird when I look in the mirror like someone else is seeing what I see. I have implants so maybe its a visual form of monitoring I hinstely don't know. All I know is in not crazy and this is very very real. I wish I was crazy :,(

lastly as far as my ""alien"" experinces i woke up in the middle if the night a while ago when i had a random memory flash. i was lying down and i saw this grey looking being looking down at me and it was smiling. it looked very different from the other ones  ive seen. it looked more human. it had black eyes but they were really bulgy and human shaped. its face was grey and round not like the greys who have bug shaped heads. i guess maybe a hybrid of human and grey idk but it weirded me out."

324,Weird dream,Abductions,5,"So I was just wondering about a rather vivid dream I had when I was a kid. I remember walking through a metal hall with my head pointed downward. There was some sort of presence behind me, but I was unable to turn around to see it. It was almost like I was more or less a weary observer in my own body. My mind itself was essentially shut down (no thoughts or emotions; pretty much just a pure consciousness witnessing my senses) and my body moved almost as if it was an automatic command. No actual will of my own was going into my actions. I was lead to a table where a girl around my age was laying. I then got over her and, well, started having sex. Not exactly enjoyable as we were both dead eyed and not truly ""present"" or acting upon our own will. Now I chucked this up to a bizarre wet dream, but what was strange was the sensation of the sexual encounter felt very real, which is odd because I was only 13 and had never had sex in my life. In fact after losing my virginity I confirmed that it felt exactly the same. I still believe it was probably just a really vivid dream, but I was curious what other people on here thought."

327,Potential ongoing abductions - or just weird dreams?,Abductions,15,"I want to start by getting to the point, because the long posts are intimidating to me, and I'm about to post one. So, for background before what's currently happening, I'll add that after.

So recently I was on vacation at the beach. I had a great time, but on the last night, I had a wild dream that seemed to last about 10 real world days, even though when I woke up it was just the next day in the real world. What I remember is that there were three moons. It seemed like there was the normal moon, another smaller moon emerging from behind it, and a very massive moon that I was sure was going to hit the Earth. I was completely isolated the whole time though from any other people, and made it all the way home. I was extremely afraid the whole time. I thought I was going to die. Once I made it back to my house, I literally locked myself in my room with my cat, and huddled in the corner with it. The room was pitch black at this point, all the blinds were closed, and I was extremely afraid to look outside because of the moons. Even though it seemed like 10 real life days, it was dark the whole time. The first thing I did when I woke up, was tell everyone in the room about the dream, because it was very lucid and seemed very real. It really felt like I had just woke up at the beach after not being at the beach for 10 days, even though I had been for several days.

Everything was back to normal after that. A few nights later, I had the same dream. Three moons. This time I wasn't afraid. I was back at the beach though. For whatever reason when I woke up, I started thinking that the big moon wasn't actually a moon, and it might have actually been some sort of vessel (perhaps I'm reaching).

The next night, I had a very similar dream, back at the beach, but never looked at the sky. Very lucid, at the same beach, but not in the same place. I don't remember much more than that about it. That was a few nights ago. Since then, I've been getting much less sleep, but I'm not tired. It's been progressive over the past few days, until this point. I was very tired when I went to sleep last night, which was around 11 pm local time. I woke up at 3 am local time, but feeling completely rested. I also had a very vivid dream, but this time not at the beach. This time the dream took place here. I was in a parking lot, and had my car keys, and kept pressing the unlock button to find my car, but it wasn't there. There were other cars in the lot, just not mine.

If I had any questions, it would be if this could be an abduction situation, or just random vivid dreams being a result of something unrelated, even though I can't think of what would trigger it. It was a great vacation. I had a great time.

\----------------------------------------------

Back story time:

I've seen various UFOs. The first from my adult life that I remember was what appeared to clearly be a fireball in the sky. I was driving, it was over my city, and I'm 100% sure it existed. It changed direction in 90 degree angles, and seemed to purposely change it's speed. I saw it for at least 30 seconds, was able to make it home maintaining eye contact, ran inside to get someone to also look, but it was gone when I came outside.

The second from my adult life would be a massive flash in the sky. I'd describe it as either being a picture snapped from space, or a galaxy literally exploding. It was massive, and witnessed by multiple people who were outside with me. We were actually staring at the sky, and there's no dispute that it happened, but no idea what it was.

I had another experience with a different friend, where I was driving and we saw what looked like the moon shining through the clouds, but it was so massive it didn't seem like it could be the moon. We talked about that, stared at it, and he was more certain it was a UFO than me, until we actually saw the moon in a different direction, much smaller, in the same car ride which was from one side of town to the other. He still tells the story every chance he gets. - Now that I think about it, that could have been the same thing from the dreams.

I had another experience seeing a UFO during the day. I wasn't 100% sure it was a UFO, but I was almost certain it couldn't be a plane. I was actually with my sister and her boyfriend at the time, standing and having a conversation out side. I literally pointed at it and told them I thought it was a UFO, and they literally didn't even turn around and look at it. I'll never forget that.

\----------------------------------------------

I had vivid reoccurring dreams as a very young child too. I can remember being a toddler. I have several core memories from being three and four years old, and I know I'm not mistaken, because I was adopted when I was four. For reference, I'm 27 now. One of the dreams I told adults about, that my adoptive parents remember as well, is a dark figure walking into the room and beating me. You may want to assume this was a result of something happening in real life, but it's not. I came from a very bad home, but I wasn't abused. I just didn't eat a lot, and we didn't have nice things.

In that dream, which didn't feel at all like a dream at the time, I was sharing a bed with my mom. I had my own room, but I hated being in there alone. It was a daily thing for my mom to tell me that my grandparents were right beside me on each side, even though they weren't there, just to try to comfort me. They were still alive and I saw them all the time, this was just something she would say to make me more comfortable. On this particular night, that didn't work, because I remember I was sharing a bed with her.

She was asleep, and it felt like I was awake and just sitting there. A dark figure approached from my room (the figure specifically was so dark it seemed like it didn't have a face, even though it was humanoid), but I wasn't afraid because there was a child gate on the door, and I assumed he couldn't cross it. He did cross it though, picked me up by my legs, carried me out of the room, and physically beat me. I woke up in the bed, told my mom, told my grandparents, and eventually told my adoptive parents about it at some point. I told them it was real, and that it wasn't a dream.

I remember after that, sometime later, waking up in the middle of the night, and my bed was surrounded by dark figures just like it. There were maybe eight of them, if I had to guess based on the memory, which I still have. I deeply feared these figures as a toddler.

I also had a reoccurring dream on a regular basis that always played out the same way. I was at a gas station, there were people there, but they always did the same things. It seemed like a normal situation, but one person (who was always the same person) would walk up to one of the glass windows, and smash their head into it, through the glass, killing themselves instantly. I don't know if this dream actually ties into this in any way, but I had that dream more than twice, and it was always exactly the same.

\----------------------------------------------

I had two other notable extremely vivid dreams growing up. One where I was in a very big city, that had a lot of neon-style lighting, as far as I could see in any direction, that seemed to last for multiple days. I remember specifically thinking when I woke up, that it seemed like I was on a different planet or something.

The other, I was in a more green area. Something like a field. It didn't feel like a dream at all, and there was one other person there. I remember asking the person what was going on, and they told me that I was just having a dream. This is the only time in a vivid dream where I gained full control of the situation. After he told me it was a dream, I felt aware that it was actually a dream, and just kind of walked around for a while. There wasn't anything really to do in the field, but I had full control over what I did, as opposed to any other dream I've ever had. I remember thinking it might not have been just a dream when I woke up, but didn't think much more than that at the time.

\----------------------------------------------

Anyone that took the time to read it all, what do you think? This is all 100% true. I couldn't make this up if I tried. I'm not that creative. I have my doubts it's related at all to aliens or something, but the more I think about it, the more I feel like it could be something like that. I feel like there's more to include, but I'm hyper-focused on the events I've already listed here."
328,did i get abducted by Mantis Aliens?,Abductions,7,"I haven’t thought about this memory in a while but watching this video made it all come rushing back…
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTtLfDtZl9Y
ok i am losing my mind I have seen the alien bugs with blue gray jumpsuits described in the video where the man and wife are driving and they thought it was an ambulance. my whole life I have had very weird experiences and this is actually the most recent one. I always thought they were very weird dreams but having someone else see exactly what I have just cant be a coincidence???? All I remember is being in the middle of nowhere and being very confused, it was a dirt road and I think there was forest around me and it was the middle of the night. the strange thing is, I live in the beach in California. there is no forest anywhere near me. I don't know how the hell I got there but I was just there when I heard these very weird noises, they were almost like clicking noises but I just knew it was a language and I knew it was 2 voices arguing. Then I saw them there were 2 of them and they were standing next to a thing I knew was a broken automobile or whatever vehicle aliens use. i cant remember how it looked like at all but their outfits stand out so much! i remember distinctly the bluish grayish thick leatherlike almost destressed with a bit of shine. and there were all these little rivets and what i can only describe as zippers and pockets all over these jumpsuits (but again i knew they weren't buttons and zippers, they were also otherworldy but i have no terms for it) also iremember they had very strong, tall human bodies like 6'3"" gorgeous bodies (you could see the muscles through the thick material) but they had hideous insect faces and greenish brownish redish bug skin (but not a praying mantis green! more like an alien but i swear that part of my memory keeps switching between greenish and reddish so i don't know why my mind is fucking with me like that) the skin was a base brown with a hint of red and green to it and they eyes were much bigger than a praying mantis. but they did have similar shaped heads. and looking through pictures they do seem to resemble them the most. the creepiest thing is when i type in the description on google right now (i didn't say anything about praying mantis) I just described the coloring and that is what came up. So anyways i was a bit confused when i came to in this road but strangely i wasn't scared but the moment i saw them i can only describe pure terror. like i was sure i was going to die terror. I have seen some horrible things in my life but this is the first time i just gave up. I literally just fell down on the dusty ground and tried to melt into it. I so totally remember feeling the dirt on the side of my cheek and being too fucking scared to even look up. But i know they saw me and i know they walked over to where i was laying and one bent down over me and that is the last i remember. Other than waking up with a scream and recounting the events over and over again. ohh and i remember being exhausted when i woke up, like i didn't sleep at all.... (omg i just looked up what an African mantis looks like because of #arachnonixon post and holy shit if they had big black eyes then that's what i saw! and in the pictures some have green skin and some have red skin so i don't know?!?!)

(ahh i just got up the nerve to look up mantis alien on google and i swear if you put a dirt road in front of this picture this it what i saw!!! the fact they not only drew exactly what i saw but in the location i saw it is crazy!!!! https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjtwqrZjdThAhUJHXwKHYYDDAEQjxx6BAgBEAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fitgetsweird.libsyn.com%2Fepisode-14-the-best-party-aliens&psig=AOvVaw2GkgkfwMM5ZhF8Eokx0XXu&ust=1555486427698069"

332,"A true story told seldom in person, never online.",Abductions,9,"This is a real experience that occurred in San Sebastián, Puerto Rico in the summer of 01.  I've told it to my best friend when it first happened and my girlfriend but no one one else outside of the people involved and never online.

My mother ( almost ever year) took me to her hometown in Puerto Rico for about a month in summer of 01 to stay at my Titi Mari's house with her husband, daughter and son who we'll call Jose, Yary and Chris respectively.  Chris is like a brother to me and just 8 months younger while Yary is about 4 years older than us, we were teenagers at the time.  We were all telling ghost stories one night when Yary tells my mother and I that she's been waking up at 3am by feeling touched and/or hearing things and then just falling back to sleep.  I think that's pretty wild but holds no merit so no sweat...

My mom and Yary shared a bed while I'd carried around a small twin sized air mattress to sleep on in different rooms of the house but mainly stayed in Chris' room.  He and I, like normal, were awake joking around instead of sleepingn at about 11pm when we hear my mom scream in the distance so Chris and I dart to Yary's room to see what's going on.  We go in the room and my mom is freaking out, saying something pulled the covers off of her... I think to myself ""Really?  You're feeding into Yary's bullshit?"". Chris and I then return to his room.  I notice Yary's bedroom feels kind of detached, you had to go through a walk-in closet to get to it.  While the master bedroom, general bathroom and Chris' bedroom all line up one next to another in the main hallway of this concrete one story home, hers is across the hallway and the through walk-in closet.  Everyone goes back to bed.

Tio Jose has a brother with a beach house but not enough room for all of us so Jose and Mari decide to take Chris there for the week while Yary, my mom and I would go and meet them at the beach on Saturday.  I move my air mattress to the floor in Yary's room and everything is normal for a few nights but then Wednesday night I'm awoken by my mother kicking me.  As I'm getting up to ask her what her problem is, she tells me something woke them up by scratching on the window.  If you're  unfamiliar with old school Miami windows, they're tin horizontal shutters that open and close with a spinning handle and once they close little to no light comes in.  I ask my mom if she's sure and i start opening the window to look outside.  I see a thunderstorm in the distance and figured it had something to do with it.  My mom says that's not possible, storms out the room, through the walk-in closet and says in Spanish while looking up at one of the main hallways skylights ""See?! What is this?!"".  I look up and see different colored lights flashing through the distorted piece of glass.  I check the bathroom skylight, same thing.  I say ""it must be the lightning storm!"". My mom says ""No!  That storm was off in the distance.  I'm going to see what's going on it there"". As she's grabbing the key to unlock the gate at the entrance of the hallway (Jose was a welder), I'm standing in the bathroom and I remember... Jose installed the washing machine on the roof of the house and made a small tin structure to cover it, all of which sat directly on top of the skylight...  I ran to my mom begging and pleading her not to go outside or anywhere the roof.  She wass resistant at first but I guess she heard the fear in my voice and obliged.  We were able to calm down and go back to sleep in our beds.

Thursday was hot all day and was about to be hot at night so we decided to sleep in Jose and Mari's room since it was the only room with an ac unit and they were at the beach.  I lay my mattress between the queen size bed my mom and Yary are about to share and a row of mirrors which served as the doors to the bedroom closet.  The room had a lot of windows but they were all closed when it came time to sleep so it'd be pitch black in the room expect for a small amount of light from a streetlight that would barely shine in through a crooked window shutter.  We lay down and we all fall asleep... I'm awoken but by what?  The chickens out behind the house are going pretty crazy, it must've be that... But why isn't Buddy, their aggressive little dog that slept next to the chicken coop, barking? 
""Weird... What time is it?""
The digital clock next to Yary says it's 3:00.  That same green light let's me see Yary turn around in bed to face away from me.  I lay my head back down as my eyes adjust to the dark and look to the feet of my mattress to barely make out a tall, thin figure standing between me and the door.  The streetlight leaks in, reflects in the mirror and reveals a flash of grey.  My heart starts pumping but I become sleepy and pass out.

I awaken to sunlight coming through the open windows, I get up out of bed and try to write off the previous night as a dream.  I go to the bathroom and start brushing my teeth when I hear Yary telling my momb in the distance that she woke up again last night at 3am and felt something in the room so she rolled over to face the wall... I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I run into the kitchen where they were eating bread and butter and I asked ""you saw it too?!  Did you hear the chickens going berserk?*. She nonchalantly says ""yeah that's what I've been tryna tell you"".  The rest of the trip went uneventful and we took our regularly scheduled flight back to PHL.  

On a side note:. I'm not sure if it's unrelated but almost immediately after getting back home i started suffering from really bad sleep paralysis.  I mean having an episode in the middle of the night, turning on the tv on for comfort and go right back to sleep to another episode.  It also includes weirder events like when I ""woke up"" in my bed, got up but stumbled when my legs didn't work, busting my lip on the floor during the fall, laying on the floor calling for my mom for help until I would feel like I was floating from the floor back to my bed and waking up in the morning with a swollen lip.  This continued until I had a live-in girlfriend and now I may have a small episode once in a year.

None of this infirmation has been fabricated except for the names of the people.  All of this is true and a first hand recollection of 30yo insomniac"
333,Sammy Hagar and Alien Abduction,Abductions,0,0
334,Possible abduction,Abductions,28,"This happened late last year (mid September 2018) and I've been having increasingly weird things happen to me since.
I remember falling asleep around noon on a Tuesday (or so I thought). I suddenly startled awake and it was pitch black outside and my houses lights were off (which was weird, considering I always leave the hall light on just for a little light at night). I began looking for my phone to see what time it was, but I couldn't find it (also weird; I always have it charging on my nightstand when I sleep). I stood up to go turn a light on and I felt extremely dizzy, and nearly fell over. A light brighter than I'd ever seen started to shine through my window (especially unusual since my bedroom is a second floor room). I peeked out my window and then the light stopped and I was frozen in place, I tried to move my body, but only my eyes would move. I heard footsteps behind me and an intense fear gripped me. I managed to close my eyes and when I opened them next, I felt like I was lying on cold metal, while a bright light shone in my eyes. I remember feeling the same terror as when I was frozen. I felt extremely sluggish like I was moving through syrup, and I looked to my left. There was a grey standing right next to me looking intently into my eyes. As I looked into its eyes, I grew calmer and my vision faded again. When I woke up, I was back in my bed, and it was still day outside. I reached for my phone and it was right where I left it. The time was around 6 am the next day.
Now, onto the strange happenings.
A few weeks after, I had an ear wax buildup in my left ear, after cleaning it out it was fine. However, I've gone through several pairs of earbuds since, as the left but always stopped working (my over ear headphones haven't stopped working though). Since then, I've noticed sounds in my left ear sound clearer than my right. Days after that, I was sitting at my desk looking through some old files when my thoughts started racing. I was suddenly overcome with the need to write, so I opened a word document and started typing the next 15 minutes were a blur, my fingers moving fast and my mind moving faster. I don't remember much, but I still have the document(I'll link it at the end). This happened a few times over the next few months and I only saved a few (the most cohesive). One time, instead of writing I drew a symbol that I have yet to identify. (Will link at the end) Since then, I've had multiple blackouts (basically memory loss) happen at random times, even while I was doing focus intensive things like playing video games.
I'm not sure if these events are connected, or if I'm just completely losing it, but over the past few weeks, I've been feeling a sense of impending doom that gets to be overwhelming at times. I just felt like I needed to share my story and get thoughts and opinions from like minded people.

336,Does anyone feel like they are being watched/monitored?,Abductions,7,"I have an incredibly long story about how I suddenly feel like something is watching me, possibly inside me. I won’t type it out since most people probably won’t see this topic (if I see a comment asking about my experience them I’ll be more than happy to type it out later tonight (currently 9:37 AM where I’m at so maybe 9 hours later?)

Anyway, here’s a TL;DR just in case:

After reading a book titled Thiaoouba Prophecy (I’d actually advise against reading it because a lot of odd things started happening such as me dreaming a bright light “swallowed” me and I was in a field that had sparkles) just floating in the air and I had the ability to float; not just float up but I definitely remember making swimming motions to move around floating in the air, there was no walking)

I also read a book about some dual soul program. I bought the kindle version, would not mind sharing for free) The book is titled “Dual Soul Connection by a woman named Suzy Hansen. The book describes her life as an individual who shares her consciousness with an extraterrestrial)

Here’s where things get weird. I was studying to be a middle school math teacher. I studied for hours and on test day the questions looked nothing like the practice test offered by MTEL (Massachusetts teacher license site)

The actual math test resembled NOTHING like the practice test. However, the practice test book from a third party I bought for extra studying resembled the real test a little too well.

Anyway, during test day I had a feeling that I failed because I focused much of my turn on the mtel practice exam. With 4 minutes left I remember having 17 unanswered questions, a half assed response on one of the open response questions, and I did not even finish the 2nd open response question.

When I left the testing center I had the feeling that I failed because of the open response and me guessing 17 questions. Turns out on my score report I had a thorough understanding on open response (highest grade) and did very well on multiple choice. I’d like to point out that I had thoughts about passing nights before my score report came out.

I have so much more to tell, but I know for a fact something is “inside me” and I just wanted to get my story out because it is driving me crazy, literally (diagnosed as bipolar... I’m pretty sure someone’s pulling strings so I seem unauthentic.

Thank you for reading at least this far. Hopefully people who feel the same way can relate. I’m clearly some pawn in this abduction/alien project going on

Again, I will answer any (if any questions) you have"
337,"I want to share my experience to see what you guys think, my therapist says it is psychosis *sigh*",Abductions,40,"This post is probably going to be a little bit out of sorts, I am going to try to organize it the best way that I can. Alot of the paragraphs may not be arranged properly, and I'm just going to write down some thoughts as well, to see what you guys think. I apologize in advance for any grammar errors or other mistakes: 



Ever since I was a kid, maybe as early as 7 or 8, I can recall a very, very bright light shining in my eyes, so bright that it makes your eyes feel very tired and weak. In 5th and 6th grade, I drew green aliens everywhere and were obsessed with them, although looking back I never really understood where they came from. It's something I think about often, as it is something I remember but could never grasp where the memory came from. I was frightened of the movie E.T. and used to scream and cry. Anyway, some weird things have happened to me over the years, at night.     

Instance one:
One of two people out of six see and watch a glowing orb fly around the sky, late at night 2am ish. Very soon after seeing that I suddenly lost control of my car at 30mph around a bend I travel daily. It flipped and I was ejected out, but I still can not understand whatever even caused me to lose control, as it seemed like I hit an icy patch on the road at the end of August in warm weather. We seemed to be upside down for a moment and the car suddenly flipped back on to it's trees, how I do not know. I cannot, for the life of me figure out how the accident happened. My son was 7 and was with me and he doesn't understand it until this day, either. My father had a similar experience in upstate NY, he woke up with his truck in a small ditch and doesn't remember what happened or how he got there and he wasn't hurt and didn't appear to have ever hit his head. He was not drinking or using drugs. He says he lost about two hours he cannot account for and the last thing he remembers is being almost home. This is an area know as Pine-Bush, NY, known for activity. He was working an engineering job for the government. He quit, abruptly and drove home the following day and never went back. He talked to me about it, because he knows I believe in these things, and I believe him as something similar happened to me. Neither of us have any idea how our accidents happened, these are accidents that did not involve any other vehicles. 

Instance one: Loud, vibrating, buzzing, propellor outside my window. My motion lights go completely dark and I hear someone walk past my window. The vibrating noise is so loud, that I could feel it vibrating my bones. I check the fan, it wasn't the fan. I was too scared to move or look out the window. Fear overcame me like no other. I felt almost certain I was not alone. I get this thought in my mind out of nowhere, ""close your eyes, try to concentrate on blocking this sound out and it will go away."" I try this and it works. I was able to concentrate like I've never concentrated before and I was able to block it out. I stop concentrating, I can hear the sound and feel it in my bones. My daughter was in my bed, I look over at her she's sound asleep. The next morning, my mom comes over for coffee. I start telling her about last night. My daughter overheard us from another room and said ""I heard that too, and I felt that too, it was so weird!"" I was petrified because she looked like she was in a very deep sleep and she usually is a light sleeper! We shrug it off. Eventually forget about it. 

Occurrence 2: I am alone in my room. I began to hear the sound very late at night. It wakes me, I look at my bedroom window and it looks brighter than daylight outside. I somehow knew it was still night time. I knew something wasn't right. The last thing I remember is ""They are here again, they are here, they are here."" Terrible fear and dread. I had two very weird dreams that I woke up and looked at the window and it was daylight, then actually did wake up and look at the window and it was daylight. My neck hurts, I have a terrible headache. I feel like I'm going to puke. I feel violated, not like myself. I go upstairs, make my coffee, and I go to rub my own neck, and felt a large, painful bump behind my ear. I freak out, thinking it is cancer. It stays swollen for a few weeks, and subsides, but the bump is there, sometimes gets bigger, but feels like something is inside there, my mother even agreed it is STRANGE. Could be a lymph node, but I have had a lot of swollen lymph nodes and none of them ever hurt like this. It was a feeling like no other. 

Occurrence 3: I fall asleep on my chair in my living room. I'm home all alone. I remember being between a dream and wake state and watching a bunch of figures with rounded black heads walk around my dining room. They sound like they are having a party. I act like this is normal and the last thing I remember is feeling like something is choking me from the inside of my throat. I wake up on the chair coughing and choking and it feels like cat scratches on the inside of my throat. I feel violated, headache, nauseous, like I am going to throw up. 

Occurrence 4: The most recent. I wake up, and I look at the bedroom window, it is bright, white light. I know it is still night time. I remember my whole body vibrating, shaking, going numb like I am being electrocuted. I try breaking out of it, I'm fighting it. I don't remember anything after that, but I wake up the next morning remembering what happened. I decide to tell my therapist all of the above. They think I am nuts and in psychosis. I am not surprised. 

Occurrences involving my 9y/o daughter: My daughter is in my bed again, and I am going to add that she is 9 and frightened to sleep in her room alone as she's woken up to watch felt like someone trying to grab her and take her, reported seeing what looked like a man wearing a bag on his head in her room. She was hysterical, and her arm was red. She is still scared of her bedroom. The following night I was fighting something in my sleep and could feel them grabbing my arm. I wake up to my daughter screaming my name and telling me to calm down. The next day I wake with a giant bruise on my arm. There are many occurrences that involve me and my daughter. She wakes up with terrible nose bleeds at night sometimes. Other times we both wake up at the same time and look at eachother. She sometimes wakes up and vomits. She complains of headaches, nausea, and feeling anxious  before bed alot. The doctor tells me to try melatonin or Benadryl with Tylenol, and they tell me the vomit is post nasal drip. I have always felt connected to my daughter, in a weird way that I can't describe. She often warns me of danger, and bad feelings. Tells me to slow down when driving and we end up missing a deer on the road, and have missed a few accidents because of that by a few seconds. She has been drawing UFO's with aliens inside, with a rainbow light coming from it. I'm working on figuring out where the idea came from, because it freaks me out as the picture is laying on the coffee table in view right now. If anyone wants to see the drawing I can link it, it pretty vague, but what I think is weird is how I started drawing aliens at her age. 

Some random things and background: 

I was always sick as a child, with Epstein-Barr virus, and it seemed to destroy my entire immune system as I ended up with an autoimmune hypothyroid condition. My mother began looking for specialist in the area as my GP noticed I had a large goiter in my neck. I also suffered from very, very frequent throat infections, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, laryngitis, sinus infections, allergies, migraines, and very serious ear problems. So, I lucked out with this specialist as he is not only an ear, nose and throat specialist, he is also a thyroid and parathyroid specialist. So this guy became my go-to doctor. I was his lab rat. I am 31 years old now, but I saw this doctor from about age 9-17, then visited him again at 26 when I was really ill, again. The last visit I had with this doctor, he did double tube placements in my ears, and they were very, very painful. I had them done before and they did not hurt in that way. So a month or two later, I find out I am pregnant with my son. One day, when I was about 5 or 6 months along I get into the shower and suddenly start hearing a loud, PAINFUL, intense buzzing sound. I was frightened. It did not stop right away, but it slowly got better, and I forgot about it. Years later I lost my hearing 90% in that ear and he says he could have ""saved"" my hearing had I called and told him. Ever since that incident, I hear what sounds like radio frequency, static, buzzing, clicking, chiming, and starting the left ear it will ring into the other ear. For a long time, I wondered if I had some kind of bug or implant placed in my ear, I've read stories about this type of thing happening to people, and they slip them into your ears during procedures like tube placements and free hear aid trials. The weird problems with my ears only started after seeing this doctor. I would get very painful ear aches, draining, hearing loss, blisters on my ear drums. Very strange things, ALL THE TIME. I found out, that doctor was a graduate of Harvard, and from Harvard went into the Army, to be ""an army doctor"". I thought that was strange because as a Harvard graduate, he could have done anything but he chose the army, or did the army chose him? 
Not sure why I feel like this has anything to do with these things, but am hoping you guys understand. My brothers always suffered from terrible nose bleeds growing up, some of them my mom had problems controlling. She took my oldest brother to a doctor to figure out why he was having them so badly. I have a 13 y/o son who never reports hearing anything my daughter and I hear. My mom does not hear things either but someother strange things have happened. We have two thick copper wires you rub together as a doorbell (weird I know) one night it started going nuts and we find out the wires were twisted together. We tried to create rubbing against them, tried to find any logical explanation, but nothing. We don't have security cameras, but I have weird things happen with my car, lights left on inside of it that I didn't leave on, weird fuses blown, my keyfob sometimes will not respond to my security system. I've done everything, changed the battery replaced the hoodlatch, fuses, battery and had a mechanic go over my entire car. I keep a deer cam facing my car and have never gotten anything on it but BRIGHTNESS. No animals nothing. My family says I do these things and forget but I have witnesses to say the contrary. I know this can be explained entirely but I have yet to be able to. Weird electrical interferences? 
 "
338,I think I was trying to be abducted by aliens.,Abductions,8,"Before I go any further, I'm not a religious person anymore. I have a great job, girlfriend, normal life. This is very personal and something I try not to think about so I can continue to live my life.

I've had experiences since I was a child. I'm guessing this attempt wasn't my first time.

I remember going to bed around 10pm.  The time of the abduction or attempt is unknown.  I do remember a bright light in the window.  I feel myself being pulled away from my bed. I'm sleeping on my back.  I can't scream for help and can barely move. I now feel my legs dangling over my bed because I'm being pulled my something. Not hands, something else. (Only one side of my bed is pushed all the way to the wall.) As I'm being pulled, I managed to get my left hand to hold on the side of the mattress that is touching the wall. As I'm being pulled my mattress is coming off the box spring.  It feels like I'm dreaming right now. The attempt feels like I'm trying to be taken sideways as the reason why I'm pulling the mattress, holding on dearly for my life. Now the next attempt I feel myself float up, all the way till I hit the ceiling. ( My ceiling is white, very important  descriptionfor later ).

I'm being pushed up but the ceiling is in the way. I can't go any further up. I feel myself floating back down. From there I don't know what happened. If I fought it or I did get taken.  In the morning, I wake up to my mattress more than half ways off my box spring. At this moment I'm freaked out.  I do remember my head hitting the ceiling.  I go to my bathroom to check the mirror and I see the White popcorn stuff on my hair as someone would have if they hit the ceiling.

I'm stomach drops, I hurry out the front door to go outside. I'm unable to explain what happened.

This is the first Time I mentioned it here on Reddit. I haven't told my girlfriend or family. Quite embarrassing, as I don't want people to think I'm crazy. This is my past, but something I will remember always."

suddenly i was in my room again, it wasn't a dream, more like a memory that was flashed in my mind. it could be an allucination too, i had large doses of mdma during the the week in the carnival. i'd like to know if anyone has experienced this saem kind of memory.
ps: i live two blocks away from an UFO land strip, which was built by a famous brazillian ufologist. people used to go to that place to have encounters."
342,Looking for insight on event from 10+ years ago,Abductions,18,"Ok, so this happened awhile ago so stick with me. The incident happened when I was 9 or 10 years old.  2002-ish. My Mom (25 or 26 at the time), my two younger brothers (about 3 and 2) and I were driving home from my grandparents house. The road is mostly deserted, it's around 8 or 9pm in Catawissa, Missouri. There are houses around so it's not just vast, open land. We were turning into our subdivision at the top of a hill. My mom always waited about 3 seconds before turning because you couldn't really see who was coming up the hill. As we were waiting suddenly everything went white. Like a bright light. No sounds. Couldn't see anything but white. It felt like awhile. Not hours, but a few minutes. 
Suddenly I'm back in the car. We're in the same spot, the same minute, no time has passed. 

My mom said ""did you see that too?""

I said I did and we both described the same thing. 

We went home, we might have told my dad about it. I think my younger brothers were asleep?

It's not mentioned again for awhile. At some point when I was a teenager I asked my mom if she remembered and she did. I've brought it up a few times since but we both have no clue. 

Lighting hit the car? It wasn't storming. Abduction? Paranormal? 

Update: I just talked to my mom about it this again to make sure I had the details right. She described the same thing. 

Leaving grandma's around 8pmish, stopping at the top of the hill. Bright white, no sound, felt like floating almost. Definitely not aware of any senses other than seeing bright white. Same thing that I remembered. 

I really appreciate all of your ideas and speculations. I have been so curious about this for a long time."

344,Abduction or living in a simulation?,Abductions,5,"(This is my girlfriends experience who wanted me to share this on reddit) 

When she was 14/15 about 6 years ago now, she woke up to a bright light in her room and recalls reacting to the light and sitting up invoulantarily before waking at exactly 6:00 am without any alarms and was fully stood up and confused as to why she was there, which is pretty unusual since she is a light sleeper. Not sure if it relates to this but it is a strange coincidence that a few days later whilst sitting in her mother’s car on her uncles drive way at night,she recalls that in the street she saw what looked like a glitch in the sky,from what I gathered looked like a pixelated glitch.

Side note, years after whilst watching the film dark skies the scene where they’re describing having an implantation scar behind her ear she jokingly checked her own and found a scar to which she has 0 recollection of how it got there and has become inflamed on several occasions.

She wants to know if anyone else has had any similar experiences "
345,Greys and Trees,Abductions,26,"There seems to be some sort of correlation for me between aliens and trees, they seem to go hand in hand somehow.

I have dreams where they are standing among the forest trees talking to me, they hide behind trees in my yard during abduction dreams (though in the waking world my yard is purposely very devoid of trees), or their little ""scenes"" have tall white trees everywhere, though it's clear we are in some sort of cavelike place with no daylight.

I just read about the school children in Zimbabwe's experience Dr. Mack researched and ""trees will burn"" stuck out to me, I think that comes up frequently with their ""environmental disaster"" scenarios they show people. Also recall mythological nymphs dwell in trees also, I'm not sure if that's relevant or not though. I'm of the personal opinion ""aliens"" are just something more earthbound in disguise. I know many cultures all over the world throughout time have worshiped trees in some form or other. Maybe there is something else about them, besides their shelter, heat, etc. that others picked up on? Just thinking out loud. 

Just wondering if anyone else has a prevalence of trees, namely deciduous trees of the oak, beech, aspen variety, in their abduction experiences or dreams. My attention is always directed toward them, oddly. Didn't know if that was unusual or not. 

 "
346,Childhood Encounter on Video,Abductions,9,"Ok, so I'm not entirely sure when this happened, but from what I remember, it was sometime when I was in the 3rd or 4th grade back in the late 90's, so maybe 1997 or 1998. I had gotten a cheap camcorder for Christmas, and my mother was obsessed with recording UFOs with it. Granted, around 95% of the crap she would record was completely explainable considering that we not only lived close (around 30 miles) to a major international airport, but there was also an Airforce Base not far from the airport. My dad was, and still is a hard-core skeptic, and always taught me never to take anything at face value. Despite all of that, there were some things that she caught that no one could explain.

&#x200B;

Anyway, one night while my mother was recording a meteor shower along with some of the neighbors. At somewhere around 10-ish, we all saw something fall in a forest situated close to a mountain cliff several miles from our house. I know it hit the ground because there was a pretty loud boom like the kind that hits you when a massive firework goes off right above you. Our first thought was to call the police, but our neighbor, who worked at the base, told us not to call anyone and went inside. I think that he said he was going to call his Sargent, or superior. Anyway, we could all see a hole in the tree-line on the mountain where the boom came from. about ten minutes later, he came back out and told his wife that there was an accident and that he needed to head to work. We were all worried that a plane had gone down, so our other neighbor went in to check the news. I don't quite remember if there was ever any mention of something going down, though I haven't found any mention of a plane crash in the area during the late 90's.

  
We stayed out there for about another half hour before we all went inside since it was getting late. My mother was on the phone with my dad telling him what had happened and asking if he knew anything that was going on (he worked at the hospital). I've asked him about that night a couple of times, and he's always said that, apart from a few car accidents from the meteor shower, there wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Any who, I went into the kitchen to grab something, and in the window above the fridge, there was something looking in. I still get chills thinking about it even now. I don't know what it was, and I was too terrified to go outside to check, but the one thing that's just been burned into my mind is the eyes. I could see the outline of the head, and these big black eyes reflecting light back from the window. 

&#x200B;

I called for my mom and told her there was something looking in from the above the fridge. As soon as my mother saw what was there, she told me to go and grab the camcorder. I did exactly what she said and she started recording whatever it was. She then told me to call my dad and tell him someone was outside the house. I remember heading for the phone...and then the next thing I know, I'm pulling myself off the ground in the next room. My mother came running from her bedroom asking me if I was alright. I don't remember much else from that night, only that we couldn't find the camcorder after that. I still don't know what happened to it. 

&#x200B;

A couple of months later, we were at my aunt's house watching some of the videos my mother had made and discussing what everything probably was. Then we popped in the video from that night. The things that I saw were...bizarre, I guess. The video caught whatever was looking in from above the fridge, but then it looked like she dropped the camera. In the frame, we could all see my feet and legs laying on the ground in the upper left side. Even weirder, there was this clicking noise that was random, but also kinda rhythmic. The video ran like that for a good twenty minutes until it looked like someone off-screen was pulling me away and picking me up. The video continued on for about forty more minutes before the tape ran out. To this day, I have no idea what happened.

&#x200B;

I was more than content to forget all about this and just chalk it up to some kind of nightmare, but a couple of weeks ago, my aunt called me saying that she found bunch of tapes from when I was a kid. Since my mom passed away about six years ago, and there really aren't a whole lot of pictures or videos of her from back then, I was thrilled to have something of her. We watched a couple of them with her old DVD/VCR set, and then we hit the tape from that night. My boyfriend was confused and I just couldn't finish it. I told her to throw it out.

&#x200B;

I don't know what she did with it, but now I'm terrified to look at any of the other tapes that she made. "

348,"1st time occurance, Word blurred out of dream",Abductions,10,"I thought I should add this to the list of strange occurances: 

In one of my recent dreams a word was deleted.  In the dream a nanny was telling me about my parents.  ""Your father was a [word or words blurred]""

I don't know my natural father.  
It felt like another manipulated dream.
It felt like an alien had reached into my mind and blurred out words from my dream.  Like when a DJ scratches a record.   I have never experienced this effect before.  I don't like to think my mind is being manipulated, even my dreams, but I feel that my mind is being manipulated.  

I would have liked to know what the scratched out words were, even if it were only a dream."
349,I remember the light.,Abductions,11,"So.. I hate to have like the most typical story ever, and I'm not saying I was abducted or somehow dreaming or what.. 

So in either 8th or 9th grade, I had a loft bed in my room on the top floor of our split level house. I have 3 windows all on one wall that make one big window and my feet faced the window all the way to the right. Just as I lay down and close my eyes, I notice like a flashlight shining in my eyes. I prop up on my elbows and look out. We have a telephone pole in out backyard and so I immediately thought why are they up there shining a light on my face. It was level with my face. But we also have trees and I didnt see any leaves blocking the light even though it looked really far away. As I stared and questioned it, it looked like it was getting closer but the light was brighter.. and like pure white. I couldnt move and I remember just thinking ""it's going to hit me and I need to move now.""
And then all of a sudden I was awake and it was morning. I was in the same position on my elbows, still in panic but i wasnt tired. Like i slept the whole night.
I didnt know anything about aliens at that time. It wasnt an interest. Then when I had my son, I watched some documentary about implants and scars of people who claimed to be abducted.. i had a scar on my ankle i never knew how i got but i just never questioned it. It's like right above my ankle. A perfect line. I've gotten questions about it asking if I've had surgery a long time ago, but I've had nothing like that.
I have no idea if they're connected at all. Or if I was dreaming that night. Or if I had an injury as a kid that I dont remember. But i certainly dont remember that injury or a healing process. I dont remember what happened the rest of that night. I remember that light though and i remember how scared i was. And i dont remember anything like that afterwards.
That's it. Just wanted to hear thoughts. I dont talk about it normally so I was curious."
350,My Strange Experiences concerning Aliens,Abductions,7,"This a really long post

I spent a few weeks on an abductions reddit thread before I got the courage to post my own experiences. I honestly don't know if it's aliens, the government, spirits, or my own mind. I know that i've had several experiences.

Ever since I was a kid I remember being fascinated by anything paranormal, especially aliens. It all started when I was 5 (31 now) and I was in my parents room with my Mom and brother watching an alien special. The special showcased a mother who had apparently been abducted often. During one of her abductions, (she could feel it before they happened) she felt that this time they were coming for her kids too. She took her kids from their bedroom, and hid them in the closet and put herself in a spot where they would easily take her and just her. Well during this special I remember thinking to myself that this lady is being silly. All she has to do is deadbolt her doors. That's when the special showed the aliens unlock the doors from the outside without even touching it. This freaked me out. It scared me so much that I remember that fear to this day. It's funny now that i'm older, but as a kid, the idea that there could be things from another world to enter and leave your home as they please and take whoever they want for who knows how long was horrific.

Since this special I remember being terrified of the dark. I began to refuse (for years well into my teenage years) to sleep in my room. I would rather sleep downstairs in the living room where I wasn't cornered, where I could see them coming. What was odd was that my brothers and sister also preferred to sleep downstairs. I would have friends over and one (we'll call him Dylan) stopped coming over because as he claimed, he woke up on the dinner table sprawled out as if he was being operated on. Before Dylan stopped coming over we would always talk about UFO's and aliens and all that. One night while playing Mortal Kombat on SNES, he said he could see a UFO outside through the window (it was night at this time) I looked but couldn't see anything, but still got nervous. He could have been lying to me, kids do all the time anyways. However, I remember either later that night or another night he was over when we were imagining we were fighting off aliens on some distant world in my living room, I glanced to where the front door and stairs met and there was this huge glowing-white-alien-looking-thing reaching out to me. It stopped me in my tracks. I remember it clear today as the night i saw it. It's mouth was open as if trying to call me over while its left arm and hand were stretched to me with its right hand resting on the stair railing. We stopped playing after that and went to bed. Another time when I was at his house we were (you guessed it) talking about aliens again. Independence Day the movie had just come out recently and I was trying to explain what the aliens looked like when they didn't have the suit on to my friend and this is when I looked under his bed (since I slept on the floor in his room when I was over there) and saw an alien that looked just like the one in the movie. It was dark under his bed, but I remember telling it in my mind to stay under there. I remember seeing it (for a full minute or two before looking back up to Dylan). the alien's eyes glistened from the lamp in his room and stared back at me. I figured it must be my overactive imagination since we were talking about aliens, that there must be something under the bed that is creating this illusion. (I began to use to this rationale to dismiss a lot of experiences and still do to this day, but as I get older I do wonder). When I woke up, I looked to see what could have been playing tricks on me and found nothing that would have mimicked those eyes, at least to my memory and memory can be a tricky thing.

Fast forward to my young teen years and i'm outside of my house. Looking up at the sky wanting to see a UFO (I did this a lot) this night in particular though I scanned the night sky and saw what looked like a diamond shaped craft with the top and bottom flattened and two large rows of hug windows in the middle that separated the top and bottom halves of the ship. This thing was huge. about the size of 5 or 6 commercial airliners. I remember faint lights blinking from it. I stood there dumbfounded. ""Is this for real?"" I asked myself. I am super skeptical, even if I experience something I always try to rationalize it. Eventually I head back inside. Here's where my memory gets foggy, but i definitely remember being freaked out and asking myself the same questions. I remember the time being one thing, like 9:12 pm, but when I went back in it close to 10:12 pm. I had only gone outside to see for ten minutes it seemed. Was i outside for longer? I figured that I must have misread the time or stayed out longer than I thought, but it bothered me and still does. I really can't explain it.

Sometime after this, maybe a year or so, I am watching an Alien UFO documentary on TV that goes over like 10 or 20 UFO Hoaxes that happened. Eventually, I come upon the UFO that I saw. It fit the description perfectly. I believe they said it was two brothers that caused the hoax and they did it by projecting an image on a surface that would catch it. But there was nothing but some clouds and the night sky that surrounded this UFO. That never made sense to me, but it did help me put away my obsession for a long time as it was something truly terrifying to me.

As time passed by I would have bouts of alien obsession, but then they would go away. As I grew older I became more religious and this pretty much took me away from my obsession. I had had religious experiences or spiritual experiences if you will, all my life but as I grew older and began to understand what i believe was and is my relationship with God, I really didn't know where aliens fit (and still don't. In many ways I agnostic, but I am definitely am a Christian as I believe. I admit there's a lot I just don't know.)

During the middle of my most religious time when I was 19 I was asleep in my apartment in Bardstown, KY. My roommate and I shared a room as it was a one bedroom place, but had separate beds. I remember waking up one early morning. A sense of sheer fear washed over me. A coldness that is hard to describe. As if the warmth had left my body. I heard a strange sound. I've seen others describe it as a wobbling sound or a metal grinding weird screeching. Whatever it was, it was right outside my window and then I had the strongest feeling that I was not alone in that room with my roommate. I felt very strong that there were two beings at the door way. I'm not sure if I couldn't move because of sleep paralysis (which i have experienced few times in life) or if I was just that scared but I shut my eyes tight until the feeling eased away and I finally gathered the courage to look. Nothing was there, only the dark of morning. I could not get back to sleep and stayed up the rest of the day. I never told my roommate what happened either.

I had several more weird experiences, I won't go into them as they get pretty personal, but by the time I was 21 I began to feel that aliens and demons were connected. They shared the same fear the same freezing cold that surged throughout my body and spirit. (I have had multiple spiritual experiences as well in case that is not clear. Experienced exorcisms and healing on first hand accounts. It is these things that are too personal for me to delve into)

Its been over a decade since that night in Bardstown, KY, but I still wonder. Was I abducted? Was it sleep paralysis? I have a friend that suffers from it and he can affirm the crazy stuff he sees but he is never hurt. I honestly don't know. the more i've delved into the topic the more i delved into my religion and pondered about the concept of God. After years of thinking and swaying I've realized that I believe in God, I believe in Jesus as the Messiah. I just don't know what to make of what these other experiences I had were. I don't doubt there is life beyond our world. But i've always wondered what those experiences were and still do.

&#x200B;

TL:DR I've had various strange experiences ranging from aliens to demons to miracles that I am not sure how they fit.

351,Hmmmm,Abductions,14,Okay so how can you identify if you’ve been abducted? Me and my boyfriend last night were laying down laround 11pm and we both don’t remember falling asleep at all. I eventually woke up around 4am (still confused about passing out) all the lights were on and my boyfriend has a bruise on his hip I have two one on my arm and back. I’ve been trying to research it to see if I can come across anyone else who has maybe something similar happen. We’re both convinced it was aliens but I guess there’s no way to confirm it haha

354,Cat headed alien?,Abductions,12,"I used to lucid dream frequently and would mess around with it, until I had a few experiences with entities(all human) that scared me so now I just wake myself up when I find myself in a lucid state. So I was telling some of my stories to a few girls, one of which is a hardcore astro chick who spends all of her free time learning about all things woowoo. Anyway one girl asked if I had ever woken up lucid and not been in my bed, I said no but one time when I went to leave my bedroom, instead of the rest of my house being there there was a long checkerboard hallway and at the end there was a figure which was the body of a human wearing a long tan cloak/trenchcoat and the head of a blue cat. He was just staring at me from the end of this hallway and I did not feel threatened in any way(as I would with some entities). I was just thinking woah this is weird, we stared at each other for about a minute and I decided it was too weird to approach him and I woke myself up. So the girl who knows about this type of stuff goes ""that wasn't an entity, that was an alien"" and she goes on to tell me that her friend has a tarot deck that has drawings of the cat headed aliens and they are all on checkerboard floors. This girl is not a liar so now I am very intrigued by the whole experience and wondering if anybody has had experiences with cat headed aliens, or knows anything about them?"
355,I have so many questions...,Abductions,4,0
356,"All honest people are open, warm and friendly.",Abductions,1,"All honest people are open, warm and friendly.

Science that is driven only by data, and not by human competitive nature, is always open, warm, and friendly. The data always speaks for itself. There is no need for a defense of data that is real. Pride does not belong in science. When human beings tell the truth, they are friendly, cooperative, open, and warm. When human beings do not tell the truth, they are arrogant, defensive, angry, and competitive. 

This is how we sort out all the bullshit: human drama from data itself. Let the data speak for itself. Allow studies of consciousness to continue without character assassination (debunking over skepticism).

Skepticism is healthy. It allows for doubt, but also the continuation of seeking more data.

Debunking is hateful. It is doubtful and controlling. Debunking (being overly critical without reasoning) does not allow for continuation of seeking more data. Debunking is psychological control. This is not science.

In science - the data always wins. Data is independent of interpretation. With enough data, and with a variety of independent sources of data, the truth becomes apparent.

There is no anger in science. There is only friendship and honesty. Science is DRIVEN by logic primarily, and then by data. If logic is not sound (as in competitive in nature, and not data driven), then the data will also not be sound.

There is no authority or authoritarianism in science. There is ONLY data and logic - and that’s it! All data and all logic remain independent of the individual. Pride and science are incompatible.

359,I think I'm a hybrid alien,Abductions,10,I have red spots in the field
360,Horrible nightmares and episodes,Abductions,8,Since I was started to have trouble at home since I moved back into my childhood house I decided to travel for work. (Check my last post for details.) Since I have been traveling my nightmares have become more realistic and more “painful”. My chest aches more in the areas around the marks I still have. (Again check my last few posts for details.) I’m not sure why this has started happening again though I am becoming more and more terrified. I am traveling with my best friend (who knows nothing of what had been happening aside from the nightmares and marks on my chest) and neither of us have had missing time though we have seen strange lights in the sky several times. If anyone had any idea as to why this is happening or had an opinion please leave a comment. Please check my last few posts to get a better insight into my story. Please help and thank you.
361,Cross the Threshold,Abductions,5,"Minor experience in which a few nights ago I attempted to ""talk"" in telepathy to the horrid woman who transported into my bedroom years ago and viciously berated me.  So I spent yet another night making my nightly prayers followed by cursing out this horrid woman alien entity thing.  

As I am doing so my hand starts to redden, to burn and swell with those wretched little white bumps you get from allergic reactions.  It wasn't a bad burn, just very annoying and I had the feeling, I may be wrong but I did have the feeling, it was *them* again because of the timing.  Trying to control me once again, trying to punish.  Now this would be exceedingly minor if it were one of their ""punishments.""  I have been brutalized with a saw and other medical instruments by the mysterious entities so I do know what they're capable of.  5+ years later and I still remember the pain in excruciating detail.  Pain that stretched into the infinite and deeply damaged my psyche.
It's interesting when you research into the Targeted Individuals community, and I do all the time because it's the same sh-t that happens to me, so many people are saying this : *they burn me with a laser beam* or *they're making me sick* or how about *I'm getting v2k transmissions* (voice to skull auditory).

It's enough people saying it- some say it's people behind it, some say UFOs, some say FBI/CIA, some say supernatural.  But it's enough people by this point, that for all sensible people it is time to cross that threshold and say I'm not crazy, you're not crazy, something with intelligence is attacking us.  I've got a good head on my shoulders and all of you here, I know you do too, we are thinking people.  We are reasoning people who aren't limited in our thinking by what the status quo tells us is and is not possible.  The status quo brought us here, to a place of being *unprepared*, facing onslaughts of bizarre phenomena alone and threatened with every kind of sanction and ridicule if we dare admit something out of the ordinary happened.

It's weird, I spent the last few years so terrorized that they'd come back.  Keeping all my limbs tightly within the confines of my bed, terrified of being grabbed again in the night.  Like the sailor lost at sea on a life raft who carefully tucks in every limb as they float over shark infested waters knowing a stupid flimsy plastic raft is nothing, but clinging to it as if it could save you.  That is what my bed became to me.  

But I want them back now, because maybe I am getting stronger, maybe all the wrath has made me lose part of my fear and become more accepting of the prospect of death.   When the came to me I lost a whole lot, I lost so much hope but I was given one thing: information.  I saw for myself that these things are out there, felt their energy, experienced how they interact.  It was as much fun as being attacked by a pack of hyenas and the Max that emerged from those interactions is a maimed, traumatized, world weary Max.  But I saw things, I heard things, I learned about telepathy and the hive mind.  I learned that something in me is stronger than them, something in me that surprised them.  

Maybe I will find a way to be something other than the floating piece of meat they have known.  Nobody knows how to fight these things.  Nobody knows who they are, what they are.  Well it's time we figured that out mates, I don't know how but the clock is ticking, and somethings gotta give. I want to know what I'm up against.  

It is time that they come to fear *me.*  If they ever come back, I am ready now and I am a force to be reckoned with.

362,Was i actually abducted or is it just a vivid dream?,Abductions,0,"So approximately 1 year ago, i used to have these weird dreams. one of nights, i felt like someone touched me. i ignored it. another night i felt like someone just grabbed my head from top and called my name. i dismissed all of them as a case of sleep paralysis and a side effect of my smoking a little too much marijauna.  
but one particular night, i literally felt very awake. i have no idea what time it began, but i know it end around 4-5 am something. i suddenly woke up and saw someone .. but felt a weird kind of force that kind of pulled me towards my room outing and out of my bed. i saw a slight shadowy figure around the corner for a second. it was only for a very split second. the only thing i remember next is floating above my washing machine which is outside my room by in a very ""light feeling"" as if levitating. there was a very red light everywhere.

the only thing i remember is mild sunlight and me being back in my bed and feeling relatively calm.

PS... i felt myself floating as if, but also saw myself levitating in third person (in a red kind of light), but everything else was first person. it felt SO REAL.

Now i have had many sleep paralysis and lucid dreams.. i have them everyday and so much that they are actually very normal for me and welcomed always. but idk what happened that night. it was a very scary experience and i never felt anything like it before. nothing at all.

To help my case, i am attaching an image. its a hand drawn sketch of my room at that time with some locations in black pen. **black lines are solid walls that define my room.** here is what they mean **in terms of the numbers** they hold:

1.) the place where i felt two hands hold my head, as if ""embracing"" it and calling out my name. it was a terrible feeling.

2.) the place where i felt something grabbing me while i was faced towards the wall (blue lines are either walls or some kind of hard surface).

3.) the place where i saw a shadowy figure for a split second.

4.) my washing machine (just outside the room), above which i felt like i was levitating immersed in a sort of very red light.

here are some of the questions that i might get - with their answers:

1.) how old? -> 24 now, 22-23 then

2.) drug past? --> no. only weed and alcohol. nothing else at all.

3.) religious? -> yes.

4.) did it ever happen again? -> no never. only once and that was it.

5.) any marks on body -> no. none i could find (i looked for them after the incident, since i am a big interested guy into paranormal and especially aliens and stuff).

Please help. ask me anything u want to in DMs. i will reply almost immediately, please help me figure out - was it just very lucid dreaming or something real?

363,Strange Happenings,Abductions,19,"This is my first reddit post and it is long, so bear with me, yall. I've been with my husband for going on 5 years this year, and im pretty sure hes an abductee. I want to see if other people experience the same thing. First, hes had this scar on his back since I've known him, and had no recollection of getting it, its almost as if someone took a hot metal tube and burned an impression into him. Its no bigger than a pencil eraser, and almost in the dead center of his back, slightly higher than the middle(pic in comments if i can figure out how that works). Every 3-4 months he and I will have a small period of time, about a week, where we cant shake the feeling that something is watching us. We will have very vivid dreams and always wake up on the hour around 2-3 am. The night of the full lunar eclipse (1/20/19) he asked me to check his back because something was sore. I felt around and nothing looked wrong but when ii felt his scar he said it hurt. It was alot more pronounced than usual, like it was swollen. We went to bed that night, and around 2 am, I woke up from a dead sleep and felt scared. I turned to my husband and there was a humanoid figure looming over him. But the second I saw him, its almost as if I fell back into a trance and I woke up that morning with no recollection of dreams or anything else besides what I saw. Since then his scar has gone back to normal and i haven't seen anything. Has anyone else experienced this??"

368,LSD and possible abduction? Opinions,Abductions,8,"This was a few years ago. I was with my girlfriend at the time and her older brother and we decided to take some LSD. Now, it definitely wasn’t my first time. This time however was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.. it was like I was in a different world. It was horrifying. The fear is indescribable. I remember at one point “waking up” on a table surrounded by either scientists or aliens or beings. I’m not 100% sure as they were pretty blurry. There was about 6 of them surrounding me and I remember saying to “stop it and leave me alone” that’s when I heard “we will never leave you alone. This will go on forever”. I started to blackout after that. I remember them also saying that I had to think that no one would ever help me in life. That I had to do it all alone. God it was terrible. It was like my entire conscious was hijacked. Like my body’s lights were on but no one was home. It felt so real. Does anyone have any ideas on what this was? Sorry if I didn’t give the best description. After that I’ve had episodes where I black out and try walking through walls, and similar things happen. They happen somewhat frequently and neither therapists nor doctors have a real explanation."
369,"Not sure what to make of an experience last night, and looking for some guidance.",Abductions,10,"I had an experience last night I am having a hard time wrapping my head around. I don’t want to talk to any of my family or friends about it because I don’t want them to worry about me/my mental health, but it has stuck with me all day and I would really like to share it with someone and hear if anyone has had similar experiences. 

Full disclosure, I have had occasional sleep paralysis since I was a teen, but this was very different in a lot of ways: 

1) I woke up in the middle of the night and realized something was “off”. I sat up, put on my glasses, and reached for my phone (flashlight). Next thing I know, I was laying down and my glasses were back on the table. I tried twice, after the second time I guess I blacked out. 

2) What comes next is sort of confusing. I’m tempted to call it a dream, but it’s not like any dream I’ve ever had. All there was was darkness, and the sound of my own voice begging: “I want to go home. Please just let me go home.” I could hear myself saying the words, but I couldn’t feel words coming out of my mouth, nor did I know why I was saying them. I just knew that it was my voice, and I sounded scared. I didn’t see anything but eyes once, right in my face, but all fuzzy and out of focus. And, I know this will sound odd, but sometimes there was music. Just dark and music and the feeling of being watched. 

3) I remember two sensations. One was pain, it was a feeling like someone cutting from just below my naval, down in a straight line. It was the most sharp and real pain I have ever felt. And then I felt like I was floating in thick liquid, and I kept panicking because I was worried I couldn’t breath, but I could. 

This morning, I woke up like normal and went to work. It’s hard to explain, I’m so incredibly shook, yet I feel oddly calm about it too. Part of me believes it was nothing but a weird dream. Another part feels like, whatever it was, at least it’s behind me. 

What’s really odd is the detachment I felt the whole time. Listening to myself beg to go home, hearing the fear in my own voice, I felt scared *for* myself, but not actual fear. It almost feels like I watched something horrible happen to someone else, and all I can remember is the sound of their voice. Only, it’s my voice and I sounded more scared than I have ever felt in my life. "

373,Memory loss and strange markings on my genitals after losing my virginity,Abductions,0,"Since I was little, I've been having problems with memory loss and similar nightmares, but never had physical proof of an abduction. Recently, I moved away from my parents house, and it went better  for a while. But it returned yesterday when I lost my virginity. I had the worst nightmare in a dark room with strange lightings and strong pain in my abdomen, tubes in all my orifices, and woke up with a strange scar in my testicles.

My girlfriend was with me the whole night, and she didn't see anything. Which is strange because we both suffer from insomnia, and we both fell asleep before taking our medication while talking.

Notes: I don't know if any of that is relevant, but she was also a virgin, and I lived in a UFO sightings area here in Brasil. I will post the link to a pic of the scar in the comments, but I will reread the rules first to be sure I can do that.

The scars are 7 round circles, six of them forming a perfect rectangular shape.

Using a throwaway because friends browse Reddit.

Se slept with the AC on and the windows closed, but when we woke up, the windows were open.

Also, English is not my first language so please be patient.

374,The Real X-Files: Dr. John Mack & The Children of Ruwa,Abductions,2,0
375,"Strange, Wide-awake, experience two nights ago",Abductions,3,"Two days ago started like any normal day for me.  I was up at 4am and started my day.  I noticed I had a lot more energy than I've had in a long time.  Almost like I had drank a cooler full of Red Bulls, but without the jitters or anxiety of caffeine and other energy drinks.  At the time I chalked this up to my mood, as it has improved beyond belief since my experience 3 weeks ago.  I've even started working out again, to get rid of the weight I've gained over the last few years.  I haven't felt this happy and normal in a long time.

At the end of the day, I relaxed for a bit and played some KSP.  When bedtime came around I found myself staring at the ceiling unable to sleep.  I tried every method I knew to try and fall asleep.  I counted backwards by threes, counted sheep, meditation and just about anything else.  I contemplated taking some melatonin but by then it was so late in the evening that it would do more harm than good, since it knocks me out for a good 12 hours even at it's weakest dose.  I finally gave up and decided to watch a few of my favorite streamers for a bit.    

Around midnight I decided to try and get back to sleep so I went and laid back down with my wife.  I stared at the ceiling some more until I heard a weird sound.  It sounded like two deep toned rhythm sticks hitting each other, kind of a deep click clack sound.  I sat up and saw three creatures standing at the foot of my bed.  One was a Mantis though he was trying to hide it.  I could see through what he was wanting me to see, almost like looking through thin gauze, but could see his triangular head and multifaceted eyes clearly.  The other two were the Tall One who's always been there for my experiences, and a shorter one who was obviously very shy and nervous, and hid behind the Tall One, just peeking out.  

This is where I've been wondering if my experience three weeks ago was actually just a recovered memory, because I am sure the small one was the child that was presented to me in that experience, and she was much older this time.  About the size of a six year old.

I tried to wake up my wife but she wouldn't stir, so I tried to turn on my nightstand lamp to get a better look, but it wouldn't turn on either.  The mantis seemed a little annoyed that I was awake.  He pointed something towards me that looked like an old time TV remote, the kind that only had two push buttons on it.  I felt waves of sleep hitting me.  I would almost close my eyes to go to sleep, and then suddenly feel fully awake again.  Finally the mantis got annoyed, if his clicking was anything to judge it by and faded back into the shadows around the wall.  The Tall One seemed quite amused by what had happened, I also noticed that the child had left.  

When I asked him what happened to the child, he said she was curious about my children and went to look at them.  While we were waiting for her to come back he told me that he was glad that I had ""finally remembered how to be happy"".  I don't know if what he did next was either a deliberate or if I had somehow penetrated his screen for a brief instant, but I could see his face, which I have never seen since I began having experiences 27 years ago.  I've been trying to draw it, I can see it clearly in my mind, but I've never been very good at drawing what I see.  His skin was a greenish-grey and I'm almost certain he is a hybrid mantis, as his head was more elongated than triangular.  Slightly above the mouth were angular lines that reminded me of the mandibles of an insect, but tucked in close to the skin.  There were also semi-circular raised areas around the  left and right side of the mouth, the mouth was small, almost circular, with slight lips around it.    His eyes were and inverted teardrop shape, and were black, but very irridescent.  They  were not multifaceted like the mantid's eyes were.

Once the child came back into the room, I could tell she was still nervous about me.  Every time I met her eyes she would hide her face in the Tall One's robes.  I decided to lay back down and face towards my wife while I thought about how much I loved her and how happy I was to see her.  I tried to make sure I thought this very strongly so she might pick it up.  I jumped a little when I felt her touch my arm.  It sent tingles all over my body.  I had to focus on my breathing for a moment because my excitement was so great I felt like I was about to hyperventilate. I felt her trace the tattoo I have on my upper arm, and while she was doing this, it was almost as if I could feel what she was thinking.  I felt her nervousness that I wouldn't like her or accept her, so I made sure to redouble my efforts to push out a feeling of love and acceptance for her.  As her touch pulled away, I turned slowly over so I could see her, she was as beautiful as I remembered, her arms moved gracefully, as did her fingers, which were quite long.  As I was looking at he she just faded into the wall like the mantid did.  When I sat up and looked at the foot of my bed, the Tall One was still there.  He told me that I had done well and then he faded upwards towards the ceiling.  

I know this was not a dream as I never fell asleep at all that night, I was just too full of energy.  After they had left I went back into the living room and worked out for a bit, and then began editing a video I had been putting on the back burner for quite awhile.  I've finally broken down and told my wife about my experiences.  She reacted exactly as I figured she would.  She didn't say I was crazy or anything, but she just says she believes that I believe I experienced something.

I just feel so bad that every time I have an experience, I never ask their names.  It's almost like it doesn't need to be said, as if I know them so well that names don't matter.

376,Alien in my room,Abductions,6,"I remember being paralyzed in bed my head facing the door to my room when an alien that sort of looked like a grey came in. It had some bone looking structure around its neck which looked like it was keeping its head up. It had a disgruntled face and vibe to it, and judging by the door it must've been around five feet tall.

I've had very vague flashes of being abducted before, but still remain a very skeptical person in general."
377,My experience: strange visitation in bedroom on 12/12/18,Abductions,7,"My husband and I live in a 1 bedroom apartment in the 4th and top floor of our building with 2 dogs. Last week I woke up to the sound of the sliding glass door in our living room being slammed shut. I immediately sat up to see what was going on. Before I could get out of the bed I saw the silhouettes of 3 people with silver almond shaped eyes imposed over the silhouette in the center which was a bit taller than the other 2. I’m not sure if my eyes were closed, but this took up my whole field of vision.  I hear a voice in my head that says “Be calm, be calm, be calm.” It worked, I felt calmer and and I laid back down. I looked down to the small hallway at the foot of our bed that connects to the bathroom and I see 2 little people about 3-4 feet tall, a man and a woman I’d guess, but their features weren’t those of a fully developed adult. They were completely naked with whitish grey skin and had no genitals, they also didn’t have ears with only holes for hearing. The more male looking of the 2 was bald, the one I’d describe as female had shoulder length white hair. Her appearance almost seems like someone trying to dress up as a human but not getting the details quite right. They stared at me for a moment that felt like eternity before they ran down the hall to our living room. My husband was asleep in bed next to me oblivious and our dogs were asleep on the floor. 

   I got up and ran into the living room. No one was in the apartment. I went out onto the balcony and saw the little man’s head poking out our bedroom window looking at me. Naturally I ran back to the bedroom. No one was there except my sleeping husband and pets. I looked out the window and saw the little woman standing out on our balcony, still stark naked. I tried to yell “Hey!” To get her attention but my mouth was so dry from the anxiety of the situation that I couldn’t get the words out so I just waved instead. She waved back and her body language visibly relaxed. I went back to the living room and recall seeing them both standing together. I don’t know what kind of interaction we may have had after that. 

The next thing I knew I was back in bed and it sounded like there was an enormous wind storm outside that only lasted maybe a minute tops. I went back to sleep and woke up in the morning shaking. I told my husband what had happened and he said it must have been a dream as he knows I’m prone to very vivid dreams. This did not feel like a dream, it felt hyper real and extremely realistic and lucid. There was no strange dream logic and our apartment appeared exactly identical to how it did this morning. Usually when I dream about things happening in our apartment the layout is changed or the furniture is different. This was not the case.  I’ve had some anxiety about potentially seeing them again and some trouble sleeping. That’s getting better with time though. Today I recalled a brief vague memory of seeing the female looking creature in my bathroom with a large syringe. I feel like it is likely I will see them again, although I’m not sure why. It just feels like I have unfinished business with them.

382,"what weird or abnormal things happen after you’ve been abducted(physically, mentally etc), that never used to happen to you?",Abductions,17,"it’s seems common that when an abductee is around technology of any sort it sometimes stops working or malfunctions when they’re around. i’ve also heard clocks stop working too. the same thing happens to those that have claimed to have near-death experiences as well and i find interesting. 

just wanted to know what other abnormal things happen after an abduction that are common "
383,My abduction experiences.,Abductions,20,"This is my first time ever telling anyone other than my father at the time it happened, and my oldest son (11 at the time, who I told of my experience after he had almost the exact same experience except he was told to tell me about his) about my experiences, and will include what happened to me on Saturday night.

One night, in the winter of 1991 I am positive that I was abducted for the first time from my bed by extraterrestrials.  I remember waking up on a cold metal bed, naked and unrestrained, and seeing something moving in the shadows of the room I was in.  I don't know exactly what I saw, but it made me uneasy.  I got up from the bed and fled into a long hall.  Other rooms attached to this hall, and all had the same metal bed.  I don't remember seeing anyone in these other rooms, or what was in my room other than shadows moving.  I followed the hall to a large, brightly lit room.  There were several people in the room.  Tall and wearing brown and beige robes.  I turned to run the other way but ran right into another robed person who picked me up.  The next thing I remember is laying in my bed, in my room.  The robed person who had picked me up was in the corner and when he saw I was awake he leaned over me and placed something in front of my eyes.  There was a bright white flash and I was able to move and he was gone.  

Obviously on the surface of this, it seems like a generic nightmare with a night terror at the end, and that is what my father told me it was, but I've never believed it.  It didn't terrify me, I just felt uneasy because I was in a strange place with strange people, but never felt like these people meant me harm.  Since this experience I have been positive there are other beings in our universe, but I've never told anyone about what happened to me, nor have I ever before now sought out a place to talk about it or do any research since almost every abduction experience I have been exposed to in national media seems to involve the grey men and are frightening experiences which mine never were, so to be honest I discounted most of those kinds of experiences as being driven by the mainstream media.

In the years that have passed I have had several dreams a year where I was with these same people again, and I've never been sure if they were actual experiences or just dreams.  The tall people in brown robes have never spoken to me, though I know what they are saying, if that makes sense.  I have spoken vocally with other people who were with us and everyone seemed calm and friendly, almost like it was a gathering of friends.  I've often wondered if these dreams were abduction experiences, were these other abductees as they did not have the otherworldliness that the tall ones in the robes do.  I have never been given any messages to relate, or told anything about what is happening or anything at all like that.  It's always just been as if I was there as a passive observer or even a companion of the people in the robes. 

This has always been the pattern of the dreams until last Saturday night.  That night I was in a brightly lit room.  It seemed to be an extremely long rectangle, wider than it was long.  I was seated on square chair with no back and to my left was an area divided from the rest of the room with what seemed to be frosted glass.  I was presented with an infant that I was told was my daughter.  When I looked at her I felt a surge of emotion and love that I have NEVER felt in my life, even when I held my own sons, or married my wife.  It shames me to say that about my own family, but it is true that what I felt in this dream was so much more intense than what I feel for them.  She had dark brown hair that had a bit of curl to it.  He skin was a dark golden brown and her eyes were beautiful. Gold and shaped like large almonds. On her forehead was a spiral pattern of dark skin. I was/am so happy to have her as a daughter.  

I asked about her mother, and the nurse beside me kind of looked off to my right.  I saw in the distance a tall robed man standing beside another in robes watching me, I knew she was the mother.  She was shorter and more petite than the others in the robes and her skin was a very dark black.  When I saw her I also felt the same surge of emotion and love that I felt for the baby.  So much more intense than anything I've ever felt for a woman, even my wife, who is the only woman I have ever felt Eros for.   

The nurse took the baby from me and I stood up and walked with a robed man who always seemed to be beside me in these dreams.  I of course babbled incessantly about my daughter and how proud I was, and how excited my wife would be to meet her.  I also referred to the baby's mother as my wife as for some reason that's what I felt she was, and I was convinced she felt the same way.  

 Later I began to feel agitated and wanted to see my wife and child again.  I kept being told that I would see them soon and not to worry but I continued to get more and more agitated.  Finally I was told that a rule had been broken and that I must return home, but they would see me again.

I woke up and turned to wake my wife up to tell her about my daughter when I realized it was a dream/abduction experience, and she wouldn't understand.

I have thought of nothing else but my daughter and her mother for the last two days.  It's weird, but it's what prompted me to write this, to see if any others have had a similar experience to mine and maybe be pointed toward something that might help me understand

384,Wanted: Update on Armando Valdes abduction case,Abductions,4,"April 25 1977 - Chile - Platoon leader Cpl. Armando Valdes dissapears in front of his men's eyes after a UFO approaches his group. 15 minutes later he appears with several days of beard growth and a watch that reads 5 days later.

April 25 2002 - In an interview he says he wasn't abducted in the traditional sense of the word, he was not taken aboard a ship or anything, but said that during the experience he could see and hear his men the whole time, but would not elaborate any further, and said it would all be in a future book called The Shadow of Truth coming out later in the year, and the whole experience relates somehow to ""eschatology"" 

September 26 2003 - Again in an interview, he admits that he wasn't actually abducted, but the truth was actually more difficult to explain, more paranormal, but the beard growth and watch details were still correct. He then said that he's going to write a book explaining everything which was coming soon.

Today: I cannot find this book anywhere online, if it was ever published. So what do you think actually happened to Armando?"
385,Possible close encounter?,Abductions,2,"I had come home from an outing with my friends, we had been smoking pot for almost the whole time. By the time I got home, it had already worn off and I was understandably tired. I laid down on my bed and got comfortable. I dont remember drifting off, but i guess i fell asleep because I had what I thought at the time to be a dream. I ""woke up"" in a strange location, feeling like i was floating. I started to be able to make out my surroundings. I saw blue-grey metallic looking walls with no ceiling, where I could see a lot of stars. (I live in an area where the stars are very visible at night and these didnt look like the stars I see at night.) I saw a large alien with the stereotypical features standing over me woth what looked to be a collar like one you'd see on a king. I suddenly felt extremely calm and relaxed looking into his eyes, and I drifted off again. When I woke up, I was laying on the floor of my living room, when I checked the time it was 4:30 pm the next day. (I got home around 5:00 pm the prior day.) When i woke up it took me a good 30 minutes to remember where I was and what happened the day before.

This happened a couple months ago, and recently ive noticed that the left side of all earbuds ive used have stopped working. Is it possible these are related? Previously I've had no issues with earbuds."

This year a tall dark-skinned alien floated into my bedroom.  I could see him - - but I couldn’t - weird! He produced a Dull metal cylinder which squeaked, groaned and throbbed, which he thrust at me, sinking in to my body for a few seconds.

387,Possible Abductions in Cincinnati,Abductions,6,"There's some weird stuff going on in Cincinnati... About a week ago, on November 21, a local news station posted a really vague article to their Facebook page about a search at East Fork Lake by the State Highway Patrol because the Air Force contacted them about some signal they detected, but they found nothing. Here is the link [https://www.wlwt.com/article/what-were-officials-searching-for-at-east-fork-lake/25245584?fbclid=IwAR3INogzzWFw-p6orrXUk1as2LVl9pdKC3P5f-sZzrcskg0NrfzmoMgIpuU](https://www.wlwt.com/article/what-were-officials-searching-for-at-east-fork-lake/25245584?fbclid=IwAR3INogzzWFw-p6orrXUk1as2LVl9pdKC3P5f-sZzrcskg0NrfzmoMgIpuU). As I said - super vague. It's the Facebook comments on the post that say way more. A couple people mention seeing and hearing a jet going down. A man named Eddie Wichman has the best comment - he said he saw the jet at only 1,000-2,000 feet and he thought it was going to crash soon. He said he saw other people posting about it on Facebook too so he decided to call State Highway Patrol who told him about the Air Force's detected signal, which was from an aircraft emergency beacon, but it had suddenly disappeared. Here the link to the Facebook post if you would like to look at it [https://www.facebook.com/wlwt5/posts/10155605985646852](https://www.facebook.com/wlwt5/posts/10155605985646852). 

ANYWAY, here is where it gets interesting. Today I saw an article from November 26 saying ""Another search in East Fork Lake: Hunter disappears in woods"" ([https://www.wlwt.com/article/another-search-in-east-fork-lake-area-hunter-disappears-in-woods/25312516](https://www.wlwt.com/article/another-search-in-east-fork-lake-area-hunter-disappears-in-woods/25312516)). so I read it and then read the Facebook comments. I hadn't even made the connection about that being the location of the weird jet incident, but people in the comments sure did. Notice how the word ""another"" is in there - upon reading the article I discovered another person had already gone missing after his boat overturned a day earlier. Here's the article about that incident ([https://www.wlwt.com/article/officials-loveland-dive-team-dispatched-to-east-fork-lake/25300626](https://www.wlwt.com/article/officials-loveland-dive-team-dispatched-to-east-fork-lake/25300626)). 

These individuals have not yet been found. What are all your thoughts? Do you think they may be abductions? It all just seems very weird to me."

395,Possible Abduction?,Abductions,8," 

In all my years of scouring the internet, I've never come across another person who has experienced something like this, besides of course the friend of mine who I was with at the time. I posted this story to another sub-reddit about a year ago, but it didn't get much traction, I'm hoping to broaden the circle by posting it here.

So, about 4 years ago, I was at one of my best friend's house spending the night. She and I were sitting on her bed, with our faces in electronics, as most 12-year-old kids do. My friend lived full-time with her grandparents, and both she and I remember her grandmother coming in and telling us to get to bed soon, as it was 11:30. Neither of us planned on listening, as summer break had just started, but I did look at her alarm clock to confirm that it was indeed 11:30 at night. She and I continued to play on our electronics, mostly in silence because of her grandmother previously telling us to get to bed. She played minecraft on her phone as I played on of those geeky dating-sims on her DS.

This is where the glitch happens. I played a full route of the game with no bathroom or snack breaks. It only felt like an hour or so, and given my lack of needed to attend to myself, that's pretty understandable. My friend didn't get up to really do anything either. If my memory serves me right, she and I both barely moved. After getting done with a full route of the game, I asked my friend what time it was. I figured it was about 1 in the morning. My friend exited her app, and looked at the time. I remember seeing her eyes widen and she looked at me and told me in disbelief that it was 5:36 am. I laughed it off, but when I turned my head to look at her alarm clock, it too said '5:36 am'.

Since this, I have played that same DS taking the exact same route in the game, same copy and everything, while timing myself and it only took me 1 hour and 15 minutes exactly. I've never told anyone of this story before, and neither has my friend but we've both been pretty baffled for the last 4 years as to what happened that night. Almost every logical explanation can be ruled out, (Daylight saving only jumps ahead 1 hour, and this was like 4, I'm certain neither of us fell asleep without noticing, etc, etc). The only explanation that has ever stuck out to me was a possible alien abduction.   
I don't know how common a 'double' abduction may be, but what my friend and I have since come up with is the possibility of us being abducted, our memories being wiped, and then being put back in our exact places. This would make up for the lost time. Another possibility is that just one of us was abducted, with the other having their memory of witnessing the abduction wiped as well. I've posted this on two other sub-reddits, (mostly ones about unexplained experiences) but I thought this time I'd try and specialize it. "
396,Has anyone ever attempted an Alien Aubduction ambush/sting operation?,Abductions,16,"For anyone here who has studied the abduction phenomena, you will know that there are abductees who report being taken at regular intervals, Usually at a frequency on once every few weeks or so. This got me thinking, what if somebody where to hide somewhere close to abductee in question's house during the night and look for signs of aliens arriving to take the abductee? Potentially the Abductee could give the team an idea of what interval they are taken at.

If detected then they could zero in and interviene, confronting the aliens directly with tac-gear and heavily sheilded cameras and sensors (sheilding would be needed for the em fields the aliens use to mess with electronics) to finally prove the abduction phenomena is real.

If there was adequite funding I could potentially see there being a team of people large enough to block the Aliens ability to telepathically anesthetize the human body (due to overwhealming numbers, maybe 10-15 people) and there might even be potential to capture the alien beings by force and detain them. Has anyone ever had this idea or attempted to do anything similar to this?

397,"Generational Encounters with the Paranormal, UFOs and The Men In Black",Abductions,2,"Been a conspiracy nut-ball for over a decade now. The past 6 months or more I’ve been looking into alien abductions pretty heavy. It was a corner of the conspiracy world that I hadn’t really devoted a lot of time to yet. And as I started looking into it I thought wouldn’t it be funny if I started to suspect I’m an abductee just as side effect of spending a lot of time on these topics.

Well. I don’t suspect I’m an abductee but there is definitely something going on with my family. While I was looking into alien stuff I recalled my mom saying she once saw a ufo. So I was up visiting my family recently and asked her about it. She saw it in the late 70s or early 80s – I forgot to ask the exact year. Either right before I was born, while she was pregnant with me or right after I was born. At the time my folks lived in a country farm house out in the middle of nowhere Illinois. Dad was away on work. It was about 9pm and mom realized she had forgot to feed the dogs. She went outside, fed the dogs and looked up to see a massive black triangle ufo with 3 red lights (one at the point of each triangle angle). It wasn’t too far above the house. Made no noise. She said she stood in shock from seeing a ufo but even more so how massive it was. And that’s that. I believe she said it just slowly hovered away over the tree line and she went back in the house. I’ll have to ask her if the dogs ate like normal or if they were freaked out? See if she remembers that detail.

Also I recalled my mom and little sister joking about my little sister seeing “alans”. I asked them what they were talking about and they said when my little sister was 3 years old – several times she would leave her bedroom in the middle of the night and go into my mom’s bedroom.  Wake my mom up and ask to sleep with her because there were alans in my little sister’s room. Alans were what my 3 year old little sister called aliens. I thought it was interesting and worth mentioning.

On one of my trips up to visit my family a buddy and I were visiting with my dad. My buddy say’s to my dad that he actually knows some people who do paranormal investigating in the area where my dad lives. My dad said hey that’s interesting and wanting to hear more about it. Which I thought was weird, I never thought of my dad to be interested in the paranormal. While they were discussing this I spoke up and said, “Ya know if you actually experience the paranormal – ya don’t go looking for it.” Side note: I’ve had an ass ton of paranormal stuff happen to me but I’ve never discussed it with my dad because like I said I never took him for somebody who’d be open minded to it. My dad looked at me and said, “Huh, I’ve had one paranormal thing happen to me.” And he told us the following story. Starts off my dad is in the hospital and he’s dying. Side note: My dad has cheated death more than any other human I’ve ever met. For him to start off a story stating I was in the hospital dying is just par for the course. He said, Boys I was dying I was on my way out and there was no doubt about that. I had accepted my fate and the light in the room started fading out and a darkness started faded in. Just then two men in black suits and hats came in the room. They said, “Mr. Jones I’m afraid we cannot allow you to die at this time.” Then they walked back out of the room. My dad miraculously came back to life. A doctor and nurse came running in and said something to the effect of Mr. Jones you’re okay! You look amazing! We were not thinking you were going to make it. My dad asked who were the men in the black suits and hats? The doctor stated that he and the nurse had been right outside my dad’s room at the nurses station for some time and no-one had been in or out.

One of my earliest paranormal experiences is me and a friend seeing a 1950’s men-in-black style Cadillac disappear right in front of us. Also a year or two after that I was followed home one night by a mob of shadow people wearing suits, hats and trenchcoats – much like the men in black and or the shadow apparition known as the hat man.

Dr. David Jacobs an expert in ufology and abductions believes this phenomena to be generational. And that the paranormal and aliens are basically one in the same. Say your grandparents were abductees. Then it might skip a generation to where nothing at all happens to their kids. And then perhaps just one of the grandchildren experience paranormal activity. And the cycle repeats in ways somewhat similar to that example. Which I agree with that theory. Not that it’s an explanation for everything weird and paranormal but I do believe in some peoples cases the generational thing applies.

TL;DR: My family and I seem to have ties to the paranormal, aliens and the men in black.

398,Red diamonds with dots please help,Abductions,4,"As a child we stopped at a sleazy hotel in Atlanta Georgia in the middle of nowhere. I was about 9 years old.
All I recall is waking up with a sort of jolting conscienceness I have never felt after sleep. I got up to use the restroom and noticed markings on my arms. Looking into the mirror after exiting the bathroom I was pretty shocked. 
Red geometrical patterns traced my body. 
Very symmetrical with each other, I had red diamonds wrapping my arms covering my torso and onto my face.
No one believes me to this day but I have heard one similar story. It was about another young girl who had the same markings after being found in the fields at night yards from her home. She spoke of space and the ship she was aboard according to the teller.
I just need to know if anyone has ever experienced anything similar. 
Red diamonds, they are in a pattern from decreasing to increasing size. Maybe 5 before the pattern restarted. And from my memory I recall a red dot above and below the diamonds.
I can not find anything similar on line and I am reaching out to the Reddit community for help. 
For the record I am now 23 years old. And was traveling during the incident and have no recollection of where in GA I was."

When suddenly I’m jolted awake by disembodied voices, maybe like 10. When I open my eyes, my sight was like tv static, I don’t know how else to describe it. Suddenly a grey/green alien with black eyes grabs my eyebrows and leans over to look at me. He looked at me for a few seconds, and I can’t remember anything else. You can’t tell me this was sleep paralysis, I’ve struggled with that in the past. This was a visitation from aliens. This took place maybe a month ago. Why me?

405,Possible abduction?,Abductions,9,"I had an expierence around a year ago, and I’ve just brushed it off as a horrible case of first time sleep paralysis, but the more I think about it, the more suspicious I get.

So I woke up in a state of shock(Like from a nightmare minus the nightmare) and I was totally paralysed from head to toe.  I was laying on my back, slightly leaning on my side. I couldn’t even move my eyes, but they were pinned to the hallway(I live in a studio apartment so I have a clear view into the hallway from my bed).

The room was drenched in a grey light(I’m guessing this was around 3-4am based on everything around me), and that’s not normal at all. It’s usually totally black with maybe a little orange hue from the lights outside. My heart was beating really hard, but not extremely fast, and I was drenched in sweat.

In the hallway I see a tall dark figure staring right at me. I couldn’t make out any details, except that it was tall(2-2,5 meters based on the height of our ceiling) I would say it was totally black, but since the hallway was dark I really don’t know. 

I laid there with my eyes glued to it, it staring back at me, for what felt like an eternity, but realistically I’d say it lasted around a minute before I finally managed to tear my eyes away from it and I flung over to my other side and embraced my boyfriend. At the exact moment I gained control the tears just started pouring from my face, and I was shaking with confusion and fear. I didn’t have the guts(or heart) to look into the hallway again, but after laying there for a few minutes I started thinking and looking around(we have a bookcase at the foot of our bed so you can’t see the hallway from where my boyfriend is laying) and the grey, strange light was still there. The whole atmosphere was dark and heavy, and it almost felt like I was in another dimension if that makes sense. Everything looked like it had a black and white filter over it, and it almost seemed foggy.  I managed to fall asleep because of exhaustion after awhile, and when I woke up a few hours later to go to school, the apartment STILL had that eerie feeling, and I still felt incredibly scared and vulnerable. 

I’ve always had trouble sleeping, but after this it got so much worse. Not even because I’m scared or not tired or anything, but I’ll seriously lay in bed with my eyes closed for 5-6 hours without being able to fall asleep. 

I’m not sure what else to say. i don’t even know if it was an abduction, but it seems weird to me that the atmosphere was still like that if I was dreaming? If you have any questions or I failed to include something feel free to ask!

407,anyone have a similar memory?,Abductions,9,so this is something i kept to myself for a long time but it is a very vivid memory and feel like this could be something more then a delusion and that it might possibly of happened.  before i start i want to say that parts of this is hazy but i will try to keep to only what i can attest to being what i actually remember.    so starting out i was around 14-15.  didn't have much of a life at all outside of my family. they where pretty restrictive and didn't have any friends.  most nights we would be inside and id be in my room playing on a ps2.  but some nights me and my mom and dad and sister would sit on the porch in the back of our yard and watch a camp fire and talk.  id usually look in the yard for wood as they talked and walk down a path in the woods to a old tree house. but the night that im about to discuss went different.  so my sister was sitting next to the fire and my parents sat more near to the back door. i sit next to the fire opposite of my sister and the fire is about to go out and all you really see is the  embers still burning.  at this point im starting to look up at the night sky. it was a really nice night and you could see all the stars. no overcast or anything.  it had to be around 10-11 pm  that this happened but i remember as i looked up at the stars this thing. this object i can only describe as being fully black except for 3 circular orbs that where the same white as the stars i was looking at making a triangle formation flew from the woods to the other side of the house  it looked like it was just a few feet above the treeline and looked like it was almost the size of our house. i could tell this wasn't just three lights tho because as it went over the house it obstructed the view of the stars while also making a light hum. once it goes over the house i hear my dad say what was that. and a few seconds later the thing comes back right to where my dad was. this time it was faster but stopped suddenly  right above him and the humming stopped. the next thing i new this light emitted from one of the orbs and illuminated my dad. my mom screams and then a light is shown on her. i get up and start running along with my sister who is in front of me at this point screaming louder then y mom as she ran away from the house and this thing.  im almost caught up to her as a light hits her as well and she stops dead and drops to the ground.  i turn to the right and head towards the front of the house to the road. i then see a light coming from the woods across the road i turn right again towards this bush and tree we have in the front yard. a this point im starting to pant and then right as im halfway between the bush and the house a white light hits me. i feel weaker as im bathed in the light. like gravity or something got heavy. i fall and then everything goes black. i felt like i was still trying to run as i was on the ground and then that's all i remember from that night.  now iv'e always thought of this as a nightmare or night terror but i recall the next day. at least that morning. i remember waking up outside the side of my face to the dirt  and drooling. i shiver and kept up and walk inside the front door. it was around 6 or 7 pm and i just get into bed and sleep for a few more hours. i wake up around mid afternoon and recall the night. at this point i was a little freaked out because it was so vivid. but i had vivid dreams before and thought that it was just a new one. but unlike my other vivid dreams. this one only happened once.  im 23 now and i feel like its tie to share this. when it happened i was in Georgia.  general location was bellow Athens if anyone feels like they might of seen something around this time or anything it could of possibly been.  i don't know if this was all a dream or real. but if anyone else had a memory of something like this maybe i can find out if it was more then a dream.

409,Old encounter with a strange creature,Abductions,54,"I don’t have any memories of being abducted, but I don’t know where else to post alien related stuff. If anyone knows of any good subreddits for alien encounters, please let me know!

All my life I’ve had encounters with ufos and alien related stuff. The first time I remember seeing a ufo I was around 6-7, but no ones ever believed me. Of course I’ve gotten support from other believers, but none of them have taken it as seriously as I have. It doesn’t help that I’m scared shitless by aliens and all that stuff(so of course I’m more exposed to it than others lol).

But I wanted to ask about a specific encounter that I had when I was around 9-10 I think. My childhood years are really fused together age wise, so I’m not 100% sure but again I think I was around 9. I remember it super clearly, so I’m sure its not a made up memory. I have had many of those too, so I know the difference. I remember the fear I felt, the conversations I had, where I was, where I was going, who I was with, so it’s a totally clear memory.

I was with my Mom, her husband and my little sister. We were on vacation in northern norway because I have family on an island up there. We had rented an apartment by the water(by the docks i guess?)and behind the apartment building(two story) was a grassy hill that stretched far along the road from the house to the main road, approximately as tall as the house, covered inn tall grass and straw. One afternoon we got in the car to drive to the store, and I sat on the side that was faceing the grassy hill. 

We started driving, and like 10-20 meters from the house, on top of the grassy hill, stood a seemingly small creature. It was a beigey-grey colour, huuge black classic alien eyes, and this could be my head messing with me, but it looked like it had fur all over. The head was round, and the body also looked pretty rounded. Kind of like a snowman. I couldn’t make out any limbs, but as I said the hill was covered in tall grass, and of course I was in a moving car so I could’ve just missed it. It looked like it could have been around 1 meter tall. 

It was staring at me while we drove by and I was immiediately struck with a sense of fear and dread. I asked my mom if she saw it and if we could turn back but she didn’t believe me, and when we came back it was gone.

I want to add that my whole life I’ve felt like I was being watched. I’m very paranoid by nature, so I don’t know if thats a product of feeling watched, or vice versa. I also struggle with some mental health issues, but nothing related to hallucinations, plus those first came around age 12.

I don’t really know where I’m going with this, but I just want to share it with the community and maybe find someone who has seen the same creature. People I have shared this with always tells me that it was some sort of animal, but what fucking animals have they interacted with lol. I still get a sense of dread when I think about this, so I just want to hear what everyone else thinks about this encounter.

I could provide you with some sketches of the creature if my description is confusing, so just let me know.

412,i'm coming to you guys with this.,Abductions,22,"my theories are very terrestrial by nature. i'm one of those ""jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams"", ""charlie manson was a subject of MKUltra"", ""more rain? dammit HAARP!"" type people... a regular jack off. i'm very skeptical but haven't ventured much out of the ordinary as far as conspiracy.

this occurred a year ago, and it still bothers me when i think about it.

anyways, a former-coworker learned this about me and he told me he was into ""way crazier shit"" than me. i told him, send me links, show me what you got, i'm game. i have the the day off, so i spend time watching these videos he sent me. subject matter includes: giants frozen in ice, angel genetics, the Hadron Collider being used to open demon portals... this shit is a bit too out there for me, little too wild... something that stood out to me was some videos he sent me about the moon; different theories about it not being a moon at all, but a hologram, or a space military base, etc. to me, that is not outside the realm of possibility. so i sit on it and think about it and inevitably become very paranoid and feel like i'm now on a list somewhere and shouldn't have watched the videos.

that night - not sure what time, but it was fully dark - i was trying to sleep but the moon was shining insanely bright the window. no matter where i moved on the bed or how i changed my line of sight, i swear to fuck, the moon would within seconds be back in front of my closed eyelids. i'm fighting this for a good half hour and then it happens again, i open my eyes, and the moon is c.l.o.s.e.r. to my w.i.n.d.o.w.... the next few times it occurs i swear it looked like it got unnaturally larger/closer every time. it made me so afraid that i ended up paralyzed with dread, and i couldn't stop thinking ""they know, they know that you know."" i don't remember what happened after. i don't remember falling asleep. i remember waking up in very early morning, but that's it, and i got blackout curtains the next day and started not thinking about it.

some of you seem to know about things of this nature. what's your take on this experience?


TLDR: moon seemed to be consciously ""following"" me, changing size/coming closer very rapidly. hoping it's just a paranoid hallucination."

414,Abductees what psychic experiences have you had?,Abductions,16,"I started to think about the connection between psychic abilities and abductions when I read about a girl that was contacted by the entities after she used psychic abilities to find a missing crashed (plane, bus, something, can't remember).  She claimed the entities tracked and tested her to find the source of her psychic ability.

I recalled a psychic experience I had years before I had direct contact with the beings.  It was in school, my classmate.  Over time she started to radiate this energy that was overwhelming me.  It was an energy of death, I don't know how to describe it but it was an extremely powerful sad like presence whenever I was in the room with her.  She was a very intelligent and kind person.  But as several weeks went by the energy got stronger and I found it harder and harder to be near her due to the death energy emanating.

It was about a month after the energy started I saw my friend one last time.  Biology project in the basement library.  She was cheerful.  I wondered that she couldn't feel the sad energy like I did.

Couple days later I listened to the radio getting ready for bio class.  There was a car accident fatality in the rain.  I didn't draw the connection until I showed up at class, her desk was empty, I started to realize, then professor confirms it.  When I went home it hit me really hard, and I cried so hard but I didn't know why, as I hardly knew her.  

That premonition was my first strong psychic experience.  

I wonder now....if it's part of the reason I've been under attack by the beings.  "
415,Any other abductees remember feeling panic attacks when first exposed to pictures of greys?,Abductions,20,"I know I was. I remember watching a documentary on the subject with extended family at my grandma's house when I was 11. I started having a panic attack because of the drawings and I remember standing outside while my relatives were telling me that it was okay, it wasn't real. My abduction experience (at least the one I can remember) was from when I was four.

For years afterward, I had trouble looking at anything with any depictions of greys. I had to really build up my courage to watch a video taped documentary my grandma had made on abductions, and I had to remove the book cover of her copy of Whitley Streiber's *Communion* in order to read it (as you could probably guess, she was a big afficionado in all things paranormal). 

Anybody else have the same experience?"

Hi all, I’ve been involved in this community for a year or so. I'm an abductee with a story and after my own incident, a couple of years ago, I began getting in touch with fellow abductees from around the world. I recently published this book. I thought I’d leave it here as a while back, a couple of people asked me a bunch of questions about it."
417,Questions for Abductees Regarding Lifting Beam,Abductions,5,"A question for those who have experienced abduction events where a beam lifts them through objects such as out of bed and through walls or a window. 

- What color is this light? 

- Does the light have an origin point in the room - such as the ceiling or elsewhere - or is it all pervasive?

- Have you ever worn a watch, mechanical or otherwise, during an event? "

420,A New Approach To Verifying Abduction Events,Abductions,6,"I believe nearly everything reported about UFO behavior can now be explained with open source journal articles. If you think. I'll give an example from abduction phenomena.

Beams of light which seem to slow down time, move animals or people like a Star Trek tractor beam, and even move people through solid matter like glass windows... I think this can be explained. I point you to this chart:

In Puthoff's paper: ADVANCED SPACE PROPULSION BASED
ON VACUUM (SPACETIME METRIC) ENGINEERING

https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1204/1204.2184.pdf

Pay particular attention to to the section on ""energy states"" of matter in that chart. I've never seen this effect revealed before in any open literature, and I believe it also explains much of what's reported. Here's what Puthoff has to say:

> ""For engineered spacetimes associated with advanced craft technology in which [expansionary space-time effects occur relative to an outside reference frame at rest] a craft’s material properties would appear “hardened” relative to the environment due to the increased binding energies of atoms in its material structure. Such a craft could, say, impact water at high velocities without apparent deleterious effects.""

An expansionary space-time field (repulsive) projected from an object would have a twofold effect. One, everyone knows about. That is, pushing matter away and creating a null region around its surface such that turbulent wakes are removed when traveling at high velocity. So, no supersonic shock waves propagating out in its wake. But also, a hardening of matter inside the affected region of an expansionary warp bubble. Such that solids external to the object might react as fluids as well. Explaining how such things not just dive into water, as Puthoff points out, but also solid ground, rock, volcanoes, maybe even the sun. Such as seen in this claimed Soviet UFO crash:

https://imgur.com/a/rpmmU4Z

I don't want to debate whether this image is real or fake. It illustrates my point regardless.

Now, assuming what Puthoff wrote is true, suppose it were possible to generate a coherent beam of expansionary (relative to vacuum) gravity waves. There's been considerable work on sonic and laser based tractor beams in the open press. Here's one example:

https://phys.org/news/2015-10-sonic-tractor-video.html

Note use of phase conjugation to project dynamic holographic fields of force in a fluid.

Combine these two concepts and a gravity tractor beam pulling people through solid matter - like glass - might be explainable. And it might be that glass is particularly well suited to this application due to its viscous nature.

Attempts have been made to hide cameras in abductees' homes to no success. The cameras fail. Or people turn them off right before a claimed abduction. Anyway, projecting regions of high static potential to cause electronics failure is also commonly reported, making electronics unreliable. Here's a low tech proposal:

Have panes of glass made with ink cross-hatch patterns embedded like graph paper. Install those in place of normal windows at a subject's home. If such a gravity 'tractor' beam were in use, as a solid object (like a person) is pulled through the glass it may deform those hatch patterns and leave a permanent mark.

That's a good idea.

I think Puthoff either screwed up or was allowed to release that tidbit about the potential for controlling atomic energy states available to anyone with warp drive technology. That's a big deal. And it's hidden in plain sight."

424,Cats and interdimensional/extraterrestrials,Abductions,25,"Anyone else have personal experience? One night, they controlled my cat in his sleep, and got him to slink off the bed. Seeing him act like he was barely alive, sliding off the bed that way, I jumped up, concerned-- long story short I saw why. He was between me and them.

Then last night, they announced themselves again. They like Sunday nights, which is obnoxious. The thunder booming over the house strongly encouraging me to go to bed, as per usual. Along with some other odd things happening... they were waiting, and they don't like waiting. Ok fine, I said. 

But this cat (there are 4) refused to go to bed. He never, ever missed a meal. Come hell, hurricane, or flash flood. He bullies all the rest off their food at any chance, and he knows they only eat dinner in the bedroom. He refused to go to bed. So I picked him up. Once in the room, he still refused to eat, and cried incessantly at the door to get out. 

I hear people say their cats do this. Mine do not. Ever. This has been the schedule for years. Subconsciously I know they protect me from things at night, so they always sleep with me. Once, I even had one pounce on my chest, only to wake up and see a shadow in the room. 

Last night, he knew they were here too, and he was terrified. But he's never been afraid of them till now. He's never been afraid of anything. Something must have happened the last time they were here.

I let him out of the bedroom like he wanted. And I put his food outside the door with him. When my alarm went off at 530, I opened the bedroom door again, and he suddenly scarfed his food right then, which had been untouched all night. I've never seen any of my cats act like this.

Does anyone else's cats have a fear of ""them?"" "

428,I saw a ufo in Arizona at exactly 3 AM,Abductions,8,"I am currently on a road trip from our home in Palm Springs California to Austin Texas with my boyfriend. At this point in the night we were driving for about 6 hours and we stopped in this middle of the nowhere town in Arizona called Eloy. The only thing in town that we can see is a gas station and miles of field land with zero crops and barely any light pollution so the sky was absolutely clear that night. 

Our asses were numb from the long drive so we went and got gas and drove out into the nothingness to get stoned without being bothered. Keep in mind we habitually smoke marijuana. So we realize there is a completely empty dark field we can drive out into without being bothered (a good smoke spot). We drive about a mile out into the dead pitch black field and we see a white owl perched and it keeps moving and moving staying in our sight as we move about a mile into the dark field. We appreciate the owl and think nothing. 

Finally, we set our lawn chairs up in the black field and smoke a couple bowls. Our eyes got used to the moonlight and we could see the night sky clearly.  Suddenly, we hear a pack of coyotes from all directions yelling and yelping in synchronization. It scares the shit out of me so I run into the van and my boyfriend follows me trying to comfort me about the coyotes. 

So my boyfriend gets into the van and we are both sitting and we see a large seemingly thin and black triangular morphing aircraft. It had four lights with one bright headlight shined on us in the sky. It makes little noise, almost as if it could hover effortlessly. 
It flew over us very very swiftly and so close to our van that it made air rock our van, but it was a silent flying aircraft. It flew over us, then away, then closer until it finally stayed in one place as if it was observing us from a distance. It still looks like it’s morphing and it still had a bright headlight. 

We look at our car clock at it is exactly 3 AM California time. So the time was around 4 AM in Eloy Arizona. This was the moment fear came over my body. My boyfriend and I looked at each other and decided not to record what we are seeing because we do not know the intelligence of whatever was observing us and it would’ve been clear as day on camera that it was a ufo. Whatever it was could’ve had the power to pick us up in it’s aircraft. 

At this point I’m freaking out and the flying craft is  still morphing and seemingly observing us from afar. I begin praying and my boyfriend starts driving out of the dirt field. My boyfriend told me to keep an eye on the headlight and to not look away. The ufo followed us very slowly getting closer to us the whole mile out of the field until we hit the empty road again. As we finally get onto the road, it slowly followed us as we drove back into the lights and gas station and civilization. We saw the aircraft from even further now still observing us. I was shaking and  hysterically laughing and my boyfriend became alarmed. We sat and got ourselves together at the gas station, then left town. 

My boyfriend and I tried to place logic on the situation saying it could’ve been a drone. We both know that technology isn’t advanced enough for the aircraft we saw so close to us. The coyotes started yelling and reacting about a minute before the experience and maybe the owl was there to warn us, although it was hypnotizing. Why was our clock at exactly 3 AM when we noticed the flying aircraft?

Lets discuss..
Anyone with similar experiences?
Could I have been abducted? I haven’t noticed any marks on my body. We felt very out of it after seeing the craft. "

432,Was I abducted?? Alien handprints...,Abductions,1,"I've had all sorts of supernatural experiences throughout my life but this was my most baffling and mind boggling experience YET!  I lived in this townhouse that had a lot of ""activity"" when I was around 8 years old,  I'm 31 now and still deal with supernatural things happening to me.  I would constantly sleep walk in that townhouse which was unusual for me and my mom heard a party full of voices in my room when she fell asleep in there one day.  I don't remember anything unusual the day of the incident but I pretty much woke up with handprints on my legs.  They were three,  different sizes and all with four long, thin fingers.  It was as if the hands were still on my legs.  I was scared but I didn't tell my mom while she was getting my bath ready.  I went and got in the tub and the water wouldn't cover the handprints.  It covered the rest of my legs but not the handprints.  So I started to freak and screamed for my mom.  She ran in and saw the handprints and they immediately covered over in water, formed bubbles and the bubbles quickly floated to the surface and the handprints were gone.  It just doesn't make logical, physical or scientific sense.  The handprints just stayed there, not going underwater as if the hands were still there.  I've scoured the internet but haven't found anything remotely close to what I've experienced.  I just keep wondering if I was abducted because the handprints looked alien in nature and it was as if three different sized beings had been holding my legs down at some point leaving their handprints and maybe some type of chemical that didn't want to dissolve in water until my mom saw them.  I want to remember what happened that night but I'm weary of hypnosis.  Any thoughts?"

What do you folk think of this technique? Would you try it, if you had fears something was happening?"
435,If you start hearing voices,Abductions,4,"My advice to anyone who starts hearing voices:

*It started happening out of the blue for me, it had never happened in my childhood then happened a few times, maybe 5-10 times, and has not happened again since

The most clear instance I remember was suddenly hearing a man and woman telling me ""We think you're better off where you are"" 3 or 4 times over.  I heard the voices crystal clear in my head, I knew it was only being heard by me.  At once it felt extremely close, like it was coming from a listening device in my own brain, and simultaneously billions of miles away.  I'd heard before about people hearing voices but had thought it was their own head playing tricks on them.  What I heard was clear as glass and did not come from me.  I had been having visits from the beings.  Then a couple times while waking up I heard the voices.  I heard a man's voice singing ""heeeelllp them, heeelllp them.""

Anyhow, if you start hearing voices it will be a shock because you will never have imagined what it is like, to know someone is speaking to you who no one else can see/hear.  You are in a very vulnerable position as you not only have been thrown out of your element but have no way of knowing whose speaking to you, what their motives are, and fact checking information that's being fed to you.

My first response was to be shocked yet not shocked at the same time.  Part of me knew the beings were out there and could make contact with me at any time.  I felt violated, like a radio had been implanted inside my head. I felt angry that if I told anyone I'd just be written off as ""schizophrenic"" and discounted.

My first response was implicit and absolute trust toward the voices.  They seemed nice and powerful.  They seemed to care about me.  I was desperate for someone to care about and save me.  I'm becoming a muselmann. Finally someone had noticed.  I thought they were like gods or angels and could do just about anything.
It never occurred to me that they could be evil, lying, manipulative, hiding and distorting information, *exploiting me*! 

Anyhow it's taken me years to process the events and I now see through wizened eyes.  You don't have to give your trust, your mind and body over to mysterious beings because they've started contacting you from what seems to be deep space or ""heaven."". You don't owe anyone your implicit trust especially beings who won't even visit earth, who won't even let you see them.  What are they so afraid of and why do they have to hide?  Being that won't even set foot in your world because they don't want to be hurt, yet allow you to be hurt.  Beings that want to sit back in safety while giving you orders to fulfill for them.  Beings whose voices make them seem so beautiful and caring and powerful, and yet...

I never heard from them again.  I continue to waste away in pain, a muselmann still.  I continue to be afraid and lonely.  They didn't do anything for me despite having technology beyond my dreams, communicating across the galaxies into my own ear, and I realized...

The beings did nothing on the Holocaust.  They didn't evacuate anyone on 9/11.  They let innocent kids and animals die every day.  They let me waste away, sometimes it's hard to walk because it hurts, and I had at one point been ready to do anything for them, because I thought they were my friends...

But a book series called *The Silo Series* by Hugh Howey taught me wisdom.  It taught me that when you live in a bubble and don't know it (as I always have) people from outside the bubble could find a way to start contacting you.  At that point you think you're talking to god.  You think ""I'm saved!!!"". What doesn't occur to you is they could tell you anything, anything they wanted about themselves, about life outside your bubble, and you'll fall for it, because you've never been able to see outside your bubble.  They can tell you they're god, and you believe it.  They can start telling you what to do, how to think...

And eventually you start to wonder, why does ""god"" hide himself?  Why does he never come here?  What is he hiding?

437,Pretty Sure I Was Abducted By Aliens,Abductions,1,0
438,alien abduction experience I had during my first year at uni,Abductions,10,"I haven't really shared this with many people, and when it happened I wrote down the date in my diary. I had people refer to this as an astral abduction.

November 27/11/2017

So basically when I started my first year at uni I lived on the campus in my dorm room and moved in around late September. Uni life was going normal and fine but around the last week of November I started feeling really hazy in reality and my phone and laptop would randomly start acting up. Couple days before the incident I remember being woken up during the middle of the night by a huge blinding light and I got out of bed to open the curtains to see that it was broad daylight, and my window which usually faced the courtyard of my dorm halls was on the opposite side, facing the road the leads to the forest (my uni is in the countryside). Being weird enough as it is I looked up at the sky to see a cube-shaped UFO hover a bit above the trees before fading away from sight. I blacked out after that and woke up in bed in the actual morning. I brushed it off as being a weird dream. 

The day after that when I was walking around campus I kept seeing alien imagery, although in really mundane circumstances (e.g. alien head prints on a girl's backpack). Then I remember walking to my morning lecture which was on documentaries (I study film), and the one film they decided to screen happened to be about alien abductees. I remember getting really weird feelings the whole time watching it, and I kept thinking about leaving the lecture early because I was uncomfortable for some odd reason. After the lecture finished I was walking back to my dorm with a friend from my course (we'll call her A) and since the both of us were tired we decided to meet up later and go back to our rooms for a quick nap. When I entered my dorm room I changed into a t-shirt and went to bed and fell asleep almost instantly. And then it happened.

I entered a hyperrealistic dream where I found myself walking across my uni campus to get to the main square, but the whole place felt off and eerily empty, except for the fact that I saw two of my friends sitting on one of the benches outside the library. Since I recognised them I started to walk towards them but I noticed that the sides of my vision started to blur with a soft white edge and as I got right up close to them the scenery changed into a strange white tiled room. My friend J (a guy) and T (a girl) had a weird pallid expression on their face, it seemed really artificial. 

T turns to look at me and says, ""oh hey cicixkitty!""  
J looks at me dead in the eye and asks, ""cicixkitty, aren't you psychic?"" (note: I do actually practice divination)

When he says the word ""psychic"" his voice distorts and it actually hurt my head a little. I turned to the both of them and said, ""Yeah I mean, I guess I am, why?"" and then out of nowhere i'm hit with an excruciating pain that starts between my eyebrows and expands to the middle of my forehead. Before I know it, i'm becoming blind. I kept screaming at them to help me and that I can't see. Before I go fully blind I saw their forms distort and change into some tall, pale humanoid beings; all in the space of two seconds. And then suddenly I see a blue light - the brightest light i've ever witnessed - appear in front of me that starts as a small hole and expands to my whole vision. I started to really freak the fuck out and I kept trying to force myself to wakeup but it seemed that no matter how hard I tried none of my attempts were working, so I eventually gave in to the light and got immediately zapped through it and felt the pain travel through my forehead like a continuous rope, if that makes sense. 

Then I began to hear a humming that got louder and eventually boomed into a deep bass sound that went backwards and forwards like a wave. I could see the galaxy all around me and it felt like my body was going to be torn apart by the vibrations. I then noticed a crowd of massive beings - blue in colour but transparent enough for me to make out the stars behind them. They had huge heads and all of them had a ray of blue light emanating from their forehead and it travelled into mine. I felt like I was being ""downloaded"" information into my brain through that light but the whole thing was so sudden I couldn't bring myself to stop freaking out and I remember trying to tell myself to wakeup. Eventually I was so resistant towards them, I felt a sudden drop and my vision shifted into me being inside a red tiled room. It was completely empty but there was water dripping from the walls. I kept running around the room in panic and slapping my body to wake up and after what seemed like forever, I finally did.

When I opened my eyes, it felt like I had just fallen to earth. My head was dizzy and my vibrations low. To snap myself out of it and get back into ""reality"", I decided to check for text messages on my phone. Except for the fact that when I pressed the home button, the entire screen was transparent and there was a rainbow fuzz across the screen, kind of like a ""no signal"" white noise fuzz you see on TV. Being completely creeped out I ran to open my wardrobe to look at myself in the mirror inside the door but it was the same thing - transparent with a rainbow fuzz. I then immediately ran towards my bathroom and splashed water on my face for about 2 minutes and when I looked up into the mirror above the sink everything was normal again. I was SO relieved but I was way too creeped out to stay in my dorm any longer so I quickly got dressed and got the fuck out of there. When I was on my way to the uni cafe to get some coffee to sort of ""ground"" myself I bumped into my friend A, from earlier, who also went to her dorm to take a nap. 

""cicixkitty I just had the creepiest dream."" A ran towards me.

When I asked her what happened she told me that she had a dream about two men, dressed in black suits and dark sunglasses, were walking around our uni campus looking for me, and she said that they were walking around the library. In her dream she made eye contact with them and she experienced a weird vibrational fuzz that made her head hurt, sort of similar to what I had. I then told her what just happened to me, and for shits and gigs we decided to go around the library ""looking"" for them, as an attempt to kind of calm ourselves down (hindsight, bad idea).

The moment the both of us walked inside the library, we got a headache and felt sick, and it was as if something was drawing us to get to the second floor in the silent independent study section. While we were walking up the stairs, both of us felt heavier and heavier like a force that was pushing us down. When we walked into the study room through the narrow shelves of books I got a mixture between a mild panic attack and deja vu. I felt like I was floating and my friend A said that she felt like there was someone behind one of the bookshelf aisles. We both ran out of there and outside the library to get away from whatever the hell was causing us this weird feeling. When we were sitting down on the square A suggested that the long bookshelf aisles triggered a memory of me subconsciously of those long narrow corridors you typically see in UFOs, and the moment she said that it was as if my body clicked and kept going ""YES YES!"". 

Nevertheless for the whole day it felt like we were being stalked by someone, and I absolutely swear to you at one point throughout the day we saw a pair of two men walking around the uni dressed in a suit, hat, and sunglasses, and they kept looking up, down, and over their shoulders as if looking for someone. We couldn't handle it anymore and we just spent the rest of the day in her dorm room, and because of how freaky everything was we kept staying over at each other's dorm rooms for the whole week to sleep next to each other because neither of us felt safe.

440,Alien abductees should all try carrying pregnancy tests in their pockets,Abductions,5,"The common consensus is that abductees are part of a breeding program and a common experience for women is having needles inserted into their bellies to test for pregnancy. This is incredibly horrifying. While I can't claim to know their ulterior motives, it seems like these beings are trying not to make the experience unnecessarily unpleasant. They tell people to calm down and attempt soothing mental telepathy, they don't engage in cruel acts that are unnecessary. Likely it would create even more memory suppression problems if they did. And they can communicate messages to us through telepathy. If someone could get through the paralysis and had a clear message and pregnancy test handy and was willing to demonstrate... maybe we could teach them something?"
441,Taken,Abductions,9,"I shared my stories with someone on reddit recently via private message and though since I had it all typed up I would go ahead and share with everyone else. Take it for what it is and I apologize for my bad grammar and typing. Once I got started it just came out as best I could describe. 

I'm a male, 34, and live in Texas north of Dallas. The two experiences below are before I got into my current relationship. I have a college education, no wife and not married but have a girlfriend (I haven't talked to her about these things she's not an opened minded type of person), no children, really not much going on... I work a full time job and that's about it...I'm quite boring really.

I can recall always having seen lights in the sky, ever since I was a young boy. As an adult I still see them quite often and regularly and have seen what I would presume to be air to ground teleportation lights (sort of like a beam of light from the sky to the ground but not a solid beam, like a tracer... Anyways, two abductions I can vividly recall that happened in the last 4 to 5 years, specifically them both near or around 2015. Lately only sightings in the sky and sometimes waking up feeling watched and not alone...

**1.** One night I was alone at home sleeping and woke up about 3am startled by something that moved my bed or me, couldn't tell, but it was a ""grey"", just one that I saw, standing next to my bed. This was absolutely terrifying at first for the first few seconds, then I had only curiosity towards it. I'm familiar with all types of things, conspiracies, aliens, etc.. so I was naturally more curious than afraid. This experience lasted no more than 45 seconds though. It wasn't really ""grey"" it was in a white suit (which I can see how people would get confused between grey and white, especially at night and in the dark. Any how, I asked one word aloud; ""why"" and I heard in my own head ""sleep"" as I looked into its large black lenses (there were lenses over the eyes as apart of the suit) and it actually forced me to fall back to sleep. This is what I like to call the ""blackout"". Now when I sleep I am usually always on my stomach and facing ""right"" with my arm almost hanging off the bed, so the next day when I ""woke back up""... I figured it had touched my arm or moved the bed and woke me up by accident. This little grey was no more than 3-4 inches from my face so I could make out its details clearly so I know what I saw. - That was it for this one. Quick and painless really. 

*This next story is a little different - so bare with me and try to visualize what I'm going to do my best to describe to you. - My experiences thus far have always happened from 1-3am-ish to the best of my knowledge and recollection whether they were just sightings or these two stories or waking up freaking out knowing I'm not alone in the room or house.* 

**2.** So, I'm already asleep (of course) they never come around when you're awake, which I find pretty shitty, especially since they never ""hurt"" me and I'm always wanting to ""talk"" to them... but enough of that...so I'm asleep, and then I just wake up. I wake up knowing I'm horizontal, like standing but I'm fixed to a surface I cannot see. I have practiced fighting the ""blackout"" or ""mind freeze"" however you want to best take that, so I'm awake, ""standing"" in this crescent shaped room where there is a grey at a console ""below"" me or out in front of me and to my left I see a opening (doorway/archway w/o a door) and I can see through that archway there is a corridor that wraps around from left to right but I can't see further than the right side of the archway. To the right of me (I'm looking straight ahead really) is pretty much just a wall with another archway or doorway in the back right corner that I can only see light coming from (just regular white light). And all the physical details of the surroundings are like a hazy blue-ish but dark metal, and the air is clear, I'm not covered in slime or strapped down but I feel constrained and can't move. Anyway, moving on.. I'm wide awake and kind of upset that I can't move so I start to writhe and wriggle and I really just end up falling down straight forward like a plank and I feel this...hard hit, it was an abrupt stop against the flooring as you could imagine...and right in my view is this grey at the console looking at me like ""you weren't supposed to do that"" and ""you're not supposed to be awake"" - Now I struggle to even move and I was kind of hurt from the fall, but I still remember my words ""I want to speak with you, I have questions""... that's all I could get out... I remember being ""stuck"" again on the damn floor. But I can give the details of the this grey.. he was not in a suit he was stark naked (at least from what I could tell since he was only visible from the stomach area up since he was behind a console), typicaly grey features except this guy was a little bit bigger than the previously mentioned one (the other one was only 3ft tall and much smaller in size. just tiny), he had a larger more bulbous head and his skin was more like that of a turtle and from what I could tell it was grey-ish but darker, with what I could see where something that resembled age spots, large eyes and nostrils like you would think or imagine and the mouth and jaw line where short but it was looking at me with it's mouth opened like ""wtf guy""... and I remember it saying - out loud - in words that were barely understandable - ""You'll have your chance boy"" - it was garbled, like words through water, then he used that stare and blacked me out again. The morning that followed I woke up with a bruised right knee and my right shoulder was hurting like I rammed somebody or tackled a wall. After that they haven't come to see me that I can remember or they've learned that I've learned that I can force myself awake and sort of come out of that unconscious state.

That's really it for the physical contacts I can remember. Other than the frequent night sightings of lights or seeing them pass by un-lit (which I have seen the red heat from the propulsion or anti gravity system (two to be exact - one red ring on either side under the shape/ship for one sighting in the last few months) and they just glide right over silently, unnoticed by anyone not looking up.

Now I know you might think - ""he's full of shit, this is made up"" - We'll I can tell you that I'm not and that I really don't care what other people think. I've mentioned this story to only a couple of people in my life and they mocked me and made fun, which I took it for what it was... most people don't believe in anything really, especially little grey men...or even God (I'm not a religious person but I do *believe* in many things). So judge me if you want but know that I have experienced something you haven't and I'm not afraid of the ridicule or jokes..."
442,Holes in my memory surrounding praying mantis hallucination,Abductions,11,Im not going to get all story time with this because im not trying to scare anyone i just want some feeling of recognition and familiarity. When i was 6 i hallucinated 2 praying mantis creatures that were easily 2 to 3 feet tall with red eyes making clicking sounds. Ive never hallucinated aside from this moment but i cant remember any follow up to seeing the creatures and i have entire days missing which i tried to address to my parents at the time but what i was left with were nightmares of alien abduction and the overwhelming fear to sleep with the light off and alone. I still sleep with my dog and the lights on. Does anyone have anything similar to this?
443,Validation?,Abductions,3,"Hi,

I've only posted one other post, but I've been reading lots of posts. When I was a kid, three to five years old, I had a crazy dream about aliens. I dreamt that I woke up in the middle of the night to a green light flashing into the hallway. I got out of bed, walked to the front of my parents room where I saw a spaceship landing inside of the front yard. It was not a disc saucer like most are perceived. Instead it looks like the men in black small upside down vial. Out pours 5 small aliens, typical gray aliens, but they look about the same size as me. I shake my mom to wake up, but she's not waking up, I shake my dad and he's not waking up. I am now screaming and crying as I'm holding onto them while I'm being ripped away from them. That's all I remember from that incident. Afterwards my brother said that both him and my father had taken me to the doctor shortly after I told them that dream, and that they saw a metallic thread sticking out of my knee. The doctor pulls it out and my father said it was about 2 feet long worth. It would not cut on scissors, the material was too strong, or something idk. I always thought it was a terrible dream, and my brother and dad were fucking with me. Then while I was working in Anaheim I would listen to spooky stories and random stuff on youtube. When all of a sudden a woman who had a brain tumor had the same experience. Green lights flashed from the front of her home, she shook her husband, but claimed he was in some sort of paralysis. This was a good explanation as to what happened to me when I was a kid. This happened to me over 20 years ago, and I still can picture it all perfectly but can't even remember the doctors visit after. Has this happened to anyone else? As far as abductions go, does this sound like what anyone else has ever gone through? I just want to know that I'm not crazy and if it was or was not a dream. I want to go through some kind of hypnosis to see if I can remember anything else, but am afraid that what if it fucks with me so bad I commit suicide or something. I have a family now and am too afraid of the possibility. Thank you for reading my whole post."
444,The Manhattan Alien Abduction,Abductions,0,0
445,"For cityboy, my alien invasion vivid dream",Abductions,12,"This is the incredibly vivid, unnatural dream I had recently which I recorded and hid in my dresser.  Whatever it was, it was no ordinary dream, and I didn't just dream it, I  felt it. I wrote it down that day.  I will record it as written.

My dream begins with  my efforts to keep a little pet octopus.  ""Mom"" says it's time for me to go stay with another family in Germany who run a church.  I go with my friend to stay at their house/church.  Things start to feel sinister when we go upstairs to talk to her sisters.  They insist on showing me a video about ""the rapture.""

Next thing we are not watching the movie but are part of it.  ""Ollie"" constantly escapes his tank and scratches us.

We go outside, our group. There's big crowds of wandering people in the fields.  We join in, walking behind these wanderers, watching.

Very suddenly spaceships appear in the sky, firing down yellow lights at all of us.  People everywhere fall down lifeless.  A Black man in front of me is hit and crumples to the ground instantly.  Everyone is being hunted or dying.  Are they dying or..something else?  Only the spaceships know.

Running now, a few of us, into the leafy woods.  I run down the banks into the creek and follow it.  Already we have outlasted many.  A girl my age catches up and falls in with me, trying to talk but we can't be too trusting of anyone.

Up ahead, coming towards us, floating several feet above the water: a ""bubble girl.""  A clear bubble floats in the air.  A perfect circle.  Inside, sitting upon nothing, the driver.  A teenage girl.  I feel her energy.  She is evil.  She is with the spaceships and will kill.  Still I am mesmirized by the floating bubble people.

Back to the church kitchen pantry area.  Our little group of survivors, from 6 years of age to the older ones like me.  Hiding and quick thinking is everything.  We keep watch through the windows and hit the ground when anyone comes near.  Are we hiding from death or things which are worse than death?  We help one another.  We try to feed ""Ollie.""

One day an adult woman enters the kitchen suddenly.  I don't make it out in time.  In an instant I've hid myself in the tight space behind the fridge.  She opens the fridge.  Next thing I know, she is layed on a platform outdoors by her own people, she's covered in sickening donut-shaped swellings.  A crowd of her own kind surrounds her, declares her dead.  A space craft hovers, carries her off.

Next close call-a teenage boy knocking on our door into the pantry.  Demanding that one of us is or was his girlfriend so we must let him in.  Of course we can't trust him.  In horror I wonder if one of our doors is actually locked.  Vertical or horizontal, I cannot remember which way is locked.  I frantically flip the lock this way and that.  

The boy has an evil energy.  I lay down on my belly, pushing the door with my feet, holding it there.  He pushes back hard.  Long, grey claws slipping slowly through the gap under the door.  I use my hands to raise my belly an inch off the floor.  He mustnt feel me.

Another group arrives to the property beside the church, a small field away.  These are the owners of the houses around us.  They approach our windows.  Again we cling to the floor.

The hiding is our only way.  The whole world is consumed by the sickness.  There are the hunters and the hunted.  This is what it means to undergo the *liquidation*. I didn't believe in the spaceships- the aliens- not till I saw them.  I'd believed in the church.  Was the church just one of the schemes of the liquidators all along- they've hid their existence.

I wonder what the sickness is.  I wonder who the aliens are and what they want.  I wonder if the dead are really dead- or worse.  What happens when they're lifted up onto the craft?  But we have no answers.  We survive by the second.  Is this ""survival?"""
446,Possible abduction? Want feedback,Abductions,5,"Just today, I was just sitting around, when it felt like memories came to me that before now, I didn't know about. Shortly after, I got a weird feeling in my head. Not a headache, but like my brain was stressing and shutting down. After I focused on something else, the feeling was gone, and I couldn't remember the memories anymore. I remembered remembering them, but I didn't know their contents. As I am writing this, the feeling is back, and I am trying to focus on the memories and write them down. One involves what I think is a younger me being dragged through a hallway. I was putting up a fight before I was beaten repeatedly by some odd figure. I can't quite describe how it, I think it was a he, looked. It had a bipedal form, but it was definitely not human. I'd say he was about 5 feet high, so not a giant, and the skin was a red-purple color. The face looked human in shape, but that is where the facial resemblance ended. It had what appeared to be two oval shaped eyes, but the patterns and colors resembled a goat eye. His mouth looked human until it opened. The teeth appeared almost like the pointy parts of a spider's mandibles, but more, ""tooth shaped."" Like a human tooth. That is all I remember as of now, but I will come back to edit more as time goes on if I remember anything.

Now, I do know I have some mutations and some possible mutations. I have two genes for celiac, I have one gene for hemachromatosis (dormant thank god, I hate needles) and some others that are slipping my mind. I have weird colored eyes, it is like they can't decide if they are green or brown. At first glance they look brown, but if you look closer they seem more green. I have checked under different lighting and the result is always the same. I have bad skin shedding issues on my feet, which nothing has ever helped. No foot fungus cream, nothing. I process potassium differently than other people, I get much more from foods than other people, but my body has a slight difficulty getting protein.

This morning, I woke up with multiple bruises. This has happened throughout my life, waking up with random bruises. I know it isn't my parents, they are extremely kind people, and I know it isn't sports related, because I rarely leave the house unless I have to, so it is slightly confusing. Pre-puberty I also went through a massive personality change. Up until I was 6 I was a normal kind human. Still am kind, but I tend to think about things, specifically humans and relationships with them, in a more cold and calculated way. I view people based off of their skills and how long they can be useful to me rather than how nice somebody is, or other ways. I do still feel empathy towards others, so I don't think it is quite sociopathy or psychopathy, but who knows.

Anyways, this is all the information I can recall that may help. Please give some feedback, I am legitimately scared and slightly curious."
447,Discord,Abductions,0,"I am working on a Discord server, so that real-time discussions may occur. I believe it might help some people.

448,"gonna start recording my ""ayy"" ""dreams"" on here from now on",Abductions,11,"i have had these weird alien related ""dreams"" throughout my life. i know for a fact i dont remember every single encounter, but there are a few i remember with varying levels of recollections. for now i will describe the latest ""dream"". i put the word dream in quotes because they were extremely vivid as compared to my normal dreams, and very surreal. i dont know how else to describe it

the latest 1 that i posted in the dreams chat in the creepfire discord:

""i was in some type of summer camp or boot camp or whatever at this school or base? it was all young adults like me (im turning 25 soon) with a few dudes i know from my old jobs. i remember 2 or 3 specific parts of this dream. the 1st we were in this big empty room (gymnasium?) where we all had to stand against the walls facing towards the room and move around random 3d shape objects with our minds. telekinesis i think its called. we had to move around pyramids, spheres and cubes around the middle space and everything was pretty much just flying around. 2nd part i remember we all went outside to some open grass field and were trying to build a mini bridge or castle with gray bricks minecraft style. we were moving the gray bricks around with our minds. i dont remember exactly what i did but i screwed something up like put the wrong brick or object in the wrong place. i felt great shame from doing this so i just walked away.
3rd part i remember was some old fat guy, some santa claus looking motherfucker in normal clothes (?) was telling me to put my index finger into this white socket for me to upload all my memory into this computer. i dont remember if it was my left or right index finger. i was a bit hesitant but i did it anyway. on this tablet-like screen held up to head level with some gray metal bars, like a small computer monitor, there were random images being flashed on the screen. like 5 or 6 images a second. just completely random stuff. i do remember that 1 of the images was a colored drawing of an anime girl. like those pictures people used to use as computer wallpapers or whatever. the rest of the images were just miscellaneous crap like a rusted out car, a frog, a waterfall, an explosion, a school bus, etc. just completely random shit. i woke up the next day around noon, even though i went to bed 11 hours earlier at 1 am. i felt disoriented and scared to go back to sleep because of how disturbing the dream was""

i have others from years before that i remember to varying degrees. involving classic ayys, a hybrid/""hubrid"" waifu to those who are in the know with abduction lingo (hubrid = hybrid that seems 100% human), and hubrids living here with us. i understand the skepticism of a lot of people who will read this, especially with much of /x/ accusing me of LARPing, but i can tell you right now im not posting this for any other reason besides support from other people who experienced this shit, whatever it is. i will post various other memories and ""dreams"" for those who are interested"
449,I think something happened last night,Abductions,21,"Actually the early hours of the morning.  I felt the unmistakable presence of the beings all around me.  I was paralysed and trying to get out of it.  The only thing I could move was my tongue.  I was sticking my tongue out and chomping my teeth to show that I was awake and not dead.  I was convinced I'd be mistaken for dead.

I felt a man's hands on the back of my head.  Not a human man.  By this time I was overwhelmed with fear and trying to scream.  

I felt a slice across the back of my head with something like a scalpel.  It felt like a 2 inch slice across.  Then fluid gushing out from the cut.  I don't remember pain just tremendous fear and a warm-ish fluid coming down the back of my head.  Then there was a second slice underneath the first, exactly the same manner and then the fluid pouring out from it.  After that my whole body started shaking uncontrollably for awhile.  

I know a lot of people will think it's only sleep paralysis, look I don't claim to know exactly what it is, I don't think it's just sleep paralysis, the intensity of it, the consistency of the events (seeing/sensing the same beings repeatedly, the unmistakable and distinct aura of the beings, medical procedures recurring on the same places on my body: back of head, belly, foot).  Whatever it was was absolutely terrifying and I never want to go through that again.

Today when I woke up did I find the fluid from my head on my pillow or feel scars across the back of my head or pain there?  No I did not.  The one unusual thing was a quick flash of red-orange light when I blinked my eyes this morning.  Like I have repeatedly said, I think what the beings are doing is operating on the real us (our conciousness) and not always on our physical bodies.

I know it could be a myriad of different things.  Personally I think the beings did something to me this morning.  I just want to report it.  I want to have it documented and have somebody besides me know about it.

450,roll me under,Abductions,1,"MEADOW isn't the only song on the new Stone Temple Pilots album about Scott Weiland (WEILAND is the Dutch word for pasture, grassland, & meadow)... You're gonna trip da f*ck out (I think...lol)... (This is my interpretation of ROLL ME UNDER, but I always encourage other people to think independently of my opinions...) I'm just offering my insight, and also some reasons why I think as I do... :)

Here are the song lyrics to ROLL ME UNDER:



Do you believe in something beautiful
Between chaos and the light

(communicating telepathically with the deceased - psychic mediumship)
(light = heaven, love, laughter / chaos = physical reality, human existence / between = psychic awareness and communication between this reality and the next)


You gave it all for something you once sold
The truth be told you lied

(the idea that it is necessary to commit to a life of hard core drug addiction to make really good music)
(many musicians are drug free and grew out of drug use, and still make really good music - like Jeff Gutt)


If it's the taste you remember
You may not share in this sweet delight

(this is a wisecrack... Scott remembers the joy of being a rock star, but someone else has now taken over for him because he can't do it anymore)


Yeah we can live forever
If there's a time we can get it right

(a reference to spirituality and/or writing music)


Roll me under, I'll pull the trigger for ya
Do with me what you will

(ROLL ME UNDER - think of things in terms of energy and vibration... we all come from a source of immortality, unconditional love, and constant humor... when we go to the lower emotions that are fear and survival-based, it feels like movement into a lower plane of existence... we are UNDER the higher emotions of love and light)
(movement of energy / vibration = rolling)
(he's pulling the trigger for Scott Weiland now... of yeah... and Scott is STILL overseeing everything)
(Jeff is serving a higher purpose for the spiritual plane - ""do with me what you will"")


Hold me under, the water running over
Do with me what you will

(we are holding ourselves down emotionally from ""up above"" in the human experience - but all of us can grow out of it and show less fear and more love)
(the water running over: spiritual beings looking down on us from the non-physical perspective - lighter energy - lighter thoughts - lighter emotions)

Are you receiving nothing once again
Is there shame for what's been done
It screams so loud that you can't begin
'Cause you're always on the run

(shame for what's been done - living life as a drug addict)
(always on the run - Scott is a free spirit now)

* Here are the reasons why I think this song is about psychic mediumship... Go read the lyrics to Alice in Chains VOICES, 311 LARGE IN THE MARGIN, Pearl Jam EVEN FLOW, Nirvana LITHIUM, & Tool JIMMY. There are plenty of highly aware human beings on the planet!"
451,Picture of my possible implant,Abductions,14,"Let me start by saying one of my earliest memories is of a spotlight on a beach. Then I have memories of seeing and speaking to glowing red orbs in times of distress. My mother abused drugs and would tell me that when I was born she heard a voice say that she needed to be patient with me because I wasn't from here. Always told me that when I felt weird. As an adult I chalked it up to her addictions.

As a teen I had what was either unchecked psychological episodes or contact with a non physical entity. But called itself Az, and claimed angelic origins. It told me I was important to the survival of our species, etcetcetc. As an adult I've written this all off as stress induced psychosis as my teen years were unconventional at best.

But... I've seen things as a grown up. Orange silent orbs. Big black silent triangles.... And this past year I found the marks.

They're three dots in a triangle on my hand. They don't hurt. They don't itch and they're a damn near perfect triangle. I don't want to rule out the possibility that they're burns or warts but they really don't seem that way.

Honestly I could go on and on about it. If people are interested I will. But for now here's a picture of the marks.

http://imgur.com/D7u9pB6

I'd be interested in having it tested and would be willing to do hypnosis I'm just too poor for it. I have other pictures of the marks too.

Do you have something similar? I'd love to hear from people.

Edit: I'm going to expand on my experiences a bit and post my other photos.  Thanks for being helpful,  my post in thetruthishere was abysmal.  Don't know what I was expecting. Anyway.

http://imgur.com/NB3oa57
http://imgur.com/sWkxaWH

Those are two other pics that show the marks better.. 

Heres what I've seen:
Like I said my earliest clear memory is of a searchlight. I lived in a house by the beach and couldn't have been older than 3.  My memory begins with me at a huge picture window overlooking the ocean in the middle of the night.  There's a white beam sweeping the beach but there's no memory of it coming from anything. I also remember no noise. What I do remember is my mom coming to me and telling me that it was just a helicopter looking for someone,  which I can buy.

Next were the red orbs. I have two memories of them.  My mother left me at the movies once and when it finished I was waiting for her in the parking lot.  Probably around 6 years old.  It was late and I was alone and scared. I remember looking up and seeing three red orbs floating in the sky and heard a voice in my mind that told me not to worry.  That I'd always be looked after. I saw them again at my window one night but can't recall anything more. 

Fast forward. I'm 19, going to school (but not class,  like a dumbass....  Anyway...)  in Arizona.  I was at a house party outside Prescott. It was about 3 am to my memory and my experiences and I were alone on a porch. In the sky we saw two lights,  like headlights,  heading toward us.  When it came overhead it was a triangle and it made no noise. Can't remember much after that TBH,  but I asked her about it recently and she confirms it and still wonders. 

Then a few years ago I was in Wisconsin.  My dads family lives out there and I was staying with them for a week while he was in the hospital. Almost every night I saw orange orbs, sometimes 4 or 5 at a time, that looked like stars but would drift horizontally before stopping on a dime and going the other direction.  I could watch them do this for hours at a time and my cousins said they were a very regular thing.  Once one came over their house. They said it was too bright to discern a shape and silent. 

That's what I've seen. 

What I've heard I'd hard to recall.  I was 15 when it started.  I'd begun writing poetry late at night. I remember feeling like I wasn't the one doing the writing. What I can't remember is how I met Az. He was a voice in my mind that gave me guidance and encouragement, who told me that I was an important figure elsewhere and vital to humanity's survival.  He told me my words would bring together a group of people who could expose those who sought our enslavement from the shadows.  Heady stuff and TBH I can only recall generalizations because I convinced myself it was all in my mind after awhile.  I remember him saying the tides would rise.  I remember him talking about things not from here that feed on our suffering. But not much more as far as specifics go. I'm sorry. One day my ex,  who knew about him and had her own equivalent named Lain,  convinced me he was fake becUse of some inconsistency that  I can't recall and I haven't heard from him since. 

There was a brief period a few years ago I tried channeling him but have since lost the writing. 

I wish there was more to tell but that's what I've got.  I hope I find some people who have been thru similar things so we can try to make sense of the inexplicable. Thanks for reading."
452,Nervous to say this.. (My Experience),Abductions,19,"I will receive heavy judgement for posting this.. only my SO knows and believes me. I've been searching for a platform to tell my story and I think this subreddit is the most open minded place I've found on the internet. I won't say everything but if anyone wants the intimate details: PM me.

I'll put it in a timeline:

- age 13 - dreams of a man who started telling me 'secrets' about the world and where humanity came from. He said I would have to take over from him and tell the world these things.

- age 14-16 - dreams of weird specie (kind of human like) and implantation of their DNA into me over the course of 8 sessions. Pain was experienced in real life and documented scars (I have pics).

- age 17 - 18 - started seeing the man and I wrote down everything he told me (thinking of publishing this).

- age 19 - began growing distant from humans and I started 'feeling' extraordinary and different. 

- age 20 - 21 - revelation from one of them that I am a hybrid and experiment.

- February 20th 2018 - physical/somatic encounter. "
453,My abduction experience. (Abductee feedback please!),Abductions,12,"Edit: I posted this the other day but then I got a message saying it was removed because my account is new and it may be spam, but I promise this definitely is not spam. 

OK, so. Before I get into this I just want to say some things. First of all, I'm currently typing this out on an iPhone, so please forgive any atrocious autocorrect misspellings. 

I'm 28 years old. Male. I live right outside chicago, over the border in NW indiana. I'm currently pursuing a BAS at Purdue. I'm not exactly what you would call scientifically illiterate, and I consider myself fairly mentally sound. I've never had any problems on that front. 
I have only ever openly discussed this once before, on a random quora question that caught my eye - also anonymously. So I'm still not very good at discussing it openly, and only 2 people who know me know what happened to me, I had avoided talking about it for a long time, fearing the stigma associated with the topic.  Especially in the professional and scientific communities. I was immensely relieved when the people I did open up to about it believed me unquestioningly. And the result of that is me typing this here today. Go easy on me, please. 

That all being said, I've been trying for a few years to come to terms with something that happened to me. It was almost 5 years ago to the day. Shortly after my 23rd birthday. 
My father is very sick, so I was staying with my parents at the time to help take care of him and the house.

I awoke in the middle of the night. It was warm, but I could hear and feel the breeze from the fans I need on to go to sleep. I reached over and grabbed my phone, checked the time. It was 3:31am. I put the phone back down and tried to get settled back into a comfortable position. However after a moment I realized I could hear and feel a humming. I knew right away it wasn't from my fans, it was very deep, and I could actually feel it in my body. Our house is by some train tracks, so at first I thought it may just be a train, but I quickly realized that wasn't it either.  
While I was laying in bed wondering what it was, I noticed for the first time that my door was open -My door is never open during the night. Hell, even during the day. Never. Ever. - and I could see a light shining down the hallway and into my room.  At first I thought maybe my dad was going to the bathroom and had his flashlight out, but then I realized the light was... Wrong. It wasn't the right color. As I watched, it started to get brighter. Until it looked like someone had set up a white/blue LED array at the end of the hall in the kitchen. As the light got brighter so did the humming. I tried to jump up to go investigate, fearing an intruder, when I realized I couldn't move. 
Well, let me clarify. I could move my hands, my neck, my feet, but it felt like someone had placed straps over my limbs and torso.  After a brief moment of transcendent terror and confusion, I thought to myself ""okay, maybe this is sleep paralysis"". I've of course read about it before, but never experienced anything like this. Right after that thought I realized I could no longer feel the bed under me. I started rising in the air, and gently... floating,for lack of a better word, to my doorway- and the light. 

I know how this sounds but I'm 110% serious, please just stay with me. 
As I levitated through the doorway and into the hall, I had a clear view into my parents room. Their door is right next to mine on the left hand side of the hall when walking out of my room. If you take a step out, turn 90 degrees and take another step, you're in their room. Anyway, I could see them laying on the bed, I started screaming. Begging for help. They didn't move. In fact I couldn't even see them breathing, and at that moment I was convinced they were dead, and I was about to be next. This moment of pure unadulterated panic caused something to... Snap. In the blink of an eye I found I could move my arms again, and I flailed impotently in the air. I eventually got my hands on the door frame and clung on for dear life. I gripped that frame like my life depended on it, because in that moment I wholeheartedly believed that it did. 
To my dismay I realized that my fingers were slowly starting to slip, as I continued to be pulled inexorably down the hall toward the kitchen, and I dug my nails in as hard as I could to try and stop it. And in a quick burst of pain and terror I lost my grip, and continued to... Float (typing this part makes me feel ridiculous, I know how it sounds).
A few more seconds of terrifying levitation and I was in the kitchen. Floating with the top of my head facing our back door. It's a large sliding glass door, and I could see that this is where the light was shining in from. Something that felt about as bright as the sun was hovering right above our pool. We have a large in ground pool almost smack dab in the middle of the back yard, which is entirely fenced in with a 10 foot privacy fence. Whatever this was had to be directly over the water, maybe a couple of feet off the ground.  I took all of this in within a heartbeat, and was still in a state of terror I will never be able to adequately explain, when I felt the breeze. My back door was wide open. But for the life of me I can't tell you if it had been open all along or if it had just been opened in front of me. 
At that moment I slowly began to settle back down on to the floor. I felt the cold floor on my back as my shirt had lifted slightly. Right as I touched the ground. I saw them. If I thought I had been afraid before, it was nothing compared to this moment right here. One stepped in and took a step to stand over me at my left side. It looked down at me, and even from my perspective on the floor I could tell this thing was fucking tall. If I had to guess, I would say 7ft 10 - 8ft at the very least. We have 9 foot ceilings in the kitchen and its head was shockingly close to the ceiling. The light was so painfully bright at this point that I didn't get to take in a whole lot of detail, as it was kind of shadowed by the light behind us. Two more stepped in and took a place to either side of my shoulders. Standing by the door, almost like guards would. Keep in mind this has all happened fairly quickly, and in this moment I begin to have an idea of what this is. The terror is unspeakable. I remember thinking they don't look anything like how they're often portrayed in movies. They were skeletal, and their skin looked like it was... Well, I have no idea, but it didn't really look like our skin. It was just strange. The one standing to the left of me had something in its hand. As I turned my neck to get a better view, I could take in a little more of its form. It's fingers. Christ, I can't even describe what seeing those fingers did to me. They were almost spider like. Way too long and way too many joints. To this day that's probably the one image that sticks out the most. It clutching this black(maybe gunmetal or a darker silver, hard to tell because it was smooth like glass and the light was obscuring a lot.) it reminded me almost of an iPhone without any power. But it was thinner, shaped almost like a remote or a very short rod with a square-ish shape with rounded edges. Just a smooth glass like... Thing.   It's fingers moved over it and every single muscle in my body tensed up. The air shot into my lungs as the expanded all the way, and every single limb shot straight out. It was like I was a plank of wood. My jaw was clenched so tight I thought my teeth would shatter. I lost all control. The only thing I could move at this point were my eyes, and even then, very little. It was like the signals from my nervous system were completely disrupted, and another foreign signal was imposed in their place. The two standing behind me (above? I'm still laying flat on my back.) shuffle forward a bit, and I start to rise back up again. I feel fingers on my shoulders and I begin to hover out the door. And the second I get out the door the light is so overwhelmingly powerful and then... Nothing.

I wake up in my bed. It's 5:45am. I'm sweating bullets. My stomach hurts. I get up, and start going about my morning routine. I try to shrug off the experience as a dream. And it works. 
When I'm about to get into the shower I notice a sharp pain. I look in the mirror. I have bruises EVERY WHERE. Arms, ankles, thighs, but the worst of them are on my shoulders and back. Very very clearly were what looked like hand prints. Albeit elongated ones. I throw up almost instantly. I try to pull myself together and head back to my room. I see my door frame. I see the scratches. I see they line up with my fingers. I see the wood and blood under my finger nails. 

I have never entirely come to terms with any of it.  My fiancée has encouraged me to share, but it still feels deeply uncomfortable and jarring to just walk through it. As I've typed this, my hands have dropped to what feels like sub zero temperatures and my whole body is shaking. I'm sure if I asked my fiancée she would tell me I'm also extremely pale. Even more than usual.  This is what happens every time I think about it. 
After many nights spent doing research, watch youtube videos of ufologists conferences, reading people's reports, the same thing always happens. Physiological response every time.  
And after a lot of reading, and watching, I realized I had another experience when I was 5 years old. 
It's my clearest childhood memory. And my earliest. Most of my childhood is hazy. I have snapshots. But this one memory I have is exponentially clearer than anything else. Although I've until relatively recently shrugged it off as just a quirk of being young. But I was never the imaginative child that claims to see what they imagine. I always had an extremely firm grasp of reality vs imagination, which is why this earlier episode stands out. It went something like this : 

I'm 5, it's Easter morning, I wake up super excited to go see my Easter basket. My mom always went way overboard and it was essentially Christmas in spring. Only child ftw. Anyway, I jump up and sneak out of my room. It's just before dawn. Still dark out, but light is starting to refract around the horizon, making everything that dark twilight. I sneak down the hallway, well aware my parents are still asleep, and hoping they'll wake up soon so I can go tear into a massive basket of toys and candy. As I get to the end of the hallway and peak into the living room, I see it. At first I think my parents are up, but as I get a clear look at it. This part is slightly fuzzy. I remember it was big. Tall. Grey. And something about its skin made me think of short fur, so naturally I thought it was the Easter bunny (or my dad dressed up as the Easter bunny) the things actual form eludes me, just that it was tall and Grey. The weird thing is, when I picture it in my head, everything else in the scene is cristal clear. Everything. Except that. I can see it in my head and it's like someone put a blur filter over this things shape. Like what they do for people's faces on Cops. Maybe that's where I got the impression of fur, or maybe it really was blurry in real life, like active camouflage, or it was done after the fact- Assuming it is what I now believe it to be. As I said, this experience cannot be substantiated by physical evidence, so I always just shrugged it off until recently.  
But something about that memory would often pop into my thoughts. Like when I go to the dentist, and everything is great until they lay me down and the light is in my eyes and the drills and sucking tubes start going, and this primal terror sets in. Since the primary encounter THAT is what usually starts flashing in my head, and the Easter bunny experience is much less frequent these days, but it still happens all the same. 

All these tiny and not so tiny things that I never really thought about before seem to make a scary kind of sense in light of the experience I wrote about first. I don't know for sure what happened to me. Im not going to say that I do. 
All I know is that it wasn't a dream. It wasn't sleep paralysis. I've never sleep walked. There was physical evidence of something happening. I rage at myself for trying to suppress it and not documenting absolutely everything, although the scratches are very much so still visible on the door frame at my parent's house. 
I can tell you all the things I know for a fact it was not. And after eliminating those as possibilities... Well, Im assuming you know how that saying goes. 

I apologize profusely for any spelling or grammatical mistakes, as I said above, Im on an iPhone and at this point my hands are shaking like I'm in a freezer. If anyone has questions I would be more than happy to try to answer them, but what I really would like is to hear from people who have had similar experiences.  How it compares to mine, what's the same, what's different. All that. 
As I was looking for any sort of guidance or help I contact mufon and they ended up doing a phone interview for like 2-3 hours, and gave me the name of a hypnotherapist in chicago that could take me through it. But the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. They kept trying to spin it as positive. Trying to say they were benevolent. And I can conclusively say there was absolutely nothing benevolent about them. At all. Maybe not necessarily malevolent, but utterly unconcerned with the state of my wellbeing for sure. I looked into ones eyes. Most of its face was shadowed, but I could see it's eyes. There was nothing kind or benevolent there. I am positive that in that moment I was a thing, not a sentient being, as far as it was concerned. It didn't necessarily feel robotic, more like aloof. I don't know, I could be mistaken. But what I'm not mistaken of is that it was no way shape or form a positive experience. 

Since then, I've been diagnosed with severe abnormal hormonal imbalances. I already had nerve damage and an implanted neurostimulator in my spine, so I've had a lot of scans done. It was put in when I was 16 after an electrocution injury. Fried most of the nerves in my left leg. Anyway, they've looked at my brain a ton. But now I can't have an MRI because of my spinal implant, but a CT revealed an abnormal mass in my brain that was no there on previous scans. They say it's benign but they can't quite see it in enough resolution to make a definite diagnosis as to what it is. I also have a strange black thing under the skin of my left left. Kneecap. Which happens to be right where the nerve damage in that leg is. Dead in the middle of it. It looks like a piece of lead or something under the skin. Tried to have it cut out once but the doctor couldn't get it. Said it wasn't bothering me and wasn't causing problems. So I should leave it. Aside from the nerve damage evrery thing else happened soon after the experience. I have another strange side effect but I'm not 100% sure if it's a result of the neurostimulator changing my bodies EM field or something.... Else. But I blow out light bulbs. I can document it. I've had friends, family, professors at school, strangers, etc witness it. It happens with such reliability that based on my proximity and type of bulb I can almost tell when it's going to happen. Lamp used to be next to my bed. Lights kept burning out of exploding. Tried different sockets. Broke out the multimeter, tested everything. All normal.  Same result. Moving them away from me fixed the problem. I've even had some of the professors in the engineering department take an interest in helping me figure out exactly what's causing it.  I think he thought I was bullshiting him until he saw it happen repeatedly. Walking down a hallway with a low ceiling. 4 fluorescent bulbs burn out just as I walk past them one after the other. It happens all the time, but it's more of an interesting quirk than an actual problem.  
If we nail down a cause I'll definitely post what it is. 

I'm sure I left some stuff out and I've rambled on quite a bit, really sorry about that, it's the anxiety. "
454,What do you think they want from us?,Abductions,12,"As far back as I can remember, I have always just “known” that aliens aren’t trying to hurt us. We’re solely bodies that they use for experimenting so they understand our kind. 
Surely if they wanted to kill us all, we’d be gone, right? They’re probably more advanced in many ways. 
I’m curious what everyone else thinks is going on when someone is abducted? "
455,"Wasn't abducted, but has anyone else seen this ...thing.. as well??",Abductions,7,"Sorry for the shit title, my friend and myself saw this entity... alien... I dont even know, we have both searched online for other sightings and found nothing. This turned out to be longer then I had planned on writing about it, just fyi. 

So about 10 \- 11 years ago me and my friend were walking around at night in our small coastal town and there was a walking path that led down to a netball court, oval and a rec hall. A girl in our year from highschool lived in a house right next to the path that takes you from the residential streets down to the netball court etc. You can see into her kitchen window from behind her house. There is nothing, but grass and darkness behind her house as its just grass until you reach the oval and shit. We are making our way down to the oval, we are just past the front of her house and about to be behind it when we both notice this thing standing behind her back fence and looking up into her kitchen window \(from a distance as the window isnt just right there.. you get me? Its a two story house, kitchen upstairs\).   
Now it's dark as fuck, street lights aren't lighting this area, but the moon is directly behind whatever this is and that's how i see it's features. It was very slender, muscular and resembled a fly's mouth and eyes. The body looked sort of human, but it seemed like it was just pure lean muscle. It had hair or some sort of shit, it looked like a Mohawk.  
Some reason we didn't stop walking when we saw it and now we are standing face to face \(about 3 meters distance between us\) and I can't see shit cause the moon isn't catching anything. I had my flip phone out and was trying to see it more clearly \(fail..cause i'm using a flip phone\), honestly my mind was just in ""wtf"" mode and I couldn't process anything else. It couched down, and I could see it was coming towards us, but I couldn't make out a head, face or a body, it just seemed like a blurry brownish mass coming straight at me. At this point my friend started walking backwards and telling me to run, but it was like i was just frozen in a state of confusion. I'm standing next to a tree, next minute I hear 2\-4 loud thumping sounds from what I imagine is coming from it's foot and then something jumped into the tree right next to me, all the leaves rustle and shit, my friend is freaking the fuck out, then we hear really loudly wings taking off and it's jumped out of the tree and must of fucking flew off, that's when we both run for our lives. We kept looking behind us, but I don't think it followed, and if so, we didn't see it. We both have never seen it again. I'm not sure what I seen, I haven't been able to find anyone that has seen the same thing. All I know is that it's body was lean, very muscular, it had a fly like mouth, eyes, hair like a Mohawk and we had caught it looking into the girls kitchen window from behind her back fence. I've googled the moth man and watched some stuff on it, but the description I read or the video gives doesn't feel like what I saw, but the fact that I knew it flew off and we heard swooping of the wings as it took off makes me believe it could fly, although I never saw wings on it when I had seen it's face and body. This happened in Australia, NSW on the South Coast in a small town that is surrounded by beaches. "
456,Fighting back?,Abductions,6,"lets say, hypothetically that I was regularly visited and/or abducted and experienced what one would call invasive or even sadistic experimentation. would trying to fight back even be worth the effort? or am I better off just suffering through it and trying to live a normal life? are such violent visits common? why would any one particular person be selected & objected to this? Why me?        "
457,Just a general question,Abductions,9,"Hi all,

I apologize if anyone has answered this before. But, I was randomly thinking this morning. How does alien abduction work exactly? Like, what I mean is when they bring you to a ship and you're inside, do you go through the ceiling or window? Wouldn't someone in the house wake up at the sound of a broken window?

I'm not a skeptic, I'm actually open. I just randomly thought of the question this morning and was wondering if anyone has explained it before."

459,Describing the Tall Man,Abductions,6,"The Tall Man is a very frequently recurring figure in my abduction/interdemensional events.  Here I will describe the entity's appearance and behavior.  I believe this entity does exist and based on many encounters with it.

The Tall Man is an abomination.  It may be the same man seen over and over again in many different situations or it may be many different nen who all look and act alike.  

Appearance: almost exactly like the descriptions of the Men in Black and the Slenderman.  Tall and exceptionally skinny.  About 9 feet or more tall.  Pale white skin.  Wears a black suit.  Very clean and slow moving.  Raspy voice. Odd manner of speech with word repetition or sing-song words.  Threatening.  Lacks energy- usually sitting in a chair or standing still.  I often had experiences where I called him ""the Leader"" because it seemed the other entities were worshipping him with people also crawling on the ground to bring him pieces of paper.

Once I had an interdemensional event where I was seeing a group of men looking like this and called them ""the Elders"".  There were about 6 of them in the event.  All of them pedophiles.  This I knew through telepathy.  They are pedophiles.  

Personality and behavior: Sadism.  Ablity to brainwash.  Dislikes motion and activity.  Likes pedophilia and rape.  The being or beings rapes with it's fingers.  Performing surgical experiments and mutilations upon victims.  Deception.  Obsessive in stalking.  Controlling.  Hides. Hunts victims.  Preference for children and females as victims.  Can contact victims with just voice without actually appearing.  I believe the entity can ""possess"" victims in a way like indwelling them in a parasitic sort of way.

I believe the Tall Man is the being I once heard saying ""I'm going to kill you kill you"".  This is probably because I am aware of him and have been victimized by him as well as seen him victimizing others.  

The entity I am describing is very similar to what people describe from encounters with the *Men in Black*

I had something of a strong warning dream once, i don't think this was necessarily an abduction thing but more of a  dream warning, in which I saw myself and a young Asian girl running around the side of a highway.
2 of these Tall Men in a classic white Lincoln we're driving the road luring kids into their car.  While we were screaming out ""*you'll never come back, you'll die, they'll kill you if you go with them*."" But kids were still getting in the car.    "
460,"Pennsylvania Aliens and ""dream"" worlds",Abductions,0,"while UFO and alien sightings were happening in Pennsylvania my dad was a kid and as a kid he told his mom about seeing little fuzzy men in his window and had on going dreams about a place called Tigerlily. I've been trying to find anything i can about this place and if anyone else has had similar experiences but i haven't been able to find anything, I'll trt getting more details of the world and add them in when i can, but if any of you have heard or Tigerlily or seen the Little fuzzy men it would be amazing to hear your experience so i can see how  much of it is related. "
461,Terrifying noise,Abductions,8,"I won't get into this too much because I don't feel too comfortable writing about this, but I had a dream where I was abducted and there was one thing that petrified me. It was this unbearable noise on the space ship. Very, very loud. It kind of sounded like those electricity boxes where you can kind of hear the humming, but so much louder. So loud to the point where I had to put hands over my ears and even then it didn't make it any quieter. Like a mix of a swarm of bees and electricity all combined. Does anyone else have a similar experience? The aliens also gave me some clues and words but like I said I wanted to talk about the noise and keep the rest to myself.
I was hoping somebody could relate. Thank you for reading

The door opens and there's a tall lanky silhouette standing there. 

I wake up in my bed on my stomach, I never sleep on my stomach, it's painful. There's a really loud thought in my head telling me not to look, if I don't look at them, they won't know. 

I'm so lost. What the Fuck happened. Had anybody had anything similar to that? "
464,Any similar cases?,Abductions,18,"Hey guys I'm new to this thread. I had an encounter about 3 months ago with another kind. I'm unsure if it was a full abduction as the room was the same as my bedroom except some things had changed (ie. The curtains were now open and there was a blinding light coming through my window). The beings I encountered were not the typical Alien ""Grey's"", these were more biologically proportioned to that of a human being. However, they were translucent. Much like a shadow but more grey in tone (I do have knowledge of the ""shadow people"" but the light is what makes me think they were more likely extraterrestrial). These beings were also not entirely bound to our laws of physics as they passed through my bed without any kind of resistance. In total there were 5 entities, the tallest of which was around 7ft tall and the shortest (who I perceived to be the leader) was only 4-5ft tall. This leader then proceeded to reach outbid arm as if you touch my face and I blacked out (maybe some kind of psychic power?). 
After this encounter I had a migraine that persisted for a number of days. 
Was hoping someone on here could shed some more light on these beings. Perhaps some of you have met the translucent beings yourself. And maybe you can tell me what they wanted with me?

Thanks,
D"
465,Odd Childhood Dream Memories,Abductions,3,"Putting this out there, in case it sounds familiar to anyone else; some fragments/associations from a dream, in the order they happened, that have stayed with me for years since early childhood (age 4 or 5)- maybe nothing at all, but in case not:

-""Skeletons"" coming (as in a gliding motion) through the walls, while ""chattering their teeth""/ high-frequency clicking sounds

-Sitting in a aqua-colored bowl-like area, almost like a huge circular swimming pool emptied of water; above is utter black, vague other ""skeletons"" also sitting (in a circle inside the ""bowl"", no seats, just facing in with knees bent, hunching forward a little). I hear a constant noise that sounds like [tires on a steel grate bridge](https://youtu.be/-_thhcuwEyY?t=73), and there is a smell like PVC (think brand-new shower curtains, beach ball inflation nozzles, etc.)

-Being with other children my age, all of us given a sort of object-puzzle to solve as a test; surroundings/light very dim, ""brown"" and non-defined. I solve the object-puzzle first, and try to show the other kids how, but I ""hear"" in my head the idea that my intelligence is good, but am too disruptive/""aware"", I should not be aware of/interfering with the other kids. I have a split-second picture of the ""boss/teacher"" (emotionless but STERN somehow), very tall, behind some podium-thing, wearing a dark gown/cape, her head/face like a praying mantis more than anything else. 

This is the only dream that's ever stayed with me to this degree of forcefulness of memory and detail, for this length of time; I'm in my mid-40's now, and I'm using my adult vocabulary as best I can to describe the dream that's stayed with me all this time. If any of this rings a bell, feel free to comment (or PM if you'd like to keep discussion ""off the air""). 

*Please note: I'm relatively open-minded, but do not subscribe to a number of popular narratives surrounding the subject, as I believe far too many people exploit the vulnerable for personal gain and/or self-aggrandizement, just as has always happened in everything from televangelism to loan-sharking.* "
466,I’ve been experiencing since I was very young.,Abductions,13,"This is a long post and I apologize, but I really just wanted to reach out to a community/anyone that shares these experiences. 

Since I was little, I’ve had very strange and recurring dreams. The first one I can recall included nothing but a huge, swaying, spiky, blue ball. Swinging back and forth. I was four years old, and the feeling that those dreams gave me I still recall but can’t necessarily find the words to describe - they made me very anxious but somehow comforted me at the same time, and I would wake up almost in a trance. I would wake up and immediately walk to the kitchen to get a glass of water, and sit out in our back room, which had a large window over-looking a large field with rolling hills, and I would sit there from 5 in the morning until my mom woke up, around 7. I remember staring at the sky and often seeing shooting stars, but there are a few times that I remember seeing three large, dimmed lights in the sky, rotating in a circle. I can’t count how many times I’ve had that recurring dream, but I feel as if I had it every time I went to sleep when I was little. I slept with my mother until I was five, before I started school. She had the hardest time getting me to sleep in my own bed, or so she thought. I remember night after night for weeks, maybe months, I would fall asleep in my own bed easily, but I would wake up beside my mom in her bed every morning. She, and I, got very frustrated, as I would swear up and down that I did not walk into her room during the night to sleep. 

I was six years old and in school when I finally started sleeping in my own bed successfully, without waking up beside my mom. I started to get night terrors which I vividly remember. I experienced sleep paralysis, and still do. I would always hear growling, gargling, and a noise that sounded as if someone was scratching the underside of my pillow. I could physically feel myself fall into paralysis, as if someone was covering me with a very heavy blanket (I still feel this now, not sure if it’s normal for sleep paralysis), which is how I described it to my mom. I had a very large bedroom as a kid, with three giant stained-glass windows that would reflect cars’ lights as they drove by, and every night I would watch the lights fly across my room, but one night I woke up and the lights were so strong, beaming into my window, lighting up my entire room. I remember immediately having a feeling of terror, my mind was telling me to run away so fast, but I was nearly paralyzed. I remember a very low, constant humming, and watching my arms lift into the air with much physical restraint. That’s the last thing I remembering seeing, and suddenly my mother was walking into my room, broad daylight, apologizing because she had slept through her alarm and that I had definitely missed the bus to school. She offered to drop me off at school on her way to work. I remember rolling over onto my stomach and trying to get up, but I felt too weak. I couldn’t lift myself out of the bed. My mother thought I was faking because I didn’t want to go, and I couldn’t help but start crying in a panic. She walked over to my bed and took the covers off of me, revealing a body full of bruises - an abundance of tiny (dime-sized) blue and black bruises on my legs with a few large green bruises on my upper arms. We were both very confused and concerned, and we still bring it up to this day anytime we’re talking about our old house (a lot of strange things happened there - including TWO family members dying, one during Christmas dinner and the other during a backyard wedding we held). The bruises lasted for weeks - she had me wearing nothing but pants and long sleeves all the while, and I was sweating my ass off in the middle of May. Not long after this happened, I started to get sick, I went for constant tests and check ups, doctors explained that I had high methylmercury levels. I ended up being 6 years old with kidney failure, and I eventually lost one of my kidneys (I have one of those cool old-school scars that I brag about). Since then, I go for dialysis every once in a while and a lot of my levels are always whacked out (iron, blood cell counts, whatever you may) despite being on a very well-maintained, healthy and constant diet. They have been especially off lately.

I have many other strange and mysterious stories from many different times in my life - I’ll go over a few quickly. When I was just a little older, maybe 9, I was outside jumping on my trampoline after school. My neighbours dog came over and started barking viciously at me (or so I thought). I waited for the dog to leave, frightened, tail between legs, and ran for my front door (which was around my house from my backyard, up a small hill). I was met by what I thought was just a very tall, strange man, whose face I couldn’t make out, it was scrambled and incomprehensible. We stared at each other for a few seconds, and I turned around and headed for the side door (couldn’t catch a break!). As I was making my way back, I saw the man come towards me in what looked like a floating motion, and so I started to run. I was just a few steps down the hill when I felt a forceful push from behind and I fell down the hill. My neighbours dog came back and started barking again. My mom heard me screaming and came running down the hill, no one was around, but she saw the dog. My knee was torn up from the fall and the dog was still barking, and so my mom started to claim that the dog attacked me. I told her no, and that it was the large man that was out front. She told me there was no one around, and I was so confused. (She never held anything against the neighbour or their dog, which I loved and played with often). 

Skip a few more years into my adolescence, and more strange things occurred, I had two pet cats who I adored that went missing over night (separately - years apart), waking up with no open windows or doors, no one (that we knew of) coming in or out of the house at night. I had many nights of 12-15 hours sleep with no recollection of even going to bed. Waking up incredibly foggy, confused, going through entire days and not “coming-to” until hours after getting home from school, etc. One night I even woke up, around 4am, laying on my side, propping my head up with my hand, looking at a tv full of static, with my mom asking me what I was doing. That time, you could say, was the straw that broke the camels back. For some reason, that was when it really hit me how creepy these happenings were. I started to look into stories of abductions, alien conspiracy theories, anything I could find, spending hours upon hours of my days and nights obsessing over them. The occurrences became more frequent and tiresome, and so one day, after missing a few days of school in a row, “sleeping” for hours but never feeling rested, worrying my mom, I decided to bring it to a halt.

Cut to current day, we’ve moved twice since then, I’m 21 and as of recently I’ve been experiencing the same sleep paralysis situations, growling, gargling, scratching on my pillow, and the feeling of paralysis coming over me the second I close my eyes - my s/o jokes that he’s jealous that I can simply let me head hit the pillow and fall asleep but little does he know, I’m not waking up feeling rested at all. I began having the same recurring dream that I had when I was younger two weeks ago, and “came-to” staring out the kitchen into my backyard, full of forestry up to the property line, which is what pushed me to reach out to someone - anyone. I’m also having very, very lucid  and recurring dreams of strange, tall, feature-less beings (just like the man that was carousing around the front of my house that I swear pushed me down the hill) casually walking around my room, standing around my bed, and another one in which I’m standing in a field, on the beach, the parking lot at school, and I get “summoned”, for lack of a better word. My health is deteriorating rapidly, I’m always drinking water, eating correctly, exercising and I’m generally not hard on my body. My hair is thinning and falling out in clumps, I’ve noticed my nails are turning yellow, and I’m waking up with new bruises every day. At the gym I’ve been lifting heavier, doing less cardio, and I’m losing more weight and muscle than I ever have. I’m tired all the time because I’m having a hard time sleeping, I’m seeing the same numbers over and over again whenever I look anywhere, it’s always 444. Whenever I get up to use the bathroom or get some water during the night it’s 4:44, I leave college every day at 4:44, I flip to page 444 in my textbooks 8/10 times, even the other day my instructor told us to flip to inventory management in unit 4 - it was page 44. It’s driving me nuts. Am I crazy? Recently everything has been adding up, and I can’t tell anyone about it because of my fear of them telling me I’m crazy and overthinking. I’ve strayed so far from the abduction stories and alien information in general for so long, and I don’t know what made all of these experiences come back, but here I am.
 
Again, I’m sorry this post is so long. If you read the entire thing; kudos! Let me know if you’ve had any similar experiences, I know seeing the same numbers is common (and I’ve read other posts regarding it in this subreddit). Thanks for letting me vent, guys!

TL;DR I’ve been experiencing since 4-5, (seems like) I got abducted at 6, immediately got very sick and I’ve started to experience again recently. "
467,The blue light at my window,Abductions,11,"I have a lifetime worth of memories of being abducted, and it does run in the family (a recent discussion with my aunt who I haven't seen in years has solidified that for me, coupled with discussions with my sister and grandfather).
But, I have a particular memory that I wanted to share with everyone here. 

*After the event told below, my own experience with abduction hyped up for about five years - I honestly believe I was being abducted a couple of times a week. It near ruined my life.*

One night when I was 14, I remember going to bed and having this sensation of ""knowing"". I'd experienced it before on occasion and I just knew that it meant I was going to be visited that night. Sometimes that realisation was terrifying, sometimes not. 

I went to bed, slept, etc.

Suddenly I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw something quickly move out of my eyesight at the end of the bed. I saw it, felt frightened, then ""forgot"" it was there. Like, I could see it but it just wasn't triggering my usual fear response. 

I got out of my bed, walked out of my room, and went to the bathroom. I'm a guy and I had a leak/pee. The whole time I was doing this I felt... Uncomfortable. I knew there was something in my room, but I just couldn't grasp it mentally. 


I finish peeing and walk back to my room. As soon as I open the door I am overwhelmed by a bright blue light. My bedroom window was a sliding door window that opened onto my backyard, and I lived semi-rural. It should have been pitch black. But instead my whole room was full of this bright blue light coming from outside. It was blinding.

Less than a moment after taking in the blue light I felt incredible pain on the back of my head - it's what I imagine being struck with a saucepan feels like. I black out. 


I wake up in bed, under my covers, with the pajamas I was wearing folded inside out at the end of my bed. Zero accessible memory of what happened from head pain till that moment. 


Things escalated pretty quickly from there (but died down a lot after puberty settled), but for some reason that might really stands out to me. "
468,I saw what they're really like,Abductions,13,"One time when I was in their ""world"" or whatever it is...

I was 2 places at once.  One ""me"" was laying on a white raised bed/ operating table.  That ""me"" was absolutely lifeless.  The other ""me"" or I guess you could say my conciousness was hovering above right under the cieling, looking down at my lifeless body on the table, unable to do anything except feel because I'm outside of my body.

I see an empty room with 2 people besides me.  A tall, skinny man standing behind the operating table, my body laying right in front of him, and a beautiful, thin dark haired woman standing at the foot of the bed.  She is screaming uncontrollably.  

The evil man has her under his control telepathically.  The poor woman can't go anywhere.  I am watching from above in agony, not only because I am apparently dead and still concious, but because I can do nothing to save the woman.  I felt a strong attachment to the woman, like we were part of the same nation.  She was not a human woman.  I sensed she was a good person.  And the nice looking man was a monster.  
What I needed to do was destroy the man.  But I couldn't do so much as lift a finger.

He commanded the woman to ""give (max) her eyes."" I started to understand the bad man was killing her to give the dead body- me- some of her organs.  The woman was screaming so much she couldn't get a breath in.  She was also crying continually.  She said ""I am going to be sick"" and then appeared a huge white rubbish bin like a laundry hamper.  She was being sick constantly.  

This one happened months ago and has been emotionally catastrophic as have many, many other of these events.  So I feel like I have seen these other demensions people for what they really are which are primarily: parasites, vivisectors, racists, organ harvesters.  I'm not fooled anymore by the beautiful exteriors.  
The good ones, like the woman I saw, were just being cut up."
469,Anybody had strange phone calls?,Abductions,8,Any experiencers had inexplicable phone calls please tell me about it
470,Wondering if I was abducted...,Abductions,14,"This was about a month ago. It still perplexes me.

TL;DR: I think I might have gotten abducted by aliens. 

So about a month ago, my cousin gave me our family's ancestry paperwork that our grandma had kept. It was very interesting, apparently our family has been here in the US since the early 1600s and several of them fought in the Revolution.

That night, after receiving the papers, I had a very unusual dream.

In the dream, I was in the house we lived in when I was about 6 or 7, but I was an adult in the dream. My dad had gone out to the barn to do chores. He'd been gone for a while and dusk was approaching so I looked out the window to see if I could see him.

Right by our barn was a cluster of hardwood trees. I saw several Gray aliens sneaking through the trees towards the pasture. They seemed like they were in a squad formation: 2 in front, 3-4 in the middle, and 2 in the rear. Upon seeing them, I didn't exactly feel shocked, in my mind I was just like ""huh. So it's real. Ok.""

I went upstairs to get my brother. In real life, our house was only one story, but in this dream it had an upstairs. Anyway, I went up and told him there were Grays by the barn and we should go check on Dad. My brother had some weird body language going on, he seemed very physically uncomfortable. When I told him about the Grays he smiled a really weird smile and said he'd be down in a minute. I went downstairs and waited but he never came down so I went back upstairs.

He seemed even more physically uncomfortable, and then, like he lost control almost, he shapeshifted in front of me. 

He looked like some sort of Gray and Reptilian hybrid. He had mottled skin that had tiny scales all over it, the base color was a dark yellow/brown mustard color and the spots, mainly on his head and arms, were charcoal grey/black. He had several small bumps under his skin where his eyebrows should be. He had no eyelashes. His eyes weren't as large as a Gray's, but notably larger than a human's. His eyes were black with no pupil. His form was humanoid but he had a thick tail shaped like an iguana's.

I just kind of looked at him for a second then told him to come help me get Dad. He started to talk but his speech was very garbled and came out like a corrupted audio file. Midway through his talking, his eyes rolled back very sharply in his head, and they were white but had text on them. 

The text said ""If the audio on this being is corrupted the file needs adjustment"". 2 ""aliens"" who didn't look like Grays but didn't look like my brother either materialized and began working on my brother's head, seemingly adjusting the file. 

One of them said to me ""This won't take long"". But he didn't say it in words, he more ""thought it"" to me, I felt it in my mind.

Then all of a sudden I was in a different room. It was dimly lit and there was a table with 3 aliens who looked like the same ones who were working on my brother. There were papers all over the table, and I went and looked at them. It was my ancestry paperwork.

Again, they thought thoughts into my brain, I could feel their presence in my mind but it wasn't scary. What they ""said"" was: ""Verified"". Several times. And then I woke up.

When I woke up, I was in a very strange position. I was laying on my back, my back was arched up very far, my arms were somewhat crossed on my chest and felt very stifd, and my legs were bent with my heels digging very hard into the mattress. It was almost like someone put me back in bed and tried to bend my limbs back to normal.

I looked over at the clock and it was only about 45 minutes past when I had gone to bed. It was really strange because I never dream that early in my sleep.

So anyway. I don't know if it,was just the bizarre dream of a lifetime or if something actually happened. Thought you guys would enjoy the story though."
471,Bizarre talk show experience possible abduction,Abductions,9,"I *think* I've been abducted into their demension and then returned to this demension over and over again.  I think they've got many different deminsions.  I've been mercilessly harassed all my life by these stupid whatever-they-are people.  By god I'm sick of it.

I know it all sounds crazy but the thing is, I'm not crazy.  I've had many sleep paralysis episodes but then I also have these episodes where I am in their demension.  They also have appeared here to assault me and I have heard their voices as well. I don't expect anyone to take my word for it but I still want to share.  I believe abduction is a real thing, not just a dream or a sleep paralysis or delusion.  This has been going on all my life.

The most recent time where I felt like I was in their demension: 
I was laying there paralysed but was hearing voices of people as well as applause.  My mind was able to ""tune in"" to watch what was going on even though I couldn't move myself.  

What I saw were 2 women on a stage like a tv set along with a man.  Lots of lights and an audience of people sitting in front of the stage.  The man was interviewing the women.  As I started to pick up on bits and pieces of what they were saying.

The second woman was speaking.  She had blonde hair, maybe they both did.  She spoke about how she'd received a child from the first lady.  Insane lady number 1 had gotten a ""troubled"" foster boy, hated the child, and passed the child onto Insane lady number 2.  Lady 2 starts talking about what a bad child/ burden the foster child is but she talks about how she's a martyr for ""saving"" the child.  The audience wildly applauds ladies 1 & 2.

It starts to dawn on me that I am the ""child"" they're talking about, even though I don't recognize any of these people.  

As Lady 2 speaks she sometimes does something very disturbing.  She puts her hands together and mutters weird unintelligible words while her eyes look up at the ceiling.  I somehow understand what she's doing.  Periodically these people stop speaking and make prayers and strange praises to their god.  Whoever their god is.  When they do this, clapping from the audience insues and some people are like crying and whatever.  These people are all batshit insane.

About 4 years ago I started having ""alien"" people appear in my room/house, most of them with extreme violence.  This occurred over a period of months with sporadic ""visitors."". One of the visitors was a fat blonde lady who called me ""so evil...""

I'm starting to think this is all connected.  So depressed because there's nothing I can do about it.  I worry constantly for myself and my family.  If I end up murdered, I'd want people to know that its the ""space people"" who did it.  They'd probably set it up to look like a suicide or like a regular murder but it's them behind everything."
472,experiencing jolts or shifts in reality.,Abductions,7,"for the longest time i have had random moments where it feels like i am jerked in a direction (left right front and back) i can be sitting walking or laying down when it feels like something pulls me hard in a direction. AND I MEAN HARD. it never feels like moving more than a foot, and after it happens im always in the same place. everything blurs like im moving at a high speed and its only for a second buy it throws me off balance and leaves me dizzy. i have started to predict when its about to happen because i feel a hum, its deep and can go on for an hour before the ""shift"" im not sure whats going on but im freaking out. any ideas?"
473,Strange thing happened a while back,Abductions,2,"Around 6 months ago, at night - around 10pm I believe I was on my computer at the time (Can't really remember any specific details) and then went to go lie in bed, I remember feeling incredibly agitated and restless.

I then remember hearing an incredibly unusual sound, sounding similar to a scream or a wail, it did not sound like it came from anyone in my house and I can't really accurately describe what it sounded like, it was something that terrified me and I recall being frozen in my bed and not moving at all. After this point I have a memory of suddenly standing upright in the centre of my room - as in, not consciously going from lying down to standing up, going instantly from having my eyes closed to standing up in the centre of my room.

I have never heard anything like the particular sound I heard before or after this event, I have also never had any prior experience with sleepwalking and I cannot remember anything that happened after the events that I described."
474,Saw him at the window. Now a visceral hate/fear/fascination with greys.,Abductions,32,"When I was little my TV watching was very restricted. I wasn't allowed to watch any scary shows. One night I felt something looking at me through my window, and I went up to the curtains, opened them quickly and I will never forget the face I saw. It was gone in an instant. Years later I saw on a show what an alien looked like and i knew I immediately hated it. My body just froze. The same reaction I had when I saw the one at my window. Even masks at Halloween upset me if they are too realistic to what I saw. All I know is that I didn't trust what I saw and that it was bad. That's all I got from it. It wasn't good. A week later from when I saw it my sister screamed from the garage and she reported seeing a similar description watching her, I hadn't told her the story because she was littler and I didn't want to scare her. Sometimes I joke it's because we had high IQ's back then and they were tracking us and now that my IQ has probably plummeted they gave up on me. That was in the 80's and now I am still afraid at night they will come back for me. My sister, now a psychology major, said aliens represent the unknown in dreams. I have recurring nightmares. The other day I had one where I was in my old bedroom in 1989 and I was laying on the floor and about 4-5 of them were dragging me off. I could hear their feet running and their cold, clammy hands grabbing me. I don't know how to move on from this. I am thinking hypnosis to find out if it really happened - has that helped anyone? "
475,Strange encounters all my life has this happend to anyone else?,Abductions,6,"So I had a very bizarre encounter I've never really been able to explain I've never posted much about it on any paranormal forms or anything like this but I'm kind of tired of Googling and not really finding much besides crazy conspiracy. And I was wondering if anyone else has ever had anything like this ever happen to them and what it was like. So I was about 5 or 6 when this first happened, I was sleeping in my room when I was woken up and I don't remember much but I do remember being led by my hand by a tall glowing creature to a large object out by my childhood home. I was found by the next morning in the laundry room wrapped in my blanket from my bed the door wasn't opened and my little brother was still in our room, werid but still explainable I had a bad dream and went and hid as small kids often do. So I didn't think much of it, then around the time I was 10 I remember seeing strange crafts when I was outside on a bike ride one day following me home from school. I never once felt threated by them, they were big glowing red balls of light. I had many UFO sightings like this and always wondered what they were, but never thought much of them. Untill I was 23 and I had two sightings and one encounter that made me believe that something is going on that I don't understand. I was laying in bed in my apartment and my girlfriend was watching TV in the other room, I was going to bed earlier then normal because I had work the next morning. I was just laying there unable to fall asleep playing with the cat when all the sudden I fell in to what only I could discribe as a trance state again I know this wasn't a dream because I was wide awake (damn insomnia) and suddenly in this trance I saw in my room and could hear this six and a half foot being made up of entirely light his body would change colors and gave off such a feeling of Hope and just generally good feelings. This however was terrifying to me because I was just sitting in my room but I was in awe and unable to move and before I was able to stand up and run to the door to grab my baseball bat. I heard in a clear voice do not be afraid I mean you no harm I come to merely see how you're doing it's been a long time. I asked him who he was and what he was doing here? This is when it gets really weird. But before that happened I snapped out of this trance because I heard my girlfriend yelling from the other room oh my God, get in here there's something outside and she ran into the room and threw open the door when I turned around to see if the creature was still there it was gone. So I got up and ran out to the porch where she said there was something out there we lived on a second story apartment building right by Lake Lansing I looked out over the balcony and could see off in the distance does big ball of red light that moves slowly and silently. I told her what had happened and she goes no way and she told me that the light or craft or whatever it was was just gliding around the porch a few minutes earlier silently making no noise stopped in the middle of the air and she was able to even get a good look at it and see that it wasn't a drone it wasn't a plane or helicopter like I had suggested. I was looking for some reason to disprove what I just seen I had no idea what had happened and couldn't believe it. Then a few weeks later I was on the porch smoking a cigarette around dusk and I looked off over the lake and noticed something out of the corner of my eye floating around the building almost up to my balcony was this small ball of red light that changed size and got then floated towards the river and shot off. I reported it to mufon because I saw they had this sighting map and I saw that many people in my area reported similar sightings around the lake. other werid shit I saw there was once I saw 3 hilcoptors after a seeing a strange disk shaped object in broad daylight. After moving out of that place I still have no idea what I saw what happened and why even to this day I still see strange things in the sky that I can explain. I think it's worth noting because it a lot of these stories always sounded like some hostile Force is coming to get us or experiment with us never once have I ever felt threatened by an object or by an entity in fact it seems like they want to help us but it's hard to say for sure because these are just speculations."
476,My Possible Abduction,Abductions,8,"Before I tell my story, just saying that I'm 13, so I might sound awkward at some points. My story was a week or so ago. It was only for about a second that I remember. I woke up, and I felt like I was sleeping in a car, uncomfortable but yet oddly fun. I felt a feeling I've never felt before, I just felt light. Not exactly, but closest to that feeling you get when you can droop your shoulders and relax. I saw one of my classmates and I remember that part precisely, and we were in this bluish room. (I haven't told him, that would be weird as hell) I wouldn't call it blue, because it wasn't exactly blue. It's  probably one of those things humans do to compare something they've never seen before to something they have. He was knocked out. There were other people my age around, that I didn't notice because of the angle I was at, but we were all in sections like a classroom. The room was lit. So, people were all around me in rows, and I noticed that we were all naked, and there were these clear boxes a bit bigger than the average head, that were on our lower bodies and I could feel my private part being touched in a nice way, and I wasn't touching myself. The last thing I remembered was that good feeling, if you know what I mean, and I woke up. The thing is, you might think this is a wet dream, but I checked and my underwear was clean. This wasn't the only incident. A year or two ago, there were lights that my two parents saw as well. This was amazing to see, and I know anyone that loves space and the idea of aliens would like to hear this. It was a bunch of lights going by, making no noise. These lights were going by slowly, each the size of a street light if you looked straight up at it, and the color of street lights. But remember, we weren't even in a car or moving, and I was probably 12, so it's not like both my parents were drunk and told me this story, I was there. We all witnessed it, and if the FBI interrogated us about it this instant, we would all be able to recall it the same way without the other's help. These lights took at least 5-10 minutes to finally pass by. We were too amazed to get a camera and take footage. My dad had the idea, but honestly, if you were there, would you really want to possibly miss the biggest moment in your life for a few views on YouTube and then dislikes and hate comments saying it's fake? Although. I feel extremely sad that people that professionals that believe in aliens probably won't believe us since we don't have actual proof. Well, before you talk about how fake that incident is, think about planes. Planes aren't even 1/100th the size of a ship that takes over 5 minutes to cross the sky, and they make a hell of a lot more of noise. So no, it wasn't some airplane. Also, I believe the reason this happens around here is because our town's population is only around 500-1,000 and barely anyone comes around here on purpose, and I'd guess that highly advanced alien technology probably would be aware of that, to an extent at the least. I honestly think-No I BELIEVE that the incident of the spaceship was real. I don't know about the second one, but I remember these things like the back of my hand, which to be honest, I don't do for most things. I'm really reaching out to you guys, because I'm too embarrassed to tell my parents about the last incident. How would you even tell your parents something like that? ""I think me and a bunch of other kids got abducted and our sperm was possibly used."" No thanks, maybe at the right time I will but it would be so awkward, and they'll probably think I'm high or something. A side note; I'm the kid that you didn't notice was absent at school because I'm so quiet, and I normally don't find the weird joys most people have that cause them to erupt with happiness, and I really didn't give two craps about space before I saw the lights, but after, I'm not even kidding, I'd spend days without sleeping reading articles about aliens and possibly being able to see aliens or just even space in my lifetime. And I'm a 13 year old boy in the 21st century, I should be more amazed with playing video games, and even I find it weird. Another add-on: I don't actually remember much before I saw the lights, except for my 8th birthday and some creepy giant praying mantis I saw at a park when I was a toddler. Also, I realized that my typing speed and grammar is great for my age, WPM 85-95 (highest being 101), since I don't remember much about before the lights, I don't even know if I had this talent before. I'm editing this in, but also I get a ringing in my ears in the afternoon, which is just loud enough to be annoying but just quiet enough for me not to go insane. It's pretty weird, considering I'm a kid that can type faster than most of the people that read this. Another thing is that sometimes, I want to say something, but there is no word in the dictionary for it. It's so weird. I usually have to use a metaphor to explain what I mean if there isn't a word for it. When I have a piece of paper and I'm bored, I just let go of my hand and it just moves, making weird symbols. I feel like if I was in someone else's body, that I wouldn't feel as tense in my body all the time. Whenever I'm around people I'm not comfortable with and I look at them for a while, my eyes hurt, and they feel strained, like after watching hours of TV non-stop. I don't have bug eyes and I don't bulge my eyes, but at school that happens a lot to me. About the typing thing, I have an idea. This might sound stupid, but is it possible that aliens use something similar to computers and in some way, this affected me or I was used and that's why I type faster than 80% of the population (Once again, I'm only 13!)? I don't know, I probably sound like a complete idiot, so I'm going to end it here. Sorry for taking up your time if this sounds stupid. You can yell at me through the screen for being such an annoying cockroach."

I have some lecture excerpts that you might be interested in. It's from a Buddha Master from the Falun Dafa school of QiGong. A very high level cultivation technique that is very righteous and powerful:

http://www.falundafa.org

I recommend checking this out, especially the book 'Zhuan Falun':

https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/pdf/ZFL2014.pdf

Wow what a read, it covers so many things, from the mysteries of the microcosm to the macrocosm, other dimensions, the soul, ancient prehistory, supernatural latent abilities, chi, gong energy and so many other things.

This practice is also being severely persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party with practitioners being sent to concentration camps, tortured, there organs sold on the black market and often killed:

In these following lecture excerpts, the founder of Falun Dafa, Mr Li hongzhi spells out the Alien Agenda that is upon this earth and it's implications to humanity as a whole.

The rest of the lectures that have been given around the world can be found here:

But in closing, here are the lecture excerpts on the Alien Agenda that is taking place on our planet, I hope you will find them of interest.

Quote:

---

“Let me first explain what alien beings are all about. You know that this Earth isn’t the only planet with life in this universe, and Earth hasn’t existed just this once. I’m saying that at Earth’s position there were Earths that existed before. Those previous Earths were discarded. Some exploded. It happened many times—the number has been quite large. The final stage of an Earth has always been a time when its lives were the most corrupt and its matter was the most impure, so the Earth could no longer be kept. It would be eliminated since the whole sphere had turned into a ball of karma.

The reason is, lives reincarnate . They reincarnate into soil, rocks, plants or matter, and regardless of what they are reborn as, they carry karma with them . Earth would become a ball of karma when karma was all over the place, so at that point it would be eliminated. There would still be some people on Earth who were relatively good, and those exceptionally few or extremely few ones were taken and placed onto another planet within the Three Realms.

Yet through the ages this Earth has been replaced innumerable times and each time there were people who remained. So over time those remaining lives increased in number. The gods in each time period created humans with a different appearance, so the differences are quite substantial, and there are some who were created on other planets. These are alien beings. They’ve become like a record of history , placed there like a page of history left behind . That’s the function they serve, a minor one. They were left behind from the final stage of Earth during those times, and took with them the technology they had in those times over to other planets, so their starting point was more advanced.

Over this long period of time, the knowledge of the universe they came to grasp far exceeds that of the inhabitants of today’s Earth. Their bodies can enter other dimensions and adjust to the mode of those dimensions they are in; they ’ve developed to this stage. Those things they ride in that fly back and forth—those aircraft that human beings call flying saucers—can enter other dimensions and fly into other space-times. If they travel in a fast space-time, after being there for just a short while they traverse a long distance. So that speed is inconceivable to human beings. The types of fuel they use aren’t in the least the kinds of substances conceivable by the technology, theories, or concepts of modern science.

Over the ages, these alien beings have continually been developing and metamorphosing. So in this universe there have really appeared the abnormal social relations that these kinds of lives have. Greed and lust have caused something like star wars to actually happen over where they live. They haven’t yet threatened humankind because humankind doesn’t have the ability to pose a threat to them . So they haven’t attacked humankind.

They would attack humankind if you were to threaten them. Although alien beings haven’t attacked humankind, they know that a human body is the most perfect. They’ve thus taken a fancy to the human body and want to steal it. They saturate all domains of humankind with science to make human beings firmly believe in science and rely on it. When human beings ’ thoughts and way of existence are completely assimilated to theirs, they just have to replace people’s souls and humans will become them, and they will eventually replace the human race.

It’s a long story. They have been coming here full-scale since the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution in the West. They ha d come prior to that time, but they didn’t control people then. Their full-scale arrival began when Caucasian society entered the industrial age. They made full preparations and systematic arrangements for occupying this earth. It was they who created science for human beings . So this science was set up by aliens. Their purpose was to unify human beings and simplify their thoughts to the point of being as uniform as machines. And they unified knowledge to make it easy for them to later on control and replace human beings. Furthermore, they’ve chosen a few nationalities as the vanguards of their future, total control of humankind. Japan is the vanguard that drives technology.

The United States is the vanguard in breaking away from all ancient cultures o n earth. The cultures of even the most ancient and closed-off nations haven’t been able to escape. The whole world is being impacted by America’s modern culture. England was the vanguard in the manufacture of machinery during the early stages , and Spain was the vanguard for mixing the human races. The way alien beings get human beings to shake free of the gods is to mix the races, causing human beings to become rootless people, just like the plant hybrids people make nowadays. South Americans, Central Americans, Mexicans and some people in South East Asia— all of these races have been mixed. None of this can evade the gods’ eyes. Alien beings have made rather extensive preparations for overtaking human beings.

Everyone who know s how to operate a computer ha s been registered. Of course, our students don’t have this problem. Once you obtain the Fa, I clean up that layer of your body that’s been occupied by them. They have formed a layer of their body within the human body. It’s incredibly frightening! Everything people learn from elementary school right up through college is the science they brought , and everything that human beings use nowadays is the product of this omnipresent science. Why do the inspirations people get make computers and technology develop with such tremendous speed? It’s done by that layer of the body that alien beings formed so as to control the human race. It’s exactly because that system of their technology and science that has formed in the human body is making people’s minds do so.

Today it’s incredible how developed computers are. But it is not a human technology. Man will be replaced by alien beings if it continues like this for long. But think about it, everyone: Alien beings are, after all, beings within the Three Realms, where ordinary humans are. There are other reason s why they dare to do this sort of thing. It has happened because the Fa of the universe has deviated and gods no longer look after things.

So it has to do with high-level beings as well. If this situation is to be turned around, it has to begin from high levels. That’s because they have this idea that human beings are no longer any good, their morality has degenerated, and everything is perverted. So they think it’s all right to just replace them , given that they are going to be eliminated all the same. They have to pay for all of the bad things they’ve done, for sure. The principles of this universe are absolutely reasonable toward any life.

So they have to answer for everything they’ve done. As for how their lives will eventually be dealt with, alien beings definitely won’t exist in the future. If there are truly good ones among the alien beings, then their lives can reincarnate as other lives. Bad lives will be eliminated. So everything that every being does positions himself for the future . And that includes all human beings. Whatever a human being does positions him.

That’s the situation as far as alien beings go. They are being swept out up there, and they found out about the cleaning, so they scurried over here, and in particularly large numbers in recent years.

As of right now, most of the alien beings who have come here did so fleeing for their lives. They knew that in the end it would be hard for them to escape, so some alien beings have married Earth dwellers. But it’s not that they marry legitimately, because no one would marry them. They catch a village woman to leave behind their offspring. And there are those who are hiding among ordinary people. They can’t stay under cover no matter how they hide. Immense gong is coming up from the microscopic level.

Whether it be steel, iron, wood, the human body, water, rocks, air, plants, animals, substances, etc., from the microscopic level of everything gong is coming up toward the surface. Tell me, where could they escape to? The gong is omnipresent and rushing up to the surface . So they’ve seen that there is no way to dodge it or to hide from it. How do they exist? The y aren’t actually possessing spirits. But some of them have assumed man’s appearance and walk the streets . You have no idea who they are.

Some have hidden and don’t come out. But the number is now small, very small. In the past they could hide , and their flying saucers could fly up and go to another dimension. But the other dimensions have all been cleaned up. Immense gong is rushing here and they can no longer hide. They can only hide in a cave or at the bottom of the sea in this dimension. Even so, they can’t stay concealed. Anyway, that’s the problem they face . All lives are positioning themselves in this affair. You should know that although alien beings brought their science to human beings to achieve their goals, gods are in charge of everything and are in turn using them.”

“Having seen many movies, having read many imaginative stories, and having been influenced by a lot of things in society, people have developed a warped mindset that indulges in fantasy. You asked how to communicate with intelligent beings. Let me tell you all that an ordinary person can’t do that sort of thing, and he lacks the ability. If you could indeed communicate with intelligent beings but weren’t a cultivator yourself and were without energy, you would be in danger. You might lose your life any moment. Besides, you would see gruesome spirits but no high-level beings, for your level would be too low and limited to only that of humans. So it would be a terrifying situation. It’s even more terrifying if you want to communicate with living beings beyond Earth.

Lives beyond Earth are just lives on other planets within this physical dimension that our human eyes can perceive. Yet those lives don’t regard people as human beings. They think people are beasts, a kind of animal. They slaughter people at will and experiment on you at will. They kidnap people to their planets, lock them in cages, and put them on display as animals. Many of Earth’s people who have gone missing were taken by them. I can also tell you that today’s human science was created by them. Why have those aliens created for humans something like the current science? It’s because what they have on their planet is akin to it.

They want to bring it to this planet and eventually replace humans. They found that the human body is really perfect, flawless. So they covet the human body and want to eventually replace humans. They have added their things into one layer of human beings’ molecular cells. That’s already been done now and it has formed on a large scale. So for me to save you today, I not only have to remove all the attachments and karma that you need to eliminate, but I also have to clean up this stuff for you. The road humankind is travelling down is dreadful. Computers would have commanded people one day. Ongoing developments have conformed to this trajectory. Humans were to become the slaves of computers and machinery, and eventually be replaced by aliens.

Why have computers developed so quickly, and why has the human brain suddenly become so “sharp”? All of this has been carried out by aliens controlling the human mind. Aliens have registered everyone who knows how to operate a computer. For real. As to our students, I’ve cleaned all of that up for them, so that they won’t be interfered with by aliens when they use computers. Why are there aliens? Some aliens originate from their planets. Why do some aliens always come to Earth? It’s because they were once humans on Earth. But it wasn’t the Earth of our time. It was the previous Earth that existed at the same location as this Earth. Earth has been replaced many times.

Each time it was replaced, there was a portion of lives—living beings created by gods with different appearances, some of whom were similar to today’s humans, some of whom had different forms who were relatively good at the time and were thus preserved. They weren’t destroyed, yet they weren’t allowed to enter the period of human development on the next Earth, either. So they were sent to another planet. That’s how it was done every time. Also, it has left a record of this universe, for they were humans on Earth in different time periods. It serves that purpose. But due to a slackening in overseeing them, they have developed, and they have created all kinds of scientific methods according to their schemes; some are like the kind on our earth, some assume other forms, and there are a variety of modes of development. Of course, they don’t use the term “science.”

The names they use belong to their languages and concepts. These things have deteriorated further and further. And with the deviation of the cosmos’ Great Fa, the aliens have become worse and worse too. That’s why all aliens are in the process of being completely eliminated. They are being eliminated throughout the entire universe. At present, those up there have been eliminated. What’s left are only those who have escaped to Earth, who are mingling among people or who have attached to human bodies. And there are other types too.”

“As you know, modern science was brought to mankind by aliens. They came when the Industrial Revolution began in the West. They started with mathematics and chemistry—started from the shallow, simple knowledge of the earliest days—and penetrated on through to modern machinery, and eventually they developed up to today’s computers. As development continues further their ultimate goal will be to replace human beings.

How is the replacement to take place? As I mentioned, in the body of today’s human beings almost everyone has a layer of the body that was created by aliens. Why do I say that? It’s because all of the science that they instilled in you has created a warped human mindset in your mind. There have never been humans like this in any of mankind’s previous civilizations. When the mind is like that, so is the body. As you know, every cell in your body is you, and your brain is connected to the brain in every cell. In that case, the thought processes inside the countless cells in your body are all the thoughts of warped human beings, and the entire body has become like that. This ties into why gods no longer regard man as human. When mankind is no longer human, what is the point of gods’ saving it?

You know that when a person dies, he doesn’t really die. The shell of the layer of the largest molecular particles sloughs off, whereas the part of the body composed of microcosmic particles below molecules hasn’t died. It is separated, as if a person takes off a piece of clothing. It isn’t really dead. Yet the person in this dimension has vanished, since the body needs to be cremated or buried and it will eventually decompose and dissolve. It has departed from this dimension; that is, this layer of particles has disappeared.

Then, as to the alien culture that I was just talking about, it is precisely using man’s own thinking to create the bodily layer that it needs, and it is doing so without man being aware of it. How will they ultimately replace human beings, then? You know that they still have to find a way to replace the shell of the outermost surface of human beings. This is the method of “cloning” that man now wants to use. Gods look after people, and when they don’t look after someone, they won’t instill the elements of life into that person.

This is to say, the reason you are alive in this world is not that you have this flesh body, nor is it because your mother gave you this body that you are alive. It is because you have your main spirit (yuanshen) and the existence of all of your other spirits (shen) that you can live. Why doesn’t a person keep living after he dies and the body is laid down there, since it’s the same body after all? It’s because all of his main spirits have left. That is, if a person isn’t given a spirit and isn’t allowed to reincarnate at the time of birth, he will still be dead after he is born. So what will happen? Aliens will enter.

This is the ultimate means that aliens will use to replace man— that is, cloning humans. Man is being used by aliens to destroy himself, yet he is not aware of it and is still protecting this science, destroying the human race. If humans are cloned en masse in the future, those beings will all be aliens that have reincarnated in human bodies, and there will be no more human race.”

I’ve told you before that because of alien science and technology, one layer of the human body, one of the human body’s layers of particles, has been placed fully under the control of aliens. It consists entirely of alien planets’ elements, including numbers, mechanical structures, electronic components, and so on. It consists of that stuff. And those things are continually creating a warped effect. The large-scale modern industries brought about by science have impacted many low-level dimensions in the cosmos. In my Fa-rectification I’ve found that quite a large layer of the cosmos has been contaminated by those things. And those warped things have had a considerably large resisting effect in the Fa-rectification.

480,Possibility of alien abduction during early childhood?,Abductions,12,"When I looked up this [list](http://humansarefree.com/2015/01/72-possible-signs-of-alien-abduction.html), I noticed that several points apply to me, namely:

- LOST TIME: As a young boy, during the night. I have two detailed memories. Once, I tried to fall asleep; suddenly, time ""skipped"" to morning, the dark window became lit by the light of the sun and I could leave bed. Another time, I was lying in bed and my nanny said goodnight; as soon as I closed my eyes, I could hear her waking me up! Both times, I wasn’t really tired and the time jump was fully conscious!

- TAPPING OR HUMMING NOISES: I hear lots of strange noises in my ears after turning off the bedroom lights - various hums and ringing. Usually, it doesn't stop me from falling asleep eventually.

- FEELING OF BEING WATCHED: Sometimes, when I'm alone.

- UNABLE TO SLEEP: Sometimes, frightening thoughts about aliens keep me awake for a long time. In bed, I feel the urge to look up and check the whole room to see if somebody is inside.

- PARALYZED IN BED: Sometimes, my body refuses to move for several seconds.

- DREAMS OF FLYING: Used to have them with great frequency, I still have them rarely. The flying movement is usually equivalent to swimming in a shallow pool - I am standing up, I willingly ""jump"" up and begin swimming through the air using arm strokes. Usually, I stay close to the ground, but sometimes, I swim up to reach great heights, where my dream ends. The flying is always voluntary and not connected with paralysis. Some dreams abruptly end with a sensation of free fall (e.g. falling off a cliff).

- ""MISSION""/FEELING OF BEING ""SPECIAL"": Yes, I have a feeling that I am ""special"" and that I have some sort of objective.

- PSYCHIC: Sometimes, I know what will happen within several seconds or minutes. And I have had prophetic dreams at least twice in my life - one I can clearly remember is about the speech of my school's headmaster during an assembly. I often have Deja vu experiences.

- EYE DREAMS: I don't remember any dreams of large, black eyes, but I remember a dream about some sort of a disease which made one grow a third eye (when I was little). It was very scary, and I could not sleep for the rest of the night.

- STARTLED: I sometimes awaken in the middle of the night.

- PICTURES OF ALIENS: I get a negative feeling when seeing the picture of a grey. It's just uncomfortable; comparable to jumping into cold water.

- FEARS OR PHOBIAS: I have a mild fear of heights (e.g. pool jumps). However, what is probably more important is the fact that a certain buzzing sound mosquitoes make forces the muscles of my back to contract. This is one of the reasons I hate mosquitoes and sometimes stay awake for long hours in summer, refusing to go to bed until every mosquito in the rook is dead.

- KNOWING PEOPLE W/EXPERIENCES: I know one former Soviet Air Force pilot who claimed that he had seen various aliens (greys, ""energy beings"") and their technologies.

- BLOOD ON PILLOW: I see small blood traces on my pillow sometimes. However, it may come from scratching my face.

- INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT: I have always been interested in UFO's and aliens and like to browse conspiracy websites.

- FOG OR HAZE: I can not recall seeing fog or haze on inappropriate occasions, but I can admit that I have a strong phobia of foggy water and often refused to swim in pools with foggy water when I was a kid.

- NOSE BLEEDS: Very rarely (1-2 times a year) I have spontaneous nosebleeds.

- RINGING IN THE EARS: As already stated above. I hear ringing/tinnitus in one or both ears often, especially during bedtime.

- BEHIND YOUR EYE: I sometimes have headaches that feel like my brain is pressing against my skull and eyes and has not enough space.

- DIFFICULTY TRUSTING: Sometimes, I have difficulties trusting other people.

- DON'T TALK: I sometimes have this feeling. My parents and grandparents are very skeptical when it comes to these topics.

- SLEEP AGAINST THE WALL: When sleeping in a bed standing by a wall, I always sleep with my back facing my wall.

- LOCK ALL DOORS: In boarding school, I lock the door of my room at night.

- NO RECALL: I cannot remember anything directly related to aliens/abduction. If I dream of aliens (which happens VERY rarely), it is usually in a science fiction style that has nothing to do with abductions. Sometimes, I see UFO's in my dreams, however.

- COMPULSION TO STUDY ASTRONOMY/QUANTUM PHYSICS: I am very interested in anything that has to do with space and physics as well as in higher mathematics. I desire to study Aerospace Engineering.

- SEE SAME NUMBERS ON CLOCKS LINED UP: Sometimes, usually during the day. One time, I read an article about waking up at 3:33 and alien abductions - the next day (I was sleeping in a room with an electronic clock), I woke up at night and BAM - as soon as I forced myself to look at the clock, it showed 3:34, suggesting that I indeed woke up at 3:33. Couldn't sleep for the rest of the night due to fear.


I don't have dreams, but I have clear memories of the following things:

- An operation when I was a little boy. I clearly remember waiting at the hospital with my parents, being led to the surgery by a nurse who offered me to play with a toy car and having the anaesthesia mask fitted before breathing in the gas.

- Fireworks. My family lived at an enclosed residental park (a ""country club"") when I was small, and we bought fireworks often, even on non-festive days. We would light them when returning from the city and watch them together with the security guards at the entrance checkpoint. I also remember that my dad lit fireworks on my 3rd birthday in the house garden and that I was afraid and hid behind a car. I remember liking fireworks strongly.

I must say that my intelligence is above-average (according to a teacher, my IQ is ""at least 140"") and that I learned to read at a fairly young age. I always used to read the astronomy section of my childrens' encyclopedia and knew about rudimentary terms (""red giant"", ""galaxy"", ""black hole"") at preschool age. I started playing Microsoft Flight Simulator, Orbiter and KSP in primary school.

Pertaining to health problems - I have nasal polyps, but it seems to be getting better. In the last two years, I had calf cramps in spring, which could be treated by means of magnesium pills. Last summer, I had (unexplained) occurences of cystes inside/on the surface of the eyeballs, which caused reddening, itching, pain during eye movement and discharge of sticky tears that made opening the eye hard after waking up.


tl;dr: Many points from the ""72 signs"" list apply to me.

Do these statements point towards a possible alien abduction experience in the past and/or subliminal contact with aliens?"
481,What just happened,Abductions,2,"This morning I woke up at about 3:30 and unable to get back to sleep I stayed in bed on my phone. It was about 5:50 when I decided I should cut my losses and get up for the day, but then I was overcome with exhaustion and laid back down. I started dreaming but my mind was still awake, I wasn't scared at this point but I was trying to wake up. Failing to do so I then felt like I was moving fast, but staying still as if I were on a boat. I distinctly remember feeling like I was loosing my balance and then I stopped moving fast and fell into thick yellow water. I knew I was in liquid and was aware of the fact that I needed to breathe, but I no longer needed to. After that I heard an incredibly loud noise that got closer and closer until it stopped after that I don't remember much, I do however remember talking but was unable to understand it. Then, the deafening noise happened again but it was leaving this time. Once the noise was completely out of ear shot I was able to wake up. It was 6:00, but it felt like I was asleep for hours. Now, I am sitting alone in my apartment wishing my roommate wasn't going to be gone all weekend. Wtf just happened? "
482,"The Zanfretta Abductions, First Reptilian Contact?",Abductions,0,0
483,Alien Encounter,Abductions,1,"In mid November of 2017 I had a strange dream in which light surrounded me, and I was fully lucid. I mark my lucidity by tattoos (usually they aren't present), but my sleeve was fully visible in this encounter. What looked like a golden kidney bean glowed on the lower right side of my stomach, and I could feel a rapid amount of information enter my sphere of knowledge as I looked into what I can only describe as layers of translucent boards, filled with equations. As soon as I protested, a cheesy image of a joker face with a large smile and sharp teeth appeared on my wall and I woke up.

Since then, fragments of this experience have come back into my consciousness. I remember standing with about twenty people in a locker room, laying on a surface next to a brown headed boy as something was taken from my strapped arm. Though the strangest is one that S. R. speaks of in Extraordinary in which I was strapped to a spinning copper, puckered plate and could not move. I felt someone try to turn me over and take something, again, from my arm.
There were sightings of UFO's in the area I live in the same night this occurred. My boss also had the same dream.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this?"
484,Possible abduction?,Abductions,6,"A few years back my gf at the time told me I had a weird mark on my lower back. I checked and it was rather odd. A series of evenly spaced spots in a pattern. 

I freaked out and found others online talking about having the same markings with photos. They claimed abduction.

This was around a time in my life where for months I would wake up at 3AM every single day. 

Possible abduction?! ..."
485,Has anybody ever seen animals respond to a possible encounter?,Abductions,8,0
486,My First Potential Abduction,Abductions,3,"Last night I experienced something I have never experienced previously. Before I share it with you I want to give you some background on myself.

I am a twenty-five year old guy living with my girlfriend. We have two dogs that sleep in bed with us. I tend to consider myself a normal guy. I don’t think of myself as someone who is obsessed with aliens/abduction theories. Something happened to me last night that made me question if aliens live among us.

It was around 11pm. My girlfriend was already asleep. The dogs were also asleep. For some reason they were not in the bed, they were both laying on the floor. I thought this was weird since they love to cuddle in between my girlfriend and I. I was not complaining though, they tend to take up the majority of the space on the bed.

I laid down on my stomach with my pillow under my head. I pulled out my phone and loaded YouTube to watch some random interesting videos before bed. I looked at a few videos before I came across one with Neil Degrasse Tyson. He was on a late night TV show talking about the one mystery that made him lose sleep at night. I will not go into detail but in summary, he mentioned that the universe was expanding and speeding up while doing so. He said that some of the galaxies that we study currently will not be visible to future generations. He also mentioned that because of this he believed that we may not be able to see things that were previously seen by our ancestors. 

I finished watching this video and decided to go to bed. I put my phone on my nightstand and laid my head on my pillow while still on my stomach. I placed my hands under the pillow as I continued to think of space and the idea of the unknown. I began to think about aliens and the probability of there being advanced civilizations that could travel to our world and communicate with us. 

The last thought that popped into my head was me thinking, “you know what, I wouldn’t mind communicating with aliens. I would love to learn what they could do that we still can’t. I bet it wouldn’t even be scary, just interesting”.

This is where the normal events stopped and the weird ones began.

I don’t remember progressively falling asleep. One moment I was having complete thoughts, and the other I was standing in my parents living room with my girlfriend. The following is my best description of what I will call “my dream”.

I was standing next to a Christmas tree in my parent’s living room. My girlfriend was sitting on the floor next to me unwrapping some gifts. I remember looking down at all of the gifts and thinking, “I did not buy her any of these. These look expensive”. I remember that one of the gifts was an old analog tv with the wheel you had to turn in order to change the channels. The tv was on but there was nothing but static. There was also a wooden baseball bat, an old sewing machine, and some other things that I don’t remember. 

I asked my girlfriend who the gifts were from. She looked up at me and said, “don’t worry about it, you and I didn’t pay for them”. I began to get upset because I wanted to know who had given us all of the gifts. I stated to raise my voice at my girlfriend, demanding that she told me who had given these gifts. 

As I raised my voice I remember the white noise coming from the tv became louder and louder. I could barely hear myself speak. I was having to yell in order to hear what I was saying. As I prepared myself to yell at my girlfriend once again, everything turned off. 

The lights in the house turned off. The television turned off. There was zero light coming through the window. I could not hear nor see my girlfriend who had been sitting at my feet. I did not think of calling out for her. I slowly extended my hand in front of me hoping to touch my girlfriend’s head. I felt nothing. Panic started to set in as I stood there in complete, dark, silence.

The feeling of panic immediately got worse as I remembered saying that I wanted aliens to show me what they were capable of doing. I panicked as I stood still in the darkness. 

From one second to the next I woke up in my bed. I was no longer laying on my stomach. I was laying on my back with my hands at my side. I was completely straight with the pillow perfectly positioned under my head. I looked over at my girlfriend and saw her sleeping in the same position as before. My dogs were also both asleep. I looked at the clock and it was now 4:47 in the morning.

I was not able to go back to sleep. I laid there in bed browsing through my phone until 6:30 at which time I got up for work. I have been doing some browsing regarding the subject but don’t know what to make of it. Hopefully someone on here can shed some light on it.

487,Abduction dreams,Abductions,5,"So mainly I am a paranormal, spirits kinda girl but lately I have been seeing posts on abduction dreams and I wanted to get some feedback on the one and only dream I recall about it. 
I live with my bf of two years,  40 yr old male,  no history of any mental disorders etc ( me - 34 yr old female no mental issues either).... when we were dating about 6 months he told me of an incident about how he found a strange piece of metal/plastic? Buried under his skin when he was very young and he used to have strange dreams of aliens visiting him.. I figured he joking and forgot about it. 
Fast forward a year ( so it's approx 6 months ago) I had the strangest, most vivid dream where I'm in bed in our bedroom and wake up but everything looks like I'm viewing it through night vision ( in the dream I'm alone,  but bf works till 1am so makes since whether real or dream) . After awaking in the dream I see a tripod across the bedroom and walk over to it screaming and terrified....(i could feel their prescenc but could not see them.) .""I know your watching me,  leave me alone"" but there was no sound I could only scream it in my head and couldn't make a sound. .. then I wake up..but I woke up in the  same dream just in black n white not night vision. Then  I really woke up...
This was the most realistic,  scary dream I have ever had,  today it still freaks me out.  I never told the bf because he'd bust my chops but what really gets me is a week after the dream he saw a black triangle in the sky 2 times in a month, came home amped up, freaked n out n swore up n down he was not fucking around. ..."
488,"I think I might have been abducted according to some of the indicators here, anyone else have any resources?",Abductions,1,0
489,Strange encounter,Abductions,4,"So this happened when I was a teenager (33 right now) and I never talked about it outside a few friends, I'm not sure what happened but I would like to know if anyone has seen or heard of something like this
One night was in my house, since the house was being remodel my dad, sis and I used to sleep in a big bedroom together, I awake to go to the bathroom but since remodelations the only one working was in the patio (our house was a colonial house with a yard inside the house, pretty common here in Colombia), once I got out of the bathroom I saw 2 huge yellowish eyes, looking at me from the ceiling, at first I thought it was some kind of cat or something like that, as I took one step forward toward the creature it stood up on it's hind legs and I could see a ""humanoid"" figure, long arms almost 2 meters (6 ft) tall and normal side head looking at me directly.
I should have been horrified and maybe screaming like if I had just seen a monster (I had 13 or 14 years by then) but instead I remember standing there looking at the creature and after a few time (not sure how) it began to walk backwards and disappeared into the neighborhood ceilings (I used to live in an urban area with one or two floor houses) and after it was gone I began walking to my bed as if nothing happened, I remember this really vividly, just walking without thinking, almost like I had to go to my bed, I get there and fell asleep almost immediately, it wasn't until next day I realized something weird happened.

I speak little or nothing about this for years until one night almost 5 years later when my father was going to sell  the house and it had to be painted and a few things fixed so a friend of mine and my GF at that time decided to ""stay"" in the house (it was more a construction site at the time) my GF and I went to sleep and he said he went to sleep on the couch but after a while he wanted something to drink, so he went to the ""kitchen"" (we took a mini fridge and a electric kitchen with us, but we only had electricity in the back of the house), so he went to the yard and he said he saw this tall, weird looking creature, same description as the one I saw years before but I never told anyone before that because I didn't want to sound crazy, he says after a while he began to walk to the couch and fell asleep instantly, same as what happened to me and when he told us about it next morning I was really freaking out.

I don't know what I saw, or what he saw... But if anyone can tell me if there is something similar I would appreciate it a lot because 17 so years later I'm still trying to figure out what happened in that house"
490,"Help put my mind at ease.. Strange alien-related dreams, and apparently I've started sleepwalking out of nowhere?",Abductions,25,"Just to preface, I am married but my wife sleeps in the nursery with our baby (amazing 1y 2m old little girl) - partially because we have yet to break co-sleeping, and partially because I snore like a chainsaw revving up.  Normally, I have a dog with me and she has the other.  These dogs.. they're the greatest guard dogs in the world.  Or the worst.  I haven't decided.  They bark at ANYTHING out of the ordinary, from loud trucks to cats making noise in the other room.  They have been silent at night.

Wednesday of last week, I woke up around 3:30 laying across the bed.  My legs were where my left arm would be, hanging out of the covers, and my head was where my right arm should be.  When I woke up like this, it was incredibly disorienting, but I jumped up with energy and just stood in the dark for a bit trying to get my bearings.  My dog, who is a 75 lb. pit bull mix, had been curled up next to me, but he didn't really seem to think anything was out of the ordinary.  I had to pee, so I took care of that and went back to bed, no problem.  The next day at dinner, totally unprompted, my wife asked me what I was doing up in the middle of the night.  I hadn't told her what happened in the night.  She's a fairly light sleeper with the baby, but she said she heard me walking around the house in the middle of the night.  She said she knew it was me because she recognized my footsteps and the dog with her - a ~45 black lab mix - got up to sniff near the door and determined it was okay.  Alright, so maybe I'm sleepwalking now?  Strange, but whatever.

The next night passed uneventfully.  The third night (Friday), my dog wouldn't join me in the bedroom.  I'll admit, I'd gotten a little angry with him earlier in the night when he knocked over my daughter, so maybe he was skittish.  I woke up sleepwalking again.. maybe?  I felt like I was dreaming and doing some sort of weird Twister-like game.  I woke up with my weight on my knees on the bed like I was kneeling.  Once I came to again I sprang back up and stood in the dark for a second trying to get my bearings.  Checking my phone, it was 3-3:30ish again..  Went to pee, back to bed.  But this time I had a dream..  Let me preface this by saying that 1) at no point in this did aliens come to mind.  I thought maybe I was stressed out at work and it was manifesting in strange ways.. and 2) I don't personally believe I've been abducted by aliens.  But I'm curious about what the rest of you have to say.

So.. I dreamt that I was in a facility of some sort.  It was controlled by various types of aliens, which seemed to be the standard Greys or maybe a little different.. they seemed to have large heads that were pale human flesh colored, large eyes - about as big around as coffee cups, set far apart.  These are what I mainly saw roaming the facility.  I was kept in almost like an apartment that looked a bit like a private medical suite.  Reclining bed, machines all around, bathroom, but a TV on the wall.  Very gray and white and sterile.  I could leave, but I'd be closely watched.  The halls seemed to be filled with dozens of other rooms like mine.  Somehow I just knew where I belonged.  The aliens were everywhere.  There were other people roaming around.  Some didn't walk normally.  We were all in blue-gray outfits.. almost like scrubs or prisoner uniforms or something.  The ones who didn't walk normally seemed to be ""employees"".  The only way I could seem to go would lead to almost like a grocery or cafeteria area.  You could get food and take it somewhere to eat or go back to your room.  I remember seeing a particularly good looking slice of pepperoni pizza, and it was the only one left.  I got to it at the same time as an older lady and she let me have it..  I put something else on my plate but I forget what.  An alien watched impassively as I took it back to my room.  About the time I got back a couple ""employees"" came by with a cart to bring me my ""medicine"".  I didn't want to take it.  They insisted.  I woke up.

Every night since then (which, granted, has only been a couple) I've had some variation of that dream, or I've been back in that place.  One was fairly mundane, but last night I remember last night I had to mimic the strange walk of some employees because I was out of my room when I wasn't supposed to be. They haven't been as vivid as the first.. I don't recall being startled by the aliens in my dreams as I'm sure I would be in real life.  I just accept them as normal there.

So what's going on?  Am I just stressed out?  Is something really happening to me?  I don't feel like I'm gone long enough to experience any ""missing time"" except when I'm asleep anyway.. "
491,Possible abduction?? Or very vivid dream?,Abductions,17,"This happened a few months ago. I fell asleep and had a “dream” that I was at home with my family in our old house. Our front door was opening and looking outside you can see our Jeep and that the doors were open. Upon looking outside I could see two astronaut suits sitting in our car. They waved. And I hesitantly waved back. I turned back to my living room and the two suits were now in my living room sitting in the car seats that they were just in. My whole family was seating on the couch. The two beings got up and took of their suits revealing that they were some sort of evolved big cats??? Came up to us and did usual cat stuff.  The entire time I was very uncomfortable and knew something wasn’t right. I whispered to my mom that we should kill them. I walked to the kitchen and as I was opening a drawer to get a knife I felt something behind me. I turned around and felt this insane painful vibration. Like something being drilled into the side of my leg. With my mom and brother standing above me. It was so painful that I woke up screaming. NOW I’ve heard that aliens may mess with your memory and make it seem that your abduction was just a bad dream. But I NEVER ever dream or remember them. Or even have very VIVID dreams. Idk I just thought I’d share.
Thanks for reading. "

493,UFO Research Group,Abductions,3,"The Bureau for Paranormal-Supernatural Research & Investigation is looking for new investigators and support personnel. The organization is still in a very nascent stage, but I think it offers a lot of things that just aren't there anymore.

Before I go into detail about the organization, I'll give you a tiny bit of background about myself and why I think this is necessary. My name is Chris, and my interest in the unexplained started from a very young age when I spotted something strange in the night sky. I saw what I would later discover is a proto-typical triangular UFO that seemed to stop and vanish. 

This one experience was it for me, and I became interested in all things dealing with extraterrestrials and abductions. As an adult, following an enlistment in the Army, I started my own blog called 'Contact Blog'. At one point I was getting a large amount of traffic, including people that would email me reporting that they had been abducted.

I was at a loss for how I could help these people, so I largely referred them to MUFON and other organizations. A few months later though, I read more about Robert Bigelow, and learned that I had be unwittingly feeding direct sources of this phenomenon into a black-hole from which nothing returns.

It was then that I decided I would start my own investigative group. I have seen some others floated on here, but I feel these organizations fall short in some cases or have ulterior motives otherwise.

So, what sets the Bureau Apart?

1) Democracy. Our charter has a Central Committee that is elected by the membership. This committee decides if there will be dues, how those dues will be spent, etc. This committee also picks the Board of Directors who make up the leadership working-group and decide what cases are worth-while to pursue.

2) Community. Ours is a community organization. I imagine we will incorporate at some point as either a 501c3 or 501c7; and the democratic nature and sort of cooperative 'ownership' will be integral to this. In addition to this, we will have a very 'motivated' working culture. There will be a clear cut chain of command with clear directives given for a task (such as an investigation) and results expected. This as opposed to assigning a case number and say, selling some random investigatory gear.

3) Expertise. The Bureau is going to attempt to attract people with specific expertise in fields important for the investigation. But more than just seeking out expertise, we have processes in place which promote it. 

4) Integrity. We will attempt to eliminate conflicts of interest. Most importantly, this organization's goal is to investigate, not to profiteer off it's membership. Which is the reason why Democratic mechanisms were implemented.

5) Common Good. Robert Bigelow and his monopoly of information was one of the main reasons I started this organization. One of our stated goals is to use our findings for the public good and to be transparent with our investigations. We will offer final reports as well as dissenting or confirming opinions to the public at no cost.

So yeah.

I know this is not the first organization of it's kind. And there was a recent one created that I almost threw my lot in with. But after a bit of research, I concluded the best option was to continue developing this organization.

494,Looking for UK Abductees for University project/ blog post.,Abductions,0,"Hey Guys, first time posting here so let me know If I'm doing anything majorly wrong. 

I'll get right into it, I'm a 3rd year Journalism student, and for my final project I have been tasked with making a magazine based of life experiences. 

Abductions have always been an interesting topic for me, I love hearing about people's experiences with the unknown, and would kinda like it to be the basis of my magazine. 

So, I'm currently looking for people in the UK, who would be willing to be interviewed (probably via skype, unless close) for the magazine. 

The magazine itself won't be published, but the article may be if the people are involved consent to it. 

Not sure if I should post my email along with this, encase anyone wants to contact me directly, I guess there's always DM. 

Thanks everyone. "
495,I think i was abducted...,Abductions,3,"Two weeks ago, me and my girlfriend went on a weekend away in Salisbury (UK), stayed in a lodge out in the sticks. Had a good night, played some drinking games, watched a couple movies, made pizza etc. Then later on on the Saturday night she fell asleep midway through watching Kill Bill 2, im one of those people who struggles to sleep in a new bed so i stayed up on my laptop to finish the movie. Eventually i blacked out then awoke unable to move, i'd guess around 2 hours later, maybe 2am. I could hear a loud, high pitched whine, I guess the best way to describe it would be, in video games when a grenade goes off near by and your player goes deaf for a few seconds, that kind of noise. It was penetrating, like it was rattling my brain. I could hear nothing else. I could move my eyes, and managed to look around me, I could only make out two very tall, dark figures. I say dark, but the room was dark so I have no idea what colour their attire was. But they were menacingly tall, like 7ft tall. I was woken by my girlfriend the next morning at 11am, she had been up since 9 and left me to sleep. I felt dizzy for the rest of the day but nothing too extreme. I've not mentioned it to her or anyone else, but im a very skeptical person and all i can say is i have no rational explanation except perhaps sleep paralysis, which ive never had before. But from my research, it seems to account for most 'abductions'. I just wish I could remember more but my mind is totally blank after that brief glance at the figures. Has anyone experienced anything similar?

We stayed here FYI:

496,Metallic Room with Lights,Abductions,0,"This is my first post to this subreddit! I'm trying to understand this phenomenon, as well as the entirety of the UFO/alien phenomenon, and I believe that my curiosity, coupled with past experiences, has been attracting attention. Kind of like the saying ""be the change you hope to see"" but in an environmental application.

Anyway, on to the story. So a week ago or so, I saw a black figure dart across the street where I take my morning and evening walks. It was during the early evening when this happened. That's another story and I've posted it on my page if anyone cares to read it.

Around the same time, I woke up after sleeping for a bit. I checked the clock on my phone and it said it was 12:24 AM. I used the restroom, scrolled through Facebook, and I assume I went back to bed. I have no recollection of going back to bed, but I must have been out like a light. 

I don't remember much, but I believe I may have had an OBE type of experience. I remember opening my ""dream"" eyes and being in a darkened room made of a pewter colored metal. The ceiling was coffered, and each section had a dull light. I felt no fear, only curiosity. I focused on the room, then noticed that the lights flickered when I did so. Intrigued, I began focusing more on these lights, and each time, they would surge and flicker more and more. Eventually they surged to a point where light flooded my entire field of vision, and I woke up in my bed. 

I had assumed I had been asleep for quite a while, so I expected it to be around 2 AM or so. I was shocked to see it was only 12:45 AM when I checked my phone. At the time, I shrugged it off, happy to have more time to sleep before my alarm rang.

In the morning, I walked my dogs and passed the streetlight in my yard, and a familiar feeling from the previous night left me pondering the reality of what had transpired. "
497,Government Staged Alien Invasion Possible? Evidence is Saying Yes!,Abductions,1,0
498,"Trying to pull myself together, Need help to tell my story",Abductions,8,"First of all I will go right ahead and say it. I WAS ABDUCTED.  And I know exactly what saying that will bring. I am crazy, I am making things up, I am looking for attention, whatever. I really do not care what anyone will say but I need to get my story out. 


What I need is help to get my story out and also a way to protect myself as well in the process. I am looking for guidance in that. I want to record everything I know and talk about everything I can remember. I am also afraid to be recognized and silenced before I get all my proof and messages out to the world. 

My plan is pretty simple, I want to turn on a camera and start talking about everything, Also I want to show the proof that I have that will absolutely show that there is no way to deny what has happened. I have gone through some major changes during this that would be impossible to if not for a honest to God miracle, I'm talking biblical. Now I plan to start recording immediately, constantly, and consistently. I need help on saving everything in a way that if I was to disappear then everything would be automatically uploaded somewhere for everyone to see. I need to also know how to protect myself in the process, as in how do I keep my identity hidden until I get everything out there or forever. I know nothing is forever I want to stay anonymous as long as I can. And trust me when I say this, I already know I will not be around long enough to see the veil lifted. 


Into a little about it, trust me or not this a little to let you know what is up.

I was abducted. I was away from home when it happened and all by myself. When I came back there was some time difference between when I left to when I came back. A MUCH shorter time then what I was really gone though. It did not happen like anyone has described or anything I can find reported by anyone. I was not harmed, probed, or physically studied. The time away and where I was is the real story here though and I will get into that later when I know how to safely do so. When I got back I was physically different than when I left. Things that can be shown and measured. I also have before and after photos.  

Before I left I was a pretty average guy. I will not go into specifics of me but I played the game PUBG, I was big into politics, browsed r/the_donald and /pol a lot especially for what was going on at the time, I liked to go outdoors, and I had a GF that was not currently in the country that I reside. Now I am back. There was about a day in this time that I had lost. I also had to remember where I was and where I needed to be. First off my vehicle was inop due to the situation, I had no phone on me anymore, and I couldn't remember exactly where I was and how to get back. I mean I had a rough idea but not an exact path. I eventually made my way and got that all figured out. By the time I go home it felt completely different, like a dream I guess. Nothing felt as if it belonged to me and like I was just visiting a friends house or something. Eventually I turned on the computer to find some emails from my GF. My stomach felt sick, I completely forgot about her. She had been wondering where I was and was worried that I got lost or injured when I was out. I got to talk to her on my spare phone and It was like I had no idea who she was anymore. She joked that she thought I might of been cheating on her, I think I will tell her that I did. I can not see her or talk to her right now, and like I said, if we were to video chat she would see the difference immediately.  I was in college also, but since I have been back I have not even shown up, kind of forgot all about that and I don't see myself going back either. 

For someone that has so much to say, I am not sure what else to say. 

I need help, I need to tell it all and show the world what can happen and what has. I need to live through it until it is done. I don't know where to turn, I know this is not the best place for it but my time before was spent on reddit so I guess this is where I start. 

Thank you everyone."
499,Looking for Answers,Abductions,10,"This is going to sound fucking crazy and definitely made up, but I need to get this out there. Not sure where else to post this. So this just happened two nights ago. My girlfriend and I are both 19 and live together. We're both attending the same community college in California before we transfer to a much bigger university in about a year. My girlfriend is a Microbiology major who's working on her nursing degree. She has a class/lab combination class that runs from 5:15pm to 10:40pm once a week. We only have one car and I had a lot of studying to do and was planning to use the school's free wifi to do it on my laptop. Here we have a really large 5 story science building, and each floor has a closed terrace with a few tables set up, and a large opening with a view of the sky. While I was working, I happened to look out and saw some very dim lights in the sky. They were moving in a lind of circular motion, but randomly and without any pattern. There was always at least 1 circling up there, with up to 4 more swirling around it. They would overlap sometimes, speed up, slow down. I didn't think anything of it at first, but soon it really started to bother me. I was staring at them, trying to figure out where they could be coming from and I couldn't figure it out. I even tried recording them and taking pictures but they were tpo dim to appear on my shitty phone's camera. ThenI got up and walked downstairs from the 3rd floor I was on and started to walk towards them and find the source. The time then was around 8:30.  They were directly above a large dirt field where they're developing a large building to house livestock in, and I walked to where I seemed to be directly under the lights and looked up at them. They got brighter for a brief moment, and then disappeared completely. As soon as they were gone I got this awful sensation in my arms and legs, like the kind you get when they fall asleep, but all at once and uncomfortable as fuck. My head also started pound like I got hit with a fucking bat, my ears were ringing and my vision got blurry. I turned around in a panic and fell on my face in the dirt since I didn't really have control of my legs. This all happened in a fraction of a second. I got up after I was able to function and stumbled back across the field to the building I walked from, I was going to go upstairs to get my girlfriend from her class. In that state it was all I could think to do, my head was throbbing so badly I could hear my fucking pulse and I couldn't function. I pulled on the door and it was locked. I looked around and realized all the lights in the buildings were off, the only light was from the streetlamps that lit the walkways. I pulled out my phone. The time was exactly 1:37 AM, over 5 fucking hours had passed somehow. I had about 50 missed calls from my girlfriend and just as many missed texts asking where I was and if i was okay. I just sank to the ground and held my head in my hands until my migraine died down enough to speak. I called her, she frantically asked what happened, where was I, was I okay, etc. I just told her I was at the college and needed to be picked up. I sat in the same spot while she drove over with the friend she had called when she couldn't find me, they'd been going around to my parent's, grandparents and friend's houses looking for me. She stayed on the line the entire time asking questions I couldn't answer. After they picked me up I tried to explain what happened. I know neither of them really believe me. She took me to her parent's house and we stayed the night there. Her mom was a nurse and has all sorts of medical degrees and wanted to be in the same house after hearing what I told my girlfriend. Everyone thinks I've had a mental breakdown and I don't know what to say. I called of work for the next few days and have just been lying in bed all day, I don't have the strength to really do anything or eat much. I feel so weak and drained, and I've been having really bad migraines and stomach aches that come and go and that pills won't help. I know from the way everyone whispers when they think i can't hear tjat they either think I'm lyimg or losing my fucking mind, and I guess I might be. I have suspicions about what happened but I don't want to jump to conclusions. If anyone has any kind of explanation or anywhere else I can post this where someone might I would really appreciate it.

502,They come in pairs.,Abductions,6,"I believe I am at least the fourth generation of my family to be part of some kind of long-term alien project. Just what that project may be, or why they are interested in my family, is still a mystery to me.

The aliens I recall (I saw a pair of them them quite clearly at the foot of my head in 1993) are not the well-known 'Greys.' Mine have coppery-orange colored skin similar to that I've seen in some ants. Their eyes are enormous, pitch black, slanted at about a 30 degree angle relative to their midline, with well defined cheekbones, no discernible nose, and a small, lipless mouth that is very down on their faces. On the sides of their heads their is some kind of rough detail -- perhaps an organ that I cannot identify. I believe there are at least two morphological types: the shorter ones that I've just identified and another taller type with gigantic crania. This second type appears to be in charge. They are terrifying if they get into your head.

The shorter ones wear tight fitting dark 'uniforms' that remind me of scuba divers' suits. On their chests are affixed gold colored squares with a number of symbols in a grid pattern. I believe this is an instrument panel of some sort. The backs of their heads are covered with what again reminds me of scuba diving gear.

My great-grandmother used to tell stories of strange little men in dark suits standing at the foot of her bed way back in the late 1800s. They terrified her so much that she refused to sleep by herself. Unfortunately, I never knew her and have no more details of her experiences. My mother on the other hand was plagued by night terrors that she refused to discuss. She suffered from extreme depression and neurological disorders. She died at age 54.

I'll continue this later with some of my own experiences and recollections.

503,Possible Abduction??? (idk),Abductions,2,"I was around 6 years old, way out in the country hills of Grand Saline Texas. I went to bed one night, this night was like any other, me scared of the dark and everything else in my room. My bed was positioned against the wall the door was on, and on the wall parallel to the bed(the wall in front of you when you walk in) also has a window. So it was about 8:00pm, and there I was lying in bed, looking out the window, at the night sky, and then suddenly it's as if someone hit the fast forward button on time. I watched the sun come up over the horizon in about 5 seconds. The moment time was back to normal, my step-dad(at the time), walked in and told me to get ready for school. I didn't feel nauseated or sick at all, time LITERALLY just flew before my EYES! . I remember going about the whole day telling all my friends and my teacher about the event, and their explanation was this: ""You probably just slept with your eyes open"". Not long after that, I had a night terror, so scary enough that I woke up screaming my head off and then bawling my eyes out of existence. This nightmare however, was unlike any other nightmare I've had since then. The images that I had seen are a bit vague now that I'm 17, but the emotions that I felt in that dream were so astronomically strong. The ones that I can recall are Anger, Sadness, but the one that I felt most of all was Fear. INTENSE Fear. Now I'm going to get a possible problem out of the way before I end this. There is another story out here somewhere on reddit, very similar to mine. Another guy when he was young had possibly the same experience as I with time just flashing by. He had sat down on his bed, and in mid-turn to lay down, it was suddenly morning.  That's the only reason that I'm posting this story in the first place. I had looked up ""Alien abduction stories"" on Google and I saw that guy's story, it reminded me of the wonky shit that I had witnessed.So there is my childhood story of some weird anomaly with time. Maybe."
504,Alien Abduction 5 Years Ago.,Abductions,6,"Hey Everyone,

I just created an account here on reddit to tell you all this story. Maybe you'll find it interesting maybe you'll find it boring, me and my friend involved have never been able to explain it and most of the people we tell the story too just laugh it off. We aren't really offended by people not taking it seriously because nothing bad really ever came of it but maybe you all will have a little more insight.

So me and my best friend (still best friends to this day) were having a sleepover at his house. We live about a block away from each other so we would hangout almost every weekend. Anyways, we were having a sleepover at his house and we got to hang out in the living room that night. His house is packed by the way, he had a lot of family living in that house but at night everyone was asleep. So we're in his living room having a great time, We might of been watching a paranormal TV show (might of been fact or faked) because we we're really into that ind of stuff when we're 13 (still are lol) or whatever. Anyways im sitting on the big couch in an upright position and so is he, I believe we just got a huge plate of chips and we were really having a good time - we were wide awake, just got chips, and were laughing and watching the show. It had to be after Midnight which was early for us considering we would stay up till 5AM every weekend playing video games and whatnot. 

Here's where it gets weird...

The next thing we know, we are both waking up the next late morning/early afternoon with blankets on us, both in the fetal position on the couches we we're sitting on the previous night. We both wake up at the exact same time, it wasn't a jump up more like a gradual awakening at which point we both looked at each other. I don't really remember the in between details after that but I remember asking ""Dude, Do you remember going to sleep last night?"" to which I got ""No...I Don't..."" The weirdest thing is we were literally both just laughing and having a good time, how do you go from being wide awake to not remembering going to sleep? We would of had to get up, turn off the light, throw the chips away, and grab the blankets. And even if someone in his house came and did all that after we fell asleep, why the fuck don't at least one of us remember the process of going to bed? Occasionally one of us would start to fall asleep playing the game or whatever or watching a movie but we would always wake one another up and ask ""You ready to go to bed?"" even if the other was knocked the fucked out. 

I can't remember if we we're freaked out at that point when we woke up but we've recalled the story exactly the same ever since. I don't think anyone was home when we woke up as most of his family worked or slept in late or went wherever they go so we didn't ask anyone about it.

I've never had this type of missing time before or again. I've personally had a small experience with missing time and I think I will write that in another reddit post, linking this one. Tell me what you think. Thank You.

505,Missing Time - (Alien Or Something Explainable?),Abductions,1,"Hello again reddit! So I just posted for my first time on this forum about an Alien experience me and my best friend had a few years ago (maybe it's alien, we are not sure) Anyways this is a followup, maybe the two are connected I don't know. You can check the story here 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Abductions/comments/6us6q6/alien_abduction_5_years_ago/

Anyways, let me ask you about this missing time situation that has happened several times in my life. Two at the least. It happened completely at random and i've never been able to explain it but when I was younger (Maybe 10+) This thing would happen, very rarely, where I would lay down to sleep, literally blink, then wake up fully rested. There was no gradually falling asleep and there was no gradually waking up. I would put my head down, blink, and it would be morning and my body would be in the exact same position as I was when I had put my head down the night before. This wasn't like being exhausted from walking all day or something and coming home and knocking out, that feels really good and although your out maybe in 10 or so minutes, you have that feeling of rest then  you have the feeling of waking up. 

I haven't been able to find anything online about this but I did talk to my dad about it and he said it has happened to him twice in his life. My dad said it happened when he was at his cousnins house and was confused when he woke up and again either at our old apartment when I was 2 years old or at our current house. We both think the experience is pretty cool rather than scary but the only missing time answer I could find was in the extra terrestrial. My mother said she doesn't remember this ever happening to her, but she does have dreams of being levitated and she says that what ever is doing it wants to get her out of the house, she's not scared of this either and only brought it up when I asked her. I only bring up my mother because of the possible alien relation.  

What do you guys think? Series of coincidences or is there a legit medical explanation for me and my dad blinking and waking up fully rested. Let me know if this has happened to you, or you know about it. Thank You."
506,Series of Strange Events: 2 Shared 2 Personal,Abductions,0," I was around 4 when I saw my first UFO. My mother, sister, and I were driving home from swimming at a local lake. The sun had already gone down but it was still fairly light out. My mom pointed out to us that there was a strange object hovering in the sky moving around in no particular direction. It was your 'basic' UFO, rounded at the bottom, a wide center, but was slightly narrower at the top. My mom stopped the car and we got out for a better look. My mom took several pictures. My mother and sister reported no strange occurrences before or after we saw it. However, after this event took place I began having strange nightmares of the craft landing, seeing it open, and watching as white figures, around 4ft tall, walk out. The light from inside was bright and I could not make out ant significant details besides short, thin, and actually quite human shaped. These nightmares stopped about a year later, but only after another experience I will explain below. While gathering more details from my mom and sister I realized I didn't remember anything between seeing it and being in the car driving home; I specifically asked them if they remember getting back in the car and none of them do. My mom said she doesn't remember half of the ride home, but figured it had to do with spacing out while driving (a lot of people go in 'trances' while driving with out realizing it, it's actually fairly common and does have a scientific explanation) and my sister said it was probably just because of how long ago it was. 

Like mentioned above, I frequently had nightmares of seeing it land and seeing figures emerge, but they stopped after this occurance. It was probably no later than a year later when I woke up in my room. I remember being incredibly thirsty, like I hadn't drank in days. I got up and walked towards the kitchen. Before I reached it I saw flashing lights coming through the bay window in my living room. They kind of reminded me of police lights but we're moving around. A blinding bright light filled the whole room and I tried to scream but couldnt. I don't remember anything after that except waking up in my bed. After this all the nightmares about aliens stopped, but I remember being afraid of being abducted while I was asleep before I even knew what it was or possible. I always kept my door locked and triple checked my windows.
 
In between the this event and the next I had a weird experience which I cannot tie to aliens directly. I would wake up early in the morning, wait for my dad to leave for work, and then climb into bed with my mom, I tip toed into her room and climbed in bed to hear. As funny as it sounds hearing her snoring helped me fall asleep faster. As I tried to fall asleep I remember hearing the door open and I opened my eyes and shifted them to it. I saw a tall dark figure and at first I thought it was my dad coming back in, but as it moved closer I saw it had like a suit and coat on with a top hat. I tried to yell and wake my mom, but I couldn't move or talk. He walked towards me, leaned down, and looked at me. I couldn't see any features but I knew I was staring right into his eyes. I was terrified, I wanted to hide. He started to reach his hand out towards my face, but my mom started to wake up so he quickly left the room and disappeared down the hallway. My mom woke up and asked me to shut the door, but when she saw I was crying she turned on the light and just told me it was a bad dream. After, I used to be terrified of doors, when I was alone I would open every door in my house and turn on all the lights, periodically checking each room to make sure no one was inside, with time it eventually went away. 

Since then, I haven't had many weird experiences. The only one I can recall was about a year or two ago when my mom and I were sitting on the porch smoking a cigarette. She pointed out some glowing orbs in the sky and asked me if I knew what type of star/planets it were. I looked up and realized they were moving. We watched for at least 5 minutes as these orange orbs moved lazily across the sky moving side  to side slightly. Originally 3, they split into 7 before disappearing in the distance. 

I would love to hear any kind of feedback whether it's from a skeptic or a believer. I would love to hear other and similair experiences. If you have any information either comment or message me, if anyone is serious about having a discussion I was pm you my email. "
507,1 Personal and 1 Shared: My experiences,Abductions,1,"The first happened when I was a very young kid. I was riding in the car with my mother and I think my cousin and sister, we were driving home from the lake. We drove past a field and my mom pointed out what looked like a ufo. She cannot remember whether she stopped or not, but, I remember her stopping. She has no recollection of the rest of what happened besides driving back home but soon after I had several nightmares of seeing it land, my mom stopping the car, us getting out of the car, and seeing figures coming out of it but then everything else goes blank- these nightmares only lasted about a year and I've only had a few scattered ones since then, but none recently. This happened when I was probably around 4-5 years old. The weirdest part is for the longest time I thought it was only a reoccurring childhood nightmare until like not even 3-4 years ago my mom mentioned, when I brought up aliens, that we saw one when I was a kid while coming home from the lake and my mind exploded because suddenly I realized it was all real. I talked about it with my mom for a while. It was really scary. However, my sister and cousin have never said anything, my mom doesn't remember anything after seeing it and going home.

The second happened also around this time maybe a year or two afterwards and I cannot say whether this happened for real or not, it happened when I was kid and could have been a dream (even though it was completely different from the others I had), as I said above I frequently had mini nightmares of the first encounter. I remember waking up in my bed and being incredibly thirsty so I got out of bed and walked down the hall towards my kitchen. I remember seeing lights flashing in the corner of my eye so I turned my head to look through the windows in my living room and saw blurry, multi colored lights. They reminded my of looking through a frosty window at Christmas lights, and kind of like police lights flashing. Everything turned completely white and I tried to scream, but couldn't and the next thing I know I woke up and look towards the table in my room and I do see a cup of water that wasn't originally there. The only reason why I bring up this story is because it's not my only experience. Had it been an isolated incident I probably wouldn't think anything of it. I am skeptical because it seemed like a dream, I cannot recall having any other dreams or memories of anything else pertaining to this incident and also there were other people in the house with me and we lived in a neighborhood with houses very close to each other. 
However, in the past year I have done research and came across TWO reports from the town I live in (One from 2am the other from atound 6-7) saying in 2003 a women witnessed a UFO in the early morning hours not far from my house, they both said she could see it above the treeline, and maybe I'm just grasping at straws but it's seems too likely to be a coincidence.

508,Visitation from extraterrestrial.,Abductions,6,"First off I need to say if you've ever experimented with mushrooms, you'd know that in small doses or your first hour or so before peaking, the effects are not all that strong and you're not really seeing things that aren't actually there. This event was experienced by me and another person, both under a mild influence of psilocybe cyanecen mushrooms. I know this is breaking rule 10 but I don't know where else to post this. Please hear me out before discrediting my story.

I've stopped telling this story to people because once they hear the fact that hallucinogenic mushrooms were involved they automatically discredit any further observations that, mind you, were BOTH witnessed between me and my girlfriend that night. So i'm taking time to tell it hear in hopes of finding anyone who may have had a similar experience or give me some kind of information between the relationship between psychedelic mushrooms and contact with extraterrestrial life.

It was a cold winter night, the sky was completely clear here in Washington, clear enough to see distant faint stars, and the grass was frosty. The green grass stood stiffly frosted, but no snow covered the ground. My girlfriend, I and friend had just bought some cyanecen mushrooms, native to the pacific northwest, and decided to take them in my families, small cabin here on the outskirts of town. Before we had even gotten back, my friend R had gotten impatient and took his mushrooms before any of us. By the time we were upstairs, he was already laughing and enjoying his trip. Me and my girlfriend S took ours and we waiting for the effects to kick in. The mushrooms seemed to taking effect, nothing that intense. Me and S decided to go out onto the front porch to smoke cigarettes and talk. We walked outside, mostly just feeling the euphoric body high from the shrooms, smoking cigarettes and having semi-deep discussions about life. I was standing up, facing S who was sitting on the porch steps facing me. She was speaking to me when suddenly, and quite abruptly, she stops mid sentence and looks out towards the valley in utter shock. I remember this moment very clearly and even given our state of mind, her reaction didn't seem to be fitting. I look at her for about 1-3 seconds and turn to my rear-left to match her gaze. The second I looked out from the porch and onto the lawn... *crunch*, *crunch*....... *cccrunch*. The elongated-foot-sounding steps did not sound like any animal hoof or short-toed deer. It sounded human. And based on the sound of the steps, whatever was there had stopped right at the shadow line created by the porchlight, and casted by a large stump that stood right outside the deck. I knew at that instant that me and S both heard what was there, and without speaking a word to each other, we paused for 3 seconds and immediately ran inside the front sliding door. We were both in a fearful panic.

After we had ran back upstairs and told my friend what had happened, I asked her what she saw when she had stopped speaking seconds before we heard the footsteps. She explained that the entire sky had lit up white like a bolt of lightning, but there wasn't a cloud in sight and it didn't even make a sound. The timing of these two anomalies happening within seconds of each other draws no other conclusion, other than them being immediately connected. And the fact that we both heard the crystal-clear sounds of something only taking three steps, then stopping right before us means it could not have been walking across the lawn the whole time. Whatever it was started just a few feet away, seemingly from thin air. I wonder if whatever this being was, if it was interested in our choice to take psychedelics and maybe we were giving off some sort of frequency that attracted it there for observation. To completely discredit any relationship be tween psychedelics and contact seems arrogant to me.

I hope someone believes me and can offer any information or explanation relating to this incident, This happened about 7 years ago in my senior year in high school."
509,Dream?!,Abductions,6,"A few nights ago I had a ""dream"" where myself and a group of people were camping out in the woods. We were all hangin out around a fire pit just havin a good time when we started seeing these extremely bright lights pass over head. 

I remember being terrified. Me and a couple others went and hid in a vehicle, and I could see a light appear in front of us, it created a hill and turned a spotlight on us. 

The sheer terror I could feel was so real. I ducked my head down below the dashboard, but it was too late.

A being that looked like a cross between a power ranger and Optimus prime appeared in the drivers seat next to me and he was holding a ""vaccination gun"".

I remember asking ""what is this for?""

And he replied ""it's for your DNA""

To which I replied ""is it good for my DNA or bad for it?""

And he said ""we shall see"" and promptly ""shot"" my left shoulder with the vaccine.

I had a false awakening in this dream where I woke up and was recapping the events from the night before and I realized that my left shoulder, where I was injected, was extremely painful.

Then I woke up for real and noticed that my left boulder gelt like I had received a painful tetanus shot.

Two days later, my 8 year old son told me that he was abducted. "

516,I'm afraid my family may be being targeted for abductions,Abductions,3,"So, here's the situation. I live in southeastern Oklahoma and some strange things have been occurring. What prompted me to make this post was the most recent events, both of which happened on the street I live on. 

The night before last my brother and I were driving home after running to Walmart at about 1 AM (he works nights so this is really the only time I ever see him). While I was driving up the street to our house, we live about in the middle of the street, we saw something that we at first thought was a shooting star fly above our car. I didn't think anything of it until tonight, when I saw something similar. The one from the night before last was incredibly bright and close to my car, and lit up the entire interior of my car, didn't have a tail like a shooting star should, and moved steadily over my car until it disappeared seconds after. The incident tonight involved an orb that flew over my car, but didn't shoot by. It just steadily moved over my car, but didn't disappear, just kept moving to the horizon until I couldn't see it anymore. I ran inside and made sure everyone was inside and in bed. Once again this orb didn't have a tail and didn't behave like a shooting star. Both were far to low to be a plane, and there was no bad weather to obscure my view. 

We also have a new dog, that loses her mind at about 2 AM even night. Luckily I know her past owner and asked if she'd always done that. They told me that they'd never even heard her growl. I don't know what's going on but I'd like other people's opinions and input. Also if you know of anyways that I could protect my house and my family I would appreciate it. 

P.S. There is also many strange occurrences from my childhood that you may be interested in, if so just let me know.

519,20 years later...Anyone else have a similar experience?,Abductions,0,"I've always wanted to share this experience with people, but never had a venue in which to share it.  Please let me know if anyone has had a similar incident occur.

I initially wondered if it was a dream, but it was more detailed and stuck with me unlike any other dream has in my life, therefore I concluded it really happened.

I was roughly 10 years old, I had fallen asleeep for the night.  I woke up in the middle of the night and felt like something was off.  I had a glowing half spherical moon attached to my ceiling.  However, when I looked at it, it was no longer the shape of a moon, but a glowing green blob. 

 After seeing this, and feeling like something was not right I looked outside.  I still remember this part like it was yesterday.  Upon looking out my backyard I instantly noticed that there were 2 moons in the night's sky!  They looked like our normal moon but there were definitely 2!

After exploring more and not finding anything else off, I went back to sleep.  Since then I've concluded that I somehow got abducted, and put into an environment that closely resembled my actual room at the house.

Please let me know if you've had a similar experience!"

I couldnt have been older than 5 or 6. Im floating toward the ceiling. Theres a someone or something with me. I know i wasnt asleep. I recall almost every detail but what the being looked like. I wasnt afraid, i was calm. Thats all i remember. Following that my whole life Ive felt a little different. Ive always felt a strong sense of purpose, even if i dont know what that purpose is. Ive considered an out of body experience but i have a gut feeling thats just not it.  Ive had sleep paralysis before and i know thats not it either. Ive asked my mom about my memory and she said had the same experience more than once in her life. Whats drawn me the possibility of abduction is that out of boredom Ive been watching ufo related tv shows while i work. At first it was just entertainment until i learned about abductions. The more i learn, the more possible it seems. Can anyone help me rule out  normal phenomena before i potentially waste time and money on hypnotherapy?"

A [women](https://youtu.be/dgwTAXJA2uA?t=1747) was being haunted by glowing orbs and lights. After she yelled at it to show itself, a shoulder, neck, and bald head appeared. Everyone in the room apparently saw it and the lights were caught on camera.

-




It feels like it's impossible nowadays to make a video on YouTube about Aliens without getting a comment saying ""Aliens are Demons, bro!"" 




-



And while the ""Alien = Demon"" theory as been getting more and more popular over the years, I see little to know counter arguments to this theory. 



-


I wish someone would try and defend the alimentary of aliens as actual aliens. 


-



With the constant arguing between what is true or false in the Ufology community, it's astonishing that no one ever talks about the Demon theory except for those preaching it. 


-


To my understanding, the narrative that several Christians are pushing is that ""Demons are pretending to be Aliens in order to trick people into believing in Aliens, so as to lose faith in the Bible? Also, Illuminate""




-



If I accept that Aliens are demons, I guess I also have to accept all the other nonsensical things that the Bible says, such as the Earth existing with plants and vegetation 3 days before the Sun and every other star in the universe were created, let alone the entire universe being made in 7 days, and that an entire species population can be formed through just two of members of said animal / human species, that the earth is only 6 to 7 thousand years old, that mating lambs in front of branches help determine the spots on their fur, and that 90% of everyone that has ever lived is currently burning in fire for all eternity?

Anyways, I was hoping someone has a counterargument to the ""Alien = Demon theory."" I would be very interesting in reading some.  "
526,A beam of light came down from my ceiling.,Abductions,4,"I was watching t his video, and it reminded me of something that happened to me years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCR7cwip37U
I was in this light, and so was my sister. This was sometime around 1997 or 1998, I lived in the 3rd floor of a 4 floor apartment building. Me my sister and my cousin were playing Mario Kart 64. A beam of light (very similar to the ones in this video) beamed down from the ceiling onto my sister for a few seconds. This light was so white, I couldn't see my sister in it. Only whatever limbs that were sticking out of the light. Inside of the light she looked like a shadow almost. The light then moved on to me. I remember I couldn't see myself in the light, and could barely see Mario's cap in the game. I remember I was pressing the L & R buttons to make him bounce to spot him. The light then went around my cousin and stood by the doorway. I have to say I have never seen any light as beautiful as this one. It was the purist white I have ever seen to this day. The edges of the light was blue. I came from a religious family. We all thought god had come and we were left behind. We all got on our knees and prayed.
So, I was in the light, and as far as I know, nothing happened to me. Also, considering how bright that light was, it didn't hurt my eyes.

529,"when a stone cold rational atheist, computer scientist posts to /r/abductions.",Abductions,19,"Ok, I like to think I'm a rational intellectual, someone who would never be writing something like this. Well, here it goes.

Two weeks ago I woke up with this feeling of drowsy brain fog, and two strange dots on my arm and neck. I didn't think much of it (just assumed it was acne). The night before is a hazy memory to me now, but I live in a studio apartment and have had this uneasy feeling I wasn't alone in the apartment the last couple nights. A few nights ago, I got home late from work, and I swear as I was putting my key in the door I could've sworn I heard tiny footsteps running away from the door. My apartment isn't big, its not like there was anywhere to hide if something was in there.

Anyhow, the next two weeks I had these really strange nosebleeds at work (I'm a software engineer). They would come on suddenly and it was a lot of blood, then stop. I got nervous so I went and saw a doctor but they said it was just allergies and dry air. This sort of thing never happens to me.

Abduction didn't cross my mind until Friday, when I had this vivid, terrifying dream of being abducted. It was a preying mantis-type grey alien, and the surroundings were different- I was a child (like 6) in my parents' old house. First it captured me, then I broke free and went to protect my brother. It moved crazy fast... like a Bugs Bunny cartoon almost, it tried to take my brother, but (we played baseball at the time), I grabbed a bat and started swinging but froze. You know when Professor X freezes people with his mind? It was like that. Then I woke up in a cold sweat. I realized when I had the odd sensation waking up a few weeks before, a drafting ruler (about the size of a bat, I used it for artwork years ago) was near my bed.

Other things were very weird the last two weeks. I've felt this insane amount of empathy... I was always sternly focused on work, but I just bought a roll of $1 coins and I'm wrapping them in these fly fishing dove feathers I have to give the homeless folks I see walking to work everyday. I just want them to have some hope. It's an excruciating empathy, like I can feel their pain, I want to cry when I walk past them. 

Folks, a few weeks ago I was basically living a husk of Don Draper's life- dark, cold, professional. I started creating artwork again, something I havent done in years (I have a near photographic memory and can draw masterworks from memory, but I've let that go by the wayside for the last year as I focused on work). 

This last part is the craziest one. I can't tell, but I swear to god I heard my coworker's thoughts. He was talking, and as we were walking to lunch, I heard, clearly in my head ""this guy doesn't listen to me."" In his voice. His lips weren't moving (it's true, too... I thought the guy was kind of dumb, as of two weeks ago). When we sat down for lunch, and started eating, I started to really try to listen, and later on mentioned that I was listening to him. He gave me the oddest look.

I don't know what the hell is going on, but I don't really want to regress or anything. Why wake a nightmare. I feel pain in strange places when I try to think about it (a metallic feeling in my belly button, tinnitus in my head, a throbbing sensation in the base of my skull). I don't know what these creatures would want with me. It's not wish fulfillment or wanting to be special- I don't want that- but I was an oddly sharp kid growing up, learned how to read when I was ridiculously young (18 months). I went on to study AI and now build AI simulacra in the CS field. But my drug-addicted distant cousin also claims ""aliens"", so I can't yield any causality to my circumstances. 

Whatever they did, if it really was a ""they,"" I think it was ultimately for the better (after the nosebleeds and mental fog subsided). My work anxiety is gone. I'm creating artwork, helping others. I genuinely feel more connected. Maybe they are simply here to help us."

Christian S. is an experiencer from Alabama America. Christian is one of the most sceptical experiencers I have spoken with. This means Christian has not jumped to any conclusions and has thought at great lengths about his experiences trying to make sense of them. The topic of alien abduction is extremely difficult for people to come out and speak about. This was one of the only times Christian has spoken to anyone about this topic, let alone a stranger conducting an interview."

532,Correlation between depression/anxiety and abductions,Abductions,2,"A therapist I used to see who was very open to the idea of alien abductions lead me to realize that many people who claim to have been abducted or have had paranormal experiences also have depression, anxiety or both.

I have suffered from anxiety and depression for 10 years now and never thought about them being related to my paranormal experiences until I started reading other peoples stories. For the past 10 years I had thought that these experiences were most likely the result of my mental illness, but what if my mental illness was a result of these experiences? 

There is a Ted Talk called ""Psychosis or Spiritual Awakening"" by Phil Borges who suggests that maybe, if trained properly, people with psychosis can actually see/sense more than the average human. That maybe they are more spiritually awake than others.

There are also many theories and studies that show people with depression scoring higher on realism tests. Meaning that they are less ignorant about that world than people who don't have depression, ""ignorance is bliss"". 

I am in no way saying that people who need medication should go off of it, that is a very dangerous idea. I just cant help but wonder if there are aliens/spirits are some people more sensitive and aware of them than others? 

Are we depressed because deep down we know more than we should? Or are our minds making up stories because we are depressed with our reality?  "

534,"""Glow worm"" type things at night, has anyone else had a similar experience?",Abductions,4,"I think I've only told two close friends about this and gotten the ""you're crazy"" look. When I was about 5 years old my family had a house surrounded by woods, I had recurring nightmares and insisted on either sleeping with the lights on all night or in my mother's bed. The nights I slept beside my mom in her room I would wake up to see the room crawling silently with what is best described as glow worms. They were more like caterpillars that glowed brightly, the room would be filled with maybe 15-25 of them at a time. 

The thing is I never felt scared or even thought it odd until the next day when I would wake up. One of the days I was thinking about trying to touch one to maybe try and figure out what they were, I even went to sleep in my mom's room with a pipe cleaner to poke one with. I remember seeing them multiple times after having the pipe cleaner but for some reason every time I saw them I would forget to try to get close to them. 

I think this happened for about a year before stopping, I never told my parents and tried to rule out possibilities as an adult.

539,Possible Abduction During REM Sleep? Personal Account,Abductions,8,"So I was recently telling a good friend about a VERY vivid dream I had and was wondering if it could possibly be an abduction, and if not from an extraterrestrial perhaps being from another dimension.

A bit of history, I'm 25, have a history of vivid dreams since childhood and used to, when I was younger (but the ability slowly waned) was very intuitive and had a better ability to sense things of a paranormal nature.

So basically in the ""dream"", I was in some sort of craft or room, where all the walls and windows were completely transparent and I saw a vast expanse of space, with mostly teal, blue, black and white stars, galaxies and other ""space stuff"" I'm not an expert on astronomy. 

The ""beings"" looked like us but wore doctor/nurse like uniforms and I was on something like a dentist's chair, where they went into my nasal cavity and pulled out a live locust. 

I would have written this off as just another dream, but what was so strange was that I could FEEL pain and irritation as well as the sensation on the insect being extracted. It was unlike any other physical sensation I've had in a dream, because I have NEVER felt anything being pulled OUT of my body. 

So yeah, I'd really appreciate any input, resources, links, etc. 

Thanks"

543,Missing 5 1/2 hours.,Abductions,6,"Was sharing the story with someone earlier and thought I'd share it here. 
Not a terrible lot to tell but I'll let the facts speak.

Background: 
Me and best friend traveled to/from Baton Rouge once a week, if not more, for 2+ years. Drive took 2 1/2 hours normally but if doing the speed limit maximum of 3 hours.
http://imgur.com/a/feCO6

When I was 17 (13 years ago) me and a buddy were in Baton Rouge visiting his father. They got into a fight (punches thrown) and we called his grandmother, who he lived with, saying we were on our way home (as we were pulling out of the drive way of his dads). 

It was 10:30, so we told her we would be home at roughly 1:30am. I was to make sure he did the speed limit since his adrenaline was pumping and he might be hurt. She said that's fine, she would wait up for us so she could look at his hand (that he broke the pinky on, she was a nurse) and fix it up.

A little over the halfway point, we turned off the Interstate to the main road to get back to our town. 
This stretch of road has very few turn offs and is about 20 miles long (Maybe 5-6 turn offs, it's just a long back road that people use to get to the interstate).

I really needed to use the restroom so we pulled off on the shoulder of the road and I got out to urinate.
While urinating there was a car that came over the hill. 

Looking back, this is where we believe the abduction happened. We don't remember the car ever passing us (and people who have did this kind of thing know when you are urinating on the shoulder of the road, you are very aware of cars coming/going).

We think nothing of it, as it doesn't register with us and continue driving. 

When we get to his grandmothers she comes out and ask what happened she was worried about us, why didn't we answer her phone calls or call her.

This is where we start thinking something is off and realize that it's daylight and is after 7 in the morning.


So the **tl;dr**:

A 3 hour drive took us 8 1/2 hours. 

We don't remember a car passing us when we should have.

5 1/2 hours of our lives are missing.

We would of thought nothing of it had his grandmother not pointed out the time we left and what time it was when we got there.

Edit: Formating and grammar."
544,Buddha GrandMaster Talks About Aliens,Abductions,2,"Hi All,

I have some lecture excerpts that you might be interested in. It's from a Buddha Master from the Falun Dafa school of QiGong. A very high level cultivation technique that is very righteous and powerful:

http://www.falundafa.org

I recommend checking this out, especially the book 'Zhuan Falun':

https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/pdf/ZFL2014.pdf

Wow what a read, it covers so many things, from the mysteries of the microcosm to the macrocosm, other dimensions, the soul, ancient prehistory, supernatural latent abilities, chi, gong energy and so many other things.

This practice is also being severely persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party with practitioners being sent to concentration camps, tortured, there organs sold on the black market and often killed:

http://en.minghui.org/cc/1/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvAOOwvJMZs

In these following lecture excerpts, the founder of Falun Dafa, Mr Li Hongzhi spells out the Alien Agenda that is upon this earth and it's implications to humanity as a whole.
The rest of the lectures that have been given around the world can be found here:

http://www.falundafa.org/eng/books.html

Also Mr Li Hongzhi has been interviewed by Time Asia, another fascinating read:

But in closing, here are the lecture excerpts on the Alien Agenda that is taking place on our planet, I hope you will find them of interest.

Quote:

“Let me first explain what alien beings are all about. You know that this Earth isn’t the only planet with life in this universe, and Earth hasn’t existed just this once. I’m saying that at Earth’s position there were Earths that existed before. Those previous Earths were discarded. Some exploded. It happened many times—the number has been quite large. The final stage of an Earth has always been a time when its lives were the most corrupt and its matter was the most impure, so the Earth could no longer be kept. It would be eliminated since the whole sphere had turned into a ball of karma.

The reason is, lives reincarnate . They reincarnate into soil, rocks, plants or matter, and regardless of what they are reborn as, they carry karma with them . Earth would become a ball of karma when karma was all over the place, so at that point it would be eliminated. There would still be some people on Earth who were relatively good, and those exceptionally few or extremely few ones were taken and placed onto another planet within the Three Realms.

Yet through the ages this Earth has been replaced innumerable times and each time there were people who remained. So over time those remaining lives increased in number. The gods in each time period created humans with a different appearance, so the differences are quite substantial, and there are some who were created on other planets. These are alien beings. They’ve become like a record of history , placed there like a page of history left behind . That’s the function they serve, a minor one. They were left behind from the final stage of Earth during those times, and took with them the technology they had in those times over to other planets, so their starting point was more advanced.

Over this long period of time, the knowledge of the universe they came to grasp far exceeds that of the inhabitants of today’s Earth. Their bodies can enter other dimensions and adjust to the mode of those dimensions they are in; they’ve developed to this stage. Those things they ride in that fly back and forth—those aircraft that human beings call flying saucers—can enter other dimensions and fly into other space-times. If they travel in a fast space-time, after being there for just a short while they traverse a long distance. So that speed is inconceivable to human beings. The types of fuel they use aren’t in the least the kinds of substances conceivable by the technology, theories, or concepts of modern science.

Over the ages, these alien beings have continually been developing and metamorphosing. So in this universe there have really appeared the abnormal social relations that these kinds of lives have. Greed and lust have caused something like star wars to actually happen over where they live. They haven’t yet threatened humankind because humankind doesn’t have the ability to pose a threat to them . So they haven’t attacked humankind.

They would attack humankind if you were to threaten them. Although alien beings haven’t attacked humankind, they know that a human body is the most perfect. They’ve thus taken a fancy to the human body and want to steal it. They saturate all domains of humankind with science to make human beings firmly believe in science and rely on it. When human beings ’ thoughts and way of existence are completely assimilated to theirs, they just have to replace people’s souls and humans will become them, and they will eventually replace the human race.

It’s a long story. They have been coming here full-scale since the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution in the West. They had come prior to that time, but they didn’t control people then. Their full-scale arrival began when Caucasian society entered the industrial age. They made full preparations and systematic arrangements for occupying this earth. It was they who created science for human beings .

So this science was set up by aliens. Their purpose was to unify human beings and simplify their thoughts to the point of being as uniform as machines. And they unified knowledge to make it easy for them to later on control and replace human beings. Furthermore, they’ve chosen a few nationalities as the vanguards of their future, total control of humankind. Japan is the vanguard that drives technology.

The United States is the vanguard in breaking away from all ancient cultures on earth. The cultures of even the most ancient and closed-off nations haven’t been able to escape. The whole world is being impacted by America’s modern culture. England was the vanguard in the manufacture of machinery during the early stages , and Spain was the vanguard for mixing the human races.

The way alien beings get human beings to shake free of the gods is to mix the races, causing human beings to become rootless people, just like the plant hybrids people make nowadays. South Americans, Central Americans, Mexicans and some people in South East Asia— all of these races have been mixed. None of this can evade the gods’ eyes. Alien beings have made rather extensive preparations for overtaking human beings.

Everyone who knows how to operate a computer has been registered. Of course, our students don’t have this problem. Once you obtain the Fa, I clean up that layer of your body that’s been occupied by them. They have formed a layer of their body within the human body.

It’s incredibly frightening! Everything people learn from elementary school right up through college is the science they brought , and everything that human beings use nowadays is the product of this omnipresent science. Why do the inspirations people get make computers and technology develop with such tremendous speed? It’s done by that layer of the body that alien beings formed so as to control the human race. It’s exactly because that system of their technology and science that has formed in the human body is making people’s minds do so.

Today it’s incredible how developed computers are. But it is not a human technology. Man will be replaced by alien beings if it continues like this for long. But think about it, everyone: Alien beings are, after all, beings within the Three Realms, where ordinary humans are. There are other reasons why they dare to do this sort of thing. It has happened because the Fa of the universe has deviated and gods no longer look after things.

So it has to do with high-level beings as well. If this situation is to be turned around, it has to begin from high levels. That’s because they have this idea that human beings are no longer any good, their morality has degenerated, and everything is perverted. So they think it’s all right to just replace them , given that they are going to be eliminated all the same. They have to pay for all of the bad things they’ve done, for sure. The principles of this universe are absolutely reasonable toward any life.

So they have to answer for everything they’ve done. As for how their lives will eventually be dealt with, alien beings definitely won’t exist in the future. If there are truly good ones among the alien beings, then their lives can reincarnate as other lives. Bad lives will be eliminated. So every thing that every being does positions himself for the future . And that includes all human beings. Whatever a human being does positions him.

That’s the situation as far as alien beings go. They are being swept out up there, and they found out about the cleaning, so they scurried over here, and in particularly large numbers in recent years. As of right now, most of the alien beings who have come here did so fleeing for their lives. They knew that in the end it would be hard for them to escape, so some alien beings have married Earth dwellers. But it’s not that they marry legitimately, because no one would marry them. They catch a village woman to leave behind their offspring. And there are those who are hiding among ordinary people. They can’t stay under cover no matter how they hide. Immense gong is coming up from the microscopic level.

Whether it be steel, iron, wood, the human body, water, rocks, air, plants, animals, substances, etc., from the microscopic level of everything gong is coming up toward the surface. Tell me, where could they escape to? The gong is omnipresent and rushing up to the surface . So they’ve seen that there is no way to dodge it or to hide from it. How do they exist? They aren’t actually possessing spirits. But some of them have assumed man’s appearance and walk the streets . You have no idea who they are.

Some have hidden and don’t come out. But the number is now small, very small. In the past they could hide , and their flying saucers could fly up and go to another dimension. But the other dimensions have all been cleaned up. Immense gong is rushing here and they can no longer hide. They can only hide in a cave or at the bottom of the sea in this dimension. Even so, they can’t stay concealed. Anyway, that’s the problem they face . All lives are positioning themselves in this affair. You should know that although alien beings brought their science to human beings to achieve their goals, gods are in charge of everything and are in turn using them.”

Quote:

“Having seen many movies, having read many imaginative stories, and having been influenced by a lot of things in society, people have developed a warped mindset that indulges in fantasy. You asked how to communicate with intelligent beings. Let me tell you all that an ordinary person can’t do that sort of thing, and he lacks the ability. If you could indeed communicate with intelligent beings but weren’t a cultivator yourself and were without energy, you would be in danger. You might lose your life any moment. Besides, you would see gruesome spirits but no high-level beings, for your level would be too low and limited to only that of humans. So it would be a terrifying situation. It’s even more terrifying if you want to communicate with living beings beyond Earth.

Lives beyond Earth are just lives on other planets within this physical dimension that our human eyes can perceive. Yet those lives don’t regard people as human beings. They think people are beasts, a kind of animal. They slaughter people at will and experiment on you at will. They kidnap people to their planets, lock them in cages, and put them on display as animals. Many of Earth’s people who have gone missing were taken by them. I can also tell you that today’s human science was created by them. Why have those aliens created for humans something like the current science? It’s because what they have on their planet is akin to it.

They want to bring it to this planet and eventually replace humans. They found that the human body is really perfect, flawless. So they covet the human body and want to eventually replace humans. They have added their things into one layer of human beings’ molecular cells. That’s already been done now and it has formed on a large scale. So for me to save you today, I not only have to remove all the attachments and karma that you need to eliminate, but I also have to clean up this stuff for you. The road humankind is traveling down is dreadful. Computers would have commanded people one day. Ongoing developments have conformed to this trajectory. Humans were to become the slaves of computers and machinery, and eventually be replaced by aliens.

Why have computers developed so quickly, and why has the human brain suddenly become so “sharp”? All of this has been carried out by aliens controlling the human mind. Aliens have registered everyone who knows how to operate a computer.For real. As to our students, I’ve cleaned all of that up for them, so that they won’t be interfered with by aliens when they use computers. Why are there aliens? Some aliens originate from their planets. Why do some aliens always come to Earth? It’s because they were once humans on Earth. But it wasn’t the Earth of our time. It was the previous Earth that existed at the same location as this Earth. Earth has been replaced many times.

Each time it was replaced, there was a portion of lives—living beings created by gods with different appearances, some of whom were similar to today’s humans, some of whom had different forms who were relatively good at the time and were thus preserved. They weren’t destroyed, yet they weren’t allowed to enter the period of human development on the next Earth, either. So they were sent to another planet. That’s how it was done every time. Also, it has left a record of this universe, for they were humans on Earth in different time periods. It serves that purpose. 

But due to a slackening in overseeing them, they have developed, and they have created all kinds of scientific methods according to their schemes; some are like the kind on our earth, some assume other forms, and there are a variety of modes of development. Of course, they don’t use the term “science.”

The names they use belong to their languages and concepts. These things have deteriorated further and further. And with the deviation of the cosmos’ Great Fa, the aliens have become worse and worse too. That’s why all aliens are in the process of being completely eliminated. They are being eliminated throughout the entire universe. At present, those up there have been eliminated.  What’s left are only those who have escaped to Earth, who are mingling among people or who have attached to human bodies. And there are other types too.”

Quote:

“As you know, modern science was brought to mankind by aliens. They came when the Industrial Revolution began in the West. They started with mathematics and chemistry—started from the shallow, simple knowledge of the earliest days—and penetrated on through to modern machinery, and eventually they developed up to today’s computers. As development continues further their ultimate goal will be to replace human beings.

How is the replacement to take place? As I mentioned, in the body of today’s human beings almost everyone has a layer of the body that was created by aliens.Why do I say that? It’s because all of the science that they instilled in you has created a warped human mindset in your mind. There have never been humans like this in any of mankind’s previous civilizations. When the mind is like that, so is the body.

As you know, every cell in your body is you, and your brain is connected to the brain in every cell. In that case, the thought processes inside the countless cells in your body are all the thoughts of warped human beings, and the entire body has become like that. This ties into why gods no longer regard man as human. When mankind is no longer human, what is the point of gods’ saving it?

You know that when a person dies, he doesn’t really die. The shell of the layer of the largest molecular particles sloughs off, whereas the part of the body composed of microcosmic particles below molecules hasn’t died. It is separated, as if a person takes off a piece of clothing. It isn’t really dead. Yet the person in this dimension has vanished, since the body needs to be cremated or buried and it will eventually decompose and dissolve. It has departed from this dimension; that is, this layer of particles has disappeared.

Then, as to the alien culture that I was just talking about, it is precisely using man’s own thinking to create the bodily layer that it needs, and it is doing so without man being aware of it. How will they ultimately replace human beings, then? You know that they still have to find a way to replace the shell of the outermost surface of human beings. This is the method of “cloning” that man now wants to use. Gods look after people, and when they don’t look after someone, they won’t instill the elements of life into that person.

This is to say, the reason you are alive in this world is not that you have this flesh body, nor is it because your mother gave you this body that you are alive. It is because you have your main spirit (yuanshen) and the existence of all of your other spirits (shen) that you can live. Why doesn’t a person keep living after he dies and the body is laid down there, since it’s the same body after all? It’s because all of his main spirits have left. That is, if a person isn’t given a spirit and isn’t allowed to reincarnate at the time of birth, he will still be dead after he is born. So what will happen? Aliens will enter.

This is the ultimate means that aliens will use to replace man— that is, cloning humans. Man is being used by aliens to destroy himself, yet he is not aware of it and is still protecting this science, destroying the human race. If humans are cloned en masse in the future, those beings will all be aliens that have reincarnated in human bodies, and there will be no more human race.”

Quote:

""I’ve told you before that because of alien science and technology, one layer of the human body, one of the human body’s layers of particles, has been placed fully under the control of aliens. It consists entirely of alien planets’ elements, including numbers, mechanical structures, electronic components, and so on. It consists of that stuff. And those things are continually creating a warped effect. 

The large-scale modern industries brought about by science have impacted many low-level dimensions in the cosmos. In my Fa-rectification I’ve found that quite a large layer of the cosmos has been contaminated by those things. And those warped things have had a considerably large resisting effect in the Fa-rectification.""

545,Are there any redditors who claim to be abducted by aliens if then tell your story,Abductions,22,0
546,Hum and Light,Abductions,3,"My senior year of high school my best friend and I were at her home in Florida.  This is the part of my story where some credibility could be lost, my friend and I decided this particular day that we were going to make weed brownies.  I am not going to get into how they were made or even really focus on that.  After the brownies were done we ate a couple and then our day just disappeared.  I don't know what happened.  I just remember both of us waking up in her bed scared.  There was a bright light and a humming noise coming from outside of her window.  We were so scared, I remember her and I cuddling together and her saying, ""I will give you 20 dollars to go check on my family.""  Of course I declined.  This light was bright like someone was pulled up right next to her bedroom window and shining their car's brights into her room.  There was a hum, loud enough to be noticed- but yet no one else in her house woke up!  This is where the story gets weird.  Her bedroom window was behind tall bushes.  There was a tree almost directly in front of her window and a fence surrounding her property which was about 6 feet from the tree.  There is no possible way a vehicle could have been in her yard.  Her window and house were far enough from the road that even if a car was on the road shining it's brights in the direction of her window it could not be that dramatic.  The light and noise lasted what seemed like forever, but in reality was only several minutes.  For years, I forgot about the experience, well a better explanation is that I just didn't think about it and blamed the weed.  I lost an entire day of my life, and when i came to I was lying in a bed scared with a bright light shining into a window which wasn't feasible given the circumstances, accompanied by a humming.  If I was not abducted, my friend and I witnessed someone in her house being abducted.  What's even stranger is that, as an adult I realized I have this special ability to break electronics just by being near them or touching them.  I've always referred to myself as a ""white noise"".  After reading symptoms of abductees, I realized that it's common.  I've eaten weed brownies before and after, and nothing has ever happened to me like that before.  I'm a skeptic about the whole abduction thing, but this was unexplainable from a logical standpoint.  The fact that two of us experienced it- the same thing, one of us being a psychologist now, and the other working in journalism... just weird.  I felt like sharing my story might reach someone who had something similar happen and can share with me.

548,Possible abduction,Abductions,1,"Around 6 months ago I was sleeping at my girlfriend's house and all of a sudden I saw blinding strobe lights and then I was on a hard, cold, metal table. A light that looked kind of like a dentist light was shining down on my face. I remember feeling helpless and scared. I kept seeing these big grey beings I don't think their intention was to really harm me I think they were just observing me and my reactions to my surroundings. They seemed curious but said nothing. They ended up running a test on my brain with a worm/centipede looking thing. They let it crawl in my nose and ears. It didn't hurt at all whatsoever. Once that was done i saw the blinding strobe lights and all of the sudden I was back at my girlfriend's house and I had a major migraine and my nose was bleeding. I'm want to dismiss it as a dream but it was so real feeling."

555,"I feel crazy, help me",Abductions,7,"I've been having weird nights the last 2 nights specifically. I wake up suddenly, my vision is - fuzzy, or almost pixelated - I feel intensly that someone is on my room. Last night I woke up to a dog barking, but it didnt sound like my dog, I wasnt sure if my dog was in my bed so I checked and he was sound asleep in his bed on the floor next to ours. I felt scared, I immediatley cuddled up to my husband who seemed restless himself. I didnt see any entites, but I could feel them, it felt like a phychic encounter. Its hard to explain but what I felt was something was trying to understand my consiousness and spirtuality, what makes me human. I felt an insect like presence, not an animal or human connection, like a being with no soul. Its weird because its an encounter based on feeling, instead of seeing anything. 
I feel terrified, I wake suddenly but cant get out if bed at night.
My feet were asleep one night, and freezing even though it wasnt cold. I heard my dog walking, but he was asleep. Our house is creaky & I do laundry at night, so there are justifiable noises. 
I took a survey on this sub today and answered yes to so many things. I have noticed scratches and cuts on my hip and thigh area, and thought I scratched myself. I used to get unexplained bruises. I noticed a large bump on my inner thigh, like a bug bite, and then today its gone. My dog constantly jumps up out of sleep, totally scared, and that has only happened since we moved into this house. For awhile, he would chase a nothing, like as if a rat was running through the house, he was very playful about it, and it was super creepy, my husband thought there must be a critter under our house (there is a crawl space)  Ive gotten nose bleeds lateley and that hasnt happened since I was a kid. I feel so tired and unmotivated, have a hard time working ( i work from home) 
I constantly see repeat numbers on the clock, everytime I look at it. 
The first night, when I woke up feeling a presence, I saw light, like moving around even though I had my sleep mask on, it was like lights were inside my eyes.
I felt as though, I was in my bedroom, but it wasnt my room, like I was under a facade / halucination to protect my memory, while I was infact somewhere else.
I also get a tingling sensation on my forehead, at random times.  

I feel crazy for considering aliens, I cant tell anyone, maybe my brother - he is a  bit out there, he has always maintained that he was taken as a kid. I remember when he was 5 or 6, he wouldnt sleep in his room and said there was an ""evil ET"" my parents just thought it was normal boogey man stuff and he started sleeping with my mom. He still maintains what he saw to this day, and like I said hes a bit out there. 

My husband will think im insane. What can I do? Im really scared and sad about this. 

Disclosure, I did ayahuasca 11 days ago, could this be lingering affects? Could I have opened my Psyche to unwanted entities?"
556,Weird Dream,Abductions,3,"This happened about a year ago and a half ago. I woke up in the middle of the night with a really strange feeling. It was like something wasn't right, I got up to get w glass of water and saw I had left the kitchen light on. I figured this must have been why I felt off,  so I cut off the light, got my water and when to back to sleep. Later I woke up...well I'm not sure if I did or not, it fell real, but I just don't know. I was woken up by a vibration on the side of my head, and a loud buzzing noise. The best thing I can compare it to is when your getting your hair cut with clippers. It felt and sounded like like that but it was extremely painful. I could not fully open my eyes and within seconds fell back asleep. Then I had the most vivid dream ive ever experienced. I woke up (in my dream), and clearly remember what I had just experienced. My first logical explanation was a friend or family member had snuck into my house and cut my hair as some kinda bad prank. So I jumped up and ran to my mirror to look, their was nothing, but I could still feel pain coming from the side of my head. It was bees had stung me multiply times in the same place. I started to have a panic attack, witch is something Iver never had before. Freaking out i made my way into my living room not knowing why I was so scared. Then I saw a bright light shining throw my bay window. Then I woke up, but again it was a dream. I asked my self out loud if this was real and started searching my night stand for my phone. This is when I woke up for real. I felt completely clam apon waking. I had a really strange feeling, like being high, not anything like on drugs, just a altered state of mind if that makes sense. This felling soon went away and got up for work and moved on from that night. I'm not sure if it was all a dream or not. I forgot about it for a while till I found this sub. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

"
557,My generalized and summed up experience,Abductions,2,"I have had a number of strange circumstances and events surrounding me from time to time throughout my entire life but way more eventful during my childhood. Many of the things I tried to explain away and even forget but some were just to precise and or unique to shrug off. All kinds of things ranging from visions of the future to orbs of light with all kinds of crazy in the middle and to the side.

I really like /r/paranormal and have posted a few stories there. In fact it’s one of the few other places I have posted. My issue with the place is a feeling of people who believe they know it all and everything is a demon from the burning pits of hell. I’m sure thats not uncommon here and truthfully I respect opinions and welcome them however that is not a satisfactory answer and it leaves a lot to be desired in the topic of abductions or even aliens in general in my opinion.I don’t deny such things exist I just don’t really think everything is a demon because its mysterious. I can suck it up for possible spiritual entities but I don’t yet buy the idea that ALL aliens are demons. I think of reddit as a journal to document my experiences for people to read and or relate to as I do with theirs.

What made me want to post about this and prod the minds of others is because part of me wants to try regression. I recently read a list of 58 signs that you might have been abducted. I am not going to go over all of the signs I feel like I fit from the list but lets just say I really connected with this list (scored 41 out of 58). Some of it was unfitting but like most things in life results will vary.

http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread525151/pg1
I didn’t initially find the list here, it’s been a while and I don’t remember exactly where I found it but somebody else used the exact list here it seems.

__________
I don’t know with certainty that I have ever been taken. I can tell you however that ever since I was a little kid I knew I was much different that most kids. I was smart yet slow while being an outgoing introvert. I believed for the longest time I was mentally ill and that secretly my family didn’t want to tell me that I was suffering from some kind of mental illness like I was autistic or something. The ADHD really didn’t help me either. To this day I don’t believe I was ever tested for autism spectrum or anything like it. I did some pretty bizarre shit when I was a kid but I think that just happens in general. The good news is that for the most part I don’t feel slow anymore. In fact sometimes people just amaze me about how dumb they could be at times. Almost like when you start slower but ultimately push the faster speed.

Lets get to the good stuff. The list included but was not limited to a variety of items. you should review from the link. Some I didn’t fit because I am a male or because I am not a daddy or because they were dependent on other people.  What makes me so damn curious that I might have been abducted is because when I was little I was certain that I was. I don’t remember the details but I could tell you about them then. I told my friends about it. I guess thats why I didn’t have many. I wasn’t being fed this shit from any family or friends honestly and the only TV I watched was weekend cartoons and NES games. I also am “O-“ and I just found out that is significant. Also throughout my life I have heard and seen things in my room and outside my window “be they spiritual in nature or beings of sorts or UFOs”. I have woken up to scrapes and scares that took a week or two to go away and one I can never forget and will post an illustration of ranging from blue to orange in color and often with a raised puffy nature but never painful at all. Sometimes they would be in locations I cannot reach with my own hands or appear under clothing that I would have needed to be taken off.

The last scar I ever got was puffy like raised skin in the shape of a face almost. It was like a rough simple cartoon of an alien head. It was the most bizarre one I ever got. I was 18 when it happened living in my birth city of Redding Ca. I actually took a picture with my 1MP digital camera (WOOOOT!) But I lost it years ago along with some other pictures I will always miss that cannot be replaced.

I slept in my underwear that night. I had a belt but it was hanging in my closet and I did’t need it much those days unless for looks in most cases. When I woke up the scar was on my right hip area. I immediately went to the kitchen to get coffee and my mother was up doing the same. She thought it was weird but that it had to be from my belt. She does not believe in anything odd or supernatural (everything is a demon or angel with her). The scar was not at all painful but it was raised pretty high. it was red like in nature and lasted for about 3 weeks. This was one of the last ones I ever got and or remember.

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54906720/The%20Mark.png
This is the image i roughly illustrated. It’s very accurate but not perfect. It gets the point across but the actual scar was more on point to my description. It was about 1-1.5 inches in vertically on my hip. To be clear there was a thing to be seen in my room that fit this design and like I said it was raised skin and not an impression. Also remember it did not hurt but it lasted for weeks on end. It somewhat reminds me of something like a weird wall socket cable end. I have awoken to a few dots in triangle formation as well as square ones. Often those ones were not raised but just discolored and again temp.
__________

I have experienced what is scientifically called Sleep paralysis while I did I witnessed and heard creatures present. I was and sometimes still am terrified of stupid shit that should not startle someone. I was woken up in various odd places in my house or even in the wrong house (grandmas). I have seen many a sightings too and shared some of those sightings with others at the time I saw them. Used to sleepwalk and have night terrors galore. I often still talk in my sleep but I don’t think these last things are too too nuts. I have and sometimes still do dream of being around aliens or crafts. I sometimes dream I can fly. But it used to terrify me because something would make it awful like loosing control mid flight or falling to my death. I used to do in all my dreams as a child if not something very terrible happen instead.

I am curious if anyone in my position would look into regression or if you believe the therapy is bogus. Also if you think it’s crap I am curious if you think you know of something better and more effective. Also flat out generalized commends and answers are welcomed. I am open to ideas and answers whatever you think they might be (even if you think they are demons). I need to know if there are people in my position that have done it and ultimately feel it was worth it. I cannot remember being abducted and as a child kids say all kinds of crazy shit.

Hope I don't sound too far out there."

Ok so I had this dream about a year ago and I was recently reminded by time hop about it and it's one of those dreams that you remember very clearly. So here's what I remember: I was in my apartment alone (which was strange because I have a big family living here) and I felt an uneasy tension I was walking towards my kitchen and I saw through the outside window nothing but an orange sky like if there was a fire near by. Fast forward a bit and I hear something coming towards my front door and in my dream I have never felt the sensation of me stepping on something but I felt the cold touch of my tile floor in the kitchen and I backed myself into a corner to grab my knife and when what ever was coming close to my door ran off I have never felt nervous or scared for my life before in a dream and I remember waking up being skeptical if this was real life or not. Another weird thing is my friend had a similar dream the same night so it scared me even more. 

What do you guys think though?

tl;dr I had a dream I almost got abducted but it felt to real to be a dream and a friend of mine had a similar dream that added to be being skeptical if this was real life or not "

564,Abducted?,Abductions,6,"HI people of reddit, I have an “abduction” story. Now its important to say that I’ve never seen an alien or anything for that matter. But I have experienced some really weird shit. Okay here it goes back in the mid 90’s I live in a small town near Mexico city where it really wasn't as populated as it is now in days but my story starts one day that I got back home and went to sleep and after a couple of seconds after closing my eyes I felt stiff the best way that I can describe it as would be as if stiff as a board because I couldn't move anything the only thing I could do was breath and move my eyes. But I could only see in black in white  I couldn't see anything in color and I could also hear i the back something I could best describe as glass breaking or bottles been moved around immediately followed by me been levitated I could i actually see the selling getting closer to me but I always got so scared that would shut my eyes and i could see trough my shut eye a big bright light and that is it, I would wake up the very next day with a horrible pain in my stomach I would wake up gasping for air as if a mule had kicked me in the gut. Where this shit gets scary as fuck is that one day my neighbor asked me If I was doing work on my roof because he would see bright lights coming out of my roof i just answered him… no dude no, you must have been tripping because I didn't see shit and played it off as if everything was cool but deep inside of my i was shitting my self and i wanted to run home and hug my mom! But wtf was i going to tell her? that some weird shit was happening? no! So i just kept it to my self and sucked up. This continued to happen to me off and on for a couple of years. it hasn't happened to me lately, I can say that one the scariest things is the levitating part that shit feels is the scariest feeling I have ever felt."

567,Personal - Has anyone else seen the blue room?,Abductions,8,"I don't talk about this a lot, but I have been thinking lately and I want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience, so I made this account to scope things out I guess. 

I should start by saying that my earliest memory is from when I was around 18 months old. I would try to climb out of my crib and take off my onesie, as a lot of little kids do. I remember everything very clearly. My mom pinned my PJs on with a turtle safety pin that I could never get off because it was too strong. This isn't relevant to the supposed encounters, but I feel like it's worth mentioning since I hear most peoples' earliest memories are from when they were three or four, not one and a half. 
At around two or three, I would often ask my parents where my ""other parents"" were. I seem to remember saying something like, ""They look just like you but they're not you"" or something. My dad thought I had lived a past life (he's buddhist or something), and he was pretty pumped about that. (I do have memories from a ""past life,"" but I don't remember my ""parents."")
When I was four or five, some really weird things started to happen to me. I would be in bed and I would see my parents holding hands, walking into my room at night, and they'd look over my bed, then smile at each other as if they were admiring me, like I was some great success, and then I would blink and they would be gone, or I would just black out or something. My parents didn't really ever hold hands, like, ever. 
Maybe that's what I meant when I was referring to my other parents. Maybe I saw them when I was really, really little, too. Getting shivers thinking about it. (Now that I'm thinking about it, I seem to remember it happening from very early on, but I can't remember anything clearly.)
Other nights, I would get into bed, then I would blink and it would suddenly be 
morning. I wouldn't feel as if I had slept, either. I wasn't exhausted, but I just felt like no time had passed at all. 
I would also see lights outside my window, but I lived in the middle of the woods. I don't know if this is a memory from when I lived in the suburbs and there was an antenna just outside my house, but it sure felt like it happened while I was in the woods. 

Here's the bit that had me realizing it might be extraterrestrial related. 
Some nights I would have dreams in the thirdperson perspective about being abducted by aliens, and I remember distinctly what my location looked like. It was a cylindrical blue room about the size of a classroom with spotlights all around the floor, pointed at me. The floor was firm but spongy in texture, like gym pads. The light diffusion in the room was strange and almost didn't make sense to me. 
When I was in the room, I almost always had on my pajamas. I was wearing my little pink fleece nightgown with baby harp seals printed all over it, or my faux silk one with little pinkish roses all over it. Other lights would flash on. I felt like I was being watched by more than one person, or being. I would look around and see nobody, and then the floor would open up abruptly and I would fall back down. It was like I was watching it from over a camera, a fixed point in a room. I think in some of my dreams I would start to walk around, but then I would fall anyway. 
Being dropped down always gave me the sense that I was being examined to see if I was ""ready."" Like I was supposed to be preparing for something, and the last time they set me down they decided I wasn't ""ready"" yet, or that I was ineligible. 

I intuitively knew a lot of things that normally kids my age didn't know, and I had no explanation for how I knew them. Most prominently, I what periods were. I knew about a few of the US presidents when I was only in the beginning of my kindergarten years. I was easily upset by other peoples' suffering and still have a crazy sense of empathy. As I got older and family problems began to happen, I had this disturbingly clear image of the bigger picture in my mind... how the world would be if humans weren't so petty, if we didn't fight over every little insignificant thing. At eight years old, I became aware of how small my existence was in the universe, and how I wanted to make a difference. I wanted everything to be better, and I wanted to make people stop fighting. My parents, my relatives, my friends... everyone. I wanted the fighting to stop. I still do. 
I've always had trouble telling people what I think about this ""bigger picture"" and how so many things are insignificant to the world, but still everything is important, and how everything is supposed to add up to something. 
I include this because I've heard that people who have abduction stories talk about warnings from their abductors. I haven't gotten any warnings, but I feel like I'm supposed to be a guardian. I feel like I'm meant to help people, help this planet. It's a very scary feeling. 

Only in recent years have I actually thought anything of these occurrences when I started looking into alien abduction stories. Stories about weird dreams and lost hours in particular. My visions of my parents make me wonder how aliens would approach children without alarming them. I was always bothered by words like ""brain"" and ""mind,"" as if there was something I was supposed to be hiding, and after I turned seven, I hated to talk about the ""past life"" I had.  

I stopped having these sorts of occurrences and dreams happen to me when I entered school and began worrying about social things. When I was 14, I started taking antidepressants, and almost everything relative to this diminished because I was worrying about other things. But now I'm trying to get off of them, and it's like things are coming back and making sense with each dose lower I go. 

I blamed my overactive imagination for all this. That could be all this is; just me overthinking everything I saw, since I did have some hallucinations at that age. 

But I feel like I need to know if any of you have felt this, experienced these things.  

I may be leaving things out because I haven't thought about so much of this in such a long time, but I'll update with whatever I remember at whatever time. I'll try and make sketches and upload them someplace or another.  

Does anyone else have similar experiences to this? I really would like to know. 

Thanks for reading.

568,[Personal] Alien hand print left on window,Abductions,7,"I'd like to start this post with some much needed UFO history/backstory:

- I've had intense phobia of standard alien images since early ages of 5 (first time I saw E.T.) I can look at pictures of the Alien franchise xenomorphs no problem, but the more Grey-like and spindly they are, I physically feel sick just looking at. That Communion book cover is terrifying. 

- I used to have sleeping problems with 2 recurring nightmares of seeing a UFO in the sky outside my room at parent's house. I'd then rush downstairs to check the conservatory is locked (it is not) and when I go to grab the handle and lock it, I see a very long-fingered Grey hand grasp the handle. I always wake up then. The second dream was just literally me being in a room with a thick set about 6-7 foot fall Grey, and a RIDICULOUSLY long limbed spindly grey that takes up the whole room, it's head craning down over the shoulder of the other one. It was impossible to look away from, not matter how hard I tried.

- I took sleep therapies, and eventually learnt a few life-saving lucid dream hacks so I could change the dream/wake myself up as soon as I noticed the recurring features beginning to manifest.

- When I came to tell parents about the sleep problems, Mum revealed that she'd seen something similar. She swears down that a week after my early birth, she checked on me every hour during the night that I was still alive. One night I'd been particularly bad, she came in and swears down that she saw 'a wingless angel' who took up the whole room, standing over my bed, bent double. She stared at its face and remembers nothing else but an androgynous face she cannot even draw. She said without moving its lips, somehow it told her everything was fine and that she could go back to sleep. She did. She thought it was an angel back then, but now she's not so sure.

- Alien nightmares hadn't bothered me since 2009 but in November 2013 that changed.

Nov 2013 - My Student flat (not family home) 

I wake up from a nightmare in which aliens were trying to get into the house I was living in with 5 other girls. The first thing I did was check my door - I had a safety go lock on it all the time, especially when I slept. It hadn't moved.
It was about 6am and I didn't have class till 12 so I listened to my ipod till I could sleep again.

When I woke again from my actual alarm at 9, I go to open the curtains, and [find this on the window](http://i.imgur.com/fvgsq9N.jpg)

I remember staring at it for a good few minutes  feeling sick. I have no long nails and never will because I'm gross and bite them. The shape was so distinct and the nail so clear it weirded me out.

I woke up the three other housemates still at home. They honestly did not know what to make of it.TBH I think one girl finally clocked why I had immediately turned down the downstairs patio-door bedroom when we'd assigned rooms (too many conservatory flashbacks there).

To double check that it hadn't been us or whatever for my piece of mind really, I had us all attempt to recreate the hand print.
http://i.imgur.com/Lu85w2M.jpg

The original print is just to the right of the butterfly window charm.

Wondered if anyone else has experienced something like this before? To this day everyone kind of just brushes it off with 'wow that is bizarre' but it honestly scares me - the idea that something could have been in my locked room right next to me and done that. Also wondering if it has anything to do with the thing my mother saw or whether she was just sleep deprived, but either way Dad backed up her claim that she'd told him at the time.

No idea why an alien would fly x amount of distance to come leave a weird shape on my window, but maybe I'd rather not know.

569,What Does An Alien Abduction Look Like?,Abductions,0,0
570,abduction in South eastern New Hampshire,Abductions,1,"This is my story on how I was abducted possibly. I am not for sure what happened but this is the only thing I could think of that would make sense so I decided to put it on here and hear what other people have to say. 

     I live in a very small town in New Hampshire USA. Near Dover (If you wear that is and if you don't a reference point). I own an ATV and ride it every now and again. Sometimes with my friends. In my mind this is where it all started. I was with my friends Zack and Deacon at a race way in that area the next town over. Very small lots of country folk like myself. You know the type carhartt working pants bright orange shirt that is one size to big and Chippewa boots. We were up in the VIP box cause my friends dad works for Pepsi which is a sponsor and we are standing out on the wooden balcony. We are a light just hovering in the distance and it goes back and fourth and just keeps going up and down. At one point it disappears then reappears. We thought that was weird so we ignored it. We waited for fireworks to start and right as they did it vanished and never returned. I the next day me and my other friend Cam where riding out ATVs all day in the trails that go on back of my house and lead to snowmobile trails that we are not suppose to be on. It gets late and since this is summer time it's about 9 o'clock at night and it gets dark. We rush back to our houses. I crashed me ATV the year previous and after a year of trying to put the front end back together I say screw it and don't and just get New plastics and leave it be. Because of this I don't have head lights so my friend has to be in front. When we are a mile or two from my house my ATV hear light to out. ""Shorter a fuse I said to myself"". Then I see what seem to be an aircraft of some sorts. Hexagonal is the best I could put it. It hovers above me and my friend and he zooms off as I slow down some how to a dead stop. Now I'm in the middle of the woods far away from home with no lights. The crafts let's out a beam of blinding light. All I see is white like in the movies. Then it goes out and as my eyes readjust to the dark I realize it is way darker then it was before. ""My eyes must be still adjusting"" I think to myself. I get home didn't check my phone once in thought that my eyes will adjust to the light. I get home to my parents hugging me asking me where I've been. ""Just out back with cam. Mom I told you this at 10 in the morning don't you remeber?"" 
""Honey it's 2 in the morning. What else happend to you?"" 
""I don't know. Wait it's what time?"" 
I look at the clock and it's 2:26 am 
""Mom... I... I don't know.... What's going on?""
""Can we can discuss this in the morning?"" 
""Fine."" 
I get in the shower feeling like when you wake up from an hour nap and you wake up just before rem sleep and you feel like crap. I get to bed and fall asleep as soon as I got under the covers. I wake up in the morning and Google what I experienced and came up with alien abduction. It said any new scares or cuts and after about 5 mins on searching I found one on my finger. Faint but still able to make out. If I could as a picture I could. Just tell me and I will send you one if you want. 
Thank you for reading this if you made it this far."
571,"Personal - Weird experience when I was younger, anyone see it too?",Abductions,0,"Here's an experience I had when I was younger:

I was about 12 years old, I was up at night, trying to fall back asleep, not sure what time. We had a fluorescent light in the hallway that we used as a (overkill) nightlight, and the indirect light from it would get cast onto the wall wood paneling beside my bed. I was staring at it, trying to get back to sleep, then I saw a shadow flicker, literally flicker, past the light. I completely freaked out and hid under my blankets saying ""what the fuck"" and ""what the fuck was that"" over and over and over. Today when looking back at that moment I still don't know what was the big deal or why it scared me so much.

The weird thing that happened was that a light flew in in between my blankets and my mattress and flashed me in the face like a camera. Just like getting a flash in the face in a dark room, I was blinded for a few seconds, during this time I was pulling away my blankets so I could see the top of the bunk bed. Like seeing a weld flash, it left a ""trace"" of the light I saw, [this is what it looked like](http://i.imgur.com/FB7CQJh.png). After I could see again, I decided to go to sleep, just like nothing happened.

Has anyone else have the same type of experience? Does anyone know what the image means? I've been wondering if it's the eyes and sides of the face of a grey. I can't say for sure since it was lit and I couldn't tell any other characteristics besides what the flash looked like.

572,Bits of memory keep coming back,Abductions,3,"
Hello guys. I'm not sure where to start. There is quite alot of information that even I have a hard time accepting. I've read up alot on the forums (as much as I can read in a few hours), and have found alot of similarities in my story. I'll try to start from the beginning. I see alot of people that have had clear memories with vivid details, and most have been happening for years. Mine comes in bits and pieces and just started recently. 

I would say the whole thing started happening about two weeks ago. I woke up really startled in the morning from some really crazy dreams. I'm a vet who's been deployed, and most of my dreams have to do with previous happenings there. That's why this one really shook me up. I can't remember everything about it, but I remember really clearly seeing a smokey filled doorway with a greyish being staring at me. I've seen pictures of ""greys"" but this one had a wider head with a blue tint to it. There were others there too, but i dont remember them well. It was as if they were showing themselves to me. I usually would have been really frightened by this, but I almost felt as if that was being repressed somehow. The dream ended with me cruising first person above a canal with trees canopied over it. That was it. I woke up really shaken.

After that night, my girlfriend had these huge bruises all over the back of her leg. She has been complaining alot about her eye bothering her in the morning too. Like it hurts to even wash her face. Today she also woke up with a huge rash covering her chest. I don't think it could be the detergent we use, because we haven't changed the brand in a while. I'll post the picture of her leg at the bottom. I don't think the bruise could have been from me kicking her or bumping into something, because she would CLEARLY wake up with the size that this bruise covers. 

At night I always feel as if something is watching me. I think of it as straight out of a horror movie when I go to check my other rooms. It runs through my head when i see some dummy going to check behind a door where Jason or Freddy is hiding. Nevertheless something does a really good job at making me think somethings there. We have a dog, and I figured the dog would be alerted to this as well. He's not. I'm not a great sleeper. I've had sleeping problems since i've been out of the service. Late at night I watch my dog, which usually sleeps through the whole night, get up and walk around. Just looking, not barking, standing in the same place everynight and then coming back to lay down. 

I've been waking up, when I do sleep, with horrible pains in my ankle. Last night I dreamt of my old squad with me, around the same street where I grew up. Our Platoon Sergeant made me and two others take off our shirts while he poked me in the back to get skin samples off me. I could almost feel the prick in my dreams. I don't know what to make of it. Either that, or i'm in denial. I'm not sure if I want this to be true, or to chalk it up to bad dreams and coincidences"
573,Need help explaining mysterious surgical clips!,Abductions,1,"I'm new to reddit and am wondering if anyone has had the same experience as a family friend. After suffering from extreme stomach pain she went in for an x ray, they found a mass of tissue on her uterus, and then repeatedly asked if she has ever had back surgery. She was confused and they told her that she had two surgical clips in her back. She says she has never had surgery for anything. It seems like the mass isn't serious and the pain will be easy to fix, but the clips remain a mystery. Any similar stories or ideas?  "
574,Please help: I think my wife is being routinely abducted,Abductions,8,"For several years now, my wife has been accumulating more and more characteristics of a long-term repeat abductee.

* Insomnia
* Frequent night hallucinations (hypnogogic dreams) of intruders in the house; sleepwalking
* Sleep paralysis
* Long-term unexplained illnesses, resistant to therapies and medication
* Grids of dots on skin upon waking (only twice, a few years ago) (still trying to find the photos)

She is not a believer in this kind of phenomena, and I've only recently started putting the pieces together. She pooh-poohs my suspicions, and so I don't bring it up anymore.

I'm in a terrible place. I'm sickened at the thought of her being victimized in the way I've read in the case studies. And bittersweetly, if she *is* a repeat abductee, I'm in a place to actually run experiments on preventative measures and/or gathering more evidence.

This is the one place I thought I'd find sympathetic folks with some ideas on what I should do."
575,No where to run no where to hide 2,Abductions,3,"Sorry I have to admit it really is strange sharing all this I tryed and succeeded to forget what I remembered for a long while. The morning after the  incedent I woke up on the floor in my mom's room I remember being confused opon  awakening  couldn't remember why I was in moms room. Mom said I had a nightmare and came in her room last night.  I didn't remember anything of it at that time but after that night I began to have recurring nightmares and would often sleep walk around the house and turn all the lights on and TV , a couple months later  I was sick with strep and I was laying on the coach watching a nature show on pbs I was in between being asleep and awake when the events of that evening flashed in my mind I seen it all I didn't understand it at that time , no not then..          I told my mom she said it was all just a dream..but I didn't tell her everything I knew as I felt like it was just to weird and she definitely wouldn't believe me, iv never told any one what I saw until now.          While in moms room on the floor by the water bed , I seen a head of what looked like a giant grass hopper or mantis. As soon as I saw it it was beside me I couldn't move I felt like I was falling off a building or something like falling.. but I was hovering over my mom's bed, they were up looking at me but they couldn't move either. .
I got really frightened but I couldn't scream I started to feel as if I might die just then I heard a voice the same voice in my dreams, it said.   ""do not be afraid we are not here to harm anyone just relax"" and I felt calm at that moment,  I felt kinda sick to my stomach from the falling feeling but I was calm I started to float up further I remember thinking ,, I'm gonna hit the ceiling and it's gonna hurt,, but instead of  hitting the ceiling, I went through it...nothing broken just went right through the roof of the house..I knew there were other beings with me I just couldn't move my head to see them but I knew that there was a weird giant insect next to me , as soon as I cleared the roof I saw the ""egg"" shaped thing,, orange glowing really bright and in an instant I was on a metalized table,  but it was warmed..and comfortable, I still couldn't move but I was able  to move my right hand from the wrist down and now I could move my head side to side. The room was dim and it stinks like garbage and  rotten eggs, slowly the room began to light up, not from a lightbulb more like the walls and the ceiling and the floors were lighting up . the room was glowing, my eyes hurt me but slowly my eyes become adjusted to the bright light it was a really strange light it wasn't like anything I've ever seen there was no shadows with this light..very strange... I remember noticing  the walls were silver Chrome Lit up with a  weird white glowing light resonating from them..the walls ceiling and floors all conected and the room was circular it was much larger than the egg shaped object I saw so I figured I wasn't inside the glowing egg I must be somewhere else? But I was really dreamy feeling and didn't dwell on it, there were small what I assumed were round doors all a round the room the doors were like little ""hobbit"" doors,, small and oval. Or arched. they had no knob either,  I was thinking why is this place so smelly but looks soo clean. ??  Mainly because I was all weird feeling all doped up feeling.. I should've been trying to get outta there but no,, I was just wondering why it stank so dam bad. ?,  all of a sudden I seen the door to my left slide  up really fast . Then the one on my right out came a group of mantis like  creatures looking similar to each other but different,, they came swarming out of the doors really fast and zoomed around the room little holes opened up on the walls and these little guys would run up to the holes and pulled out a purple hose like thing, then they would run up and atach them to the underside of the table, the creatures were small 3 ft tall mostly greenish but also some what blueish..a taller one squeezed through and stood up it was at least 6' tall..it was on my left side it bent over the table and looked down at me in my mind I heard it say ""the pain will not last long"" and it very quickly atached a square  black plate like object on the palm of my right  hand it hurt like hell felt like burning and then stopped hurting and started to feel soothing, then I felt a pinch in both calf muscles and in my forearms,  I began to feel really good I remember I was smiling and all these ugly things were running around me doing who knows what  but at that point it didn't bother me one bit. A thin clear piece of I thought was  glass appeared above my head I didn't see it before so I think maybe it came out of the ceiling it floated down to about a foot away from my face and shinned a blue light directly into my eyes I blinked  and felt compelled to look into this blue light it then started to make pictures a video of sorts except it's clearer than real life, best I can explain... the video was showing plants and showing the plant seed  grow then die in fast motion, it showed insects going through there life span, then it showed animals a lion mating with a lioness,  horses mating with horses I saw the sperm and the egg the entire  growth patterns of these animals in the womb. I felt exhilarated the emotions were extremely overwhelming the animals also died and decomposed into the earth then grass would sprout up  then other animals would come by and graze on it. it was all very strange of course,. Then it showed me a man and a woman having sex , I felt really weird and kinda like why am I seeing this? Than I heard a voice say "" life must flourish"" 3 times I heard this..I then started to see the earth from orbit on the screen the earth looked normal then I saw the earth move slightly and when it did it displaced the oceans I could clearly see the oceans move violently I then seen smoke and large fires all over the planet..it was very terrifying to watch but what I saw next was worse it seemed as if I was watching the planet in fast motion so not long after the planet tilting and the oceans flooded everything I seen rockets launching from all over the planet they were nuclear and they destroyed everything that was still alive after the flood.. I was sobbing uncontrollably  I felt  like I didn't want to live it wasn't worth it..then a voice said.                              ""life will be preserved""  and I blacked out. That was my first incident with ""THEM""... . . ."
576,No where to run no where to hide...,Abductions,6,"I am new to this so I ask only for leniency if I screw up here..but I want to share something that iv never shared to anyone before.in fear people will think me clinically insane, so what better a way than to share it here anonymously.  I am Cymatx1 I am 40 years of age, male, a product of the 1970s , at an early age my dad left me and my mom so I always felt like I had to be strong for her because she was always crying on my shoulder about how my father had left us and deserted us I was only four or five..anyway mom met a new guy fresh out of the Marine Corps..they got married soon after, we moved to a place called del-comino a trailer park just east of Longmont Colorado next to Highway I-25, we live in a single-wide  green trailer on Grove street my room was at the far. North part of the trailer, my parents room was at the other end in between was the kitchen and living room , I was about 8 years old when one night while in bed I heard someone calling my name it was a soft and comforting voice calling me I walked down the hall trying to figure out where the voice was coming from it sounded like it was coming from outside so I unlocked the door open the screen door walked out onto our big red patio that my stepfather had built but when I got to the edge of the patio I looked over and I saw that there was nothing there I mean nothing there was no ground there was no cars there was no other trailers there was just the patio and me I remember freaking out crying out loud and then all of a sudden something grabbed me and when it did it grabbed my shoulder and I felt extream pain radiating through my entire body suddenly I came to and I realize that I was outside on the patio naked and my stepfather was spanking the hell out of me for going outside at 2 o'clock in the morning that was pretty weird but not as weird as what happened the next night...the evening after dinner and a movie we rented vhs tapes from block buster video at that time..we watched superman with Christopher Reeves and then I went to bed..instead of dreaming I was superman flying around this is how it went..a voice, soft comforting, calling my name this time coming from my window my window faced the street, I had no curtain so it was  always lit up in my room a little from the orange glowing street lights, but when I opened my eyes to see who was calling me I noticed the room was really bright orange and I sat up in my bed which was directly across from the window  and through the window was an orange glowing egg?!? About 10 feet diameter. .floating above Grove street about 10 feet of the ground, I couldn't figure out wat it was I didn't think of a space ship or aleins at the time I just watched it..hover, . Then it got even brighter like the sun, i felt heat one my exposed skin.. I got really scared at that point but I couldn't move...I felt frozen sitting up in bed facing the object in the window, then I felt a tingling sensation all over me I looked down at my chest and noticed  small ant like insects?  But they were metallic about the size of ants but looking mire like tiny rectangles,. They were crawling all over me my legs face chest and arms and I could not move I was terrified! !. Just then the"" robot ants"" disappeared into thin air all at the same time the light dimmed and I could move again but for some reason  I layed back down and pulled the covers over my head, the voice was no longer there but I  felt a presence in the room with me I was petrified I began to think that I got to get to my mom's room quik!! But I was so afraid of what ever was in the room with me that I was really having a hard time getting the courage to do it..finally I gathered enough guts to throw the covers off and jump up to my feet I looked at the window there were 4 beings just like the so called greys in the middle of the street they all turned and looked at me all at the same time and  in 1 split second one of them was at my window staring at me it's movement was so fast I could not see it move from the street to my window I freaked out screamed and started to turn and run when I heard a crash in my closet, ,at that point I wasn't sticking around for the next suprize...I high tailed it down the hall through the kitchen jumping over the couch and straight into my mom and step dad's room..dad not to happy at this point but mom new I was really upset so she gave me a blanket and pillow and I laid down on the floor next to their water bed . A was feeling calmer and started to fall asleep then I heard somthing in the room...I screamed  mom!! mom!! but they didn't wake up I said it louder neither of them woke up, I heard shuffling in the room and then a bang against the  water bed I looked down towards the foot of the bed and suddenly a big ugly insect like head popped out it was crawling on the floor at the foot of the bed....and that is where it all started...thanks for listening. "
577,Guys... I think I was abducted by the Greys last night...,Abductions,6,"This happened around 4-6 in the morning.
I was in a Lucid Dream, I usually astral travel during my sleep, my dreams are so real that I confuse them with memories. 
A little back story, I have never given much thought or research on Aliens because I am terrified of them, I do know they exist, but up until today I lived my life paying no mind to them, simply because I want nothing to do with them and not be under their radar. 
Back to the story.
The ""dream"" started when I was walking through this museum about aliens, more specifically, all about the Greys. After leaving the main room, we ended up being inside this room, I was strapped on a hospital bed, these doctors didn't look human, their voices were different, extremely tall, very cold.
They kept poking me and testing me, I remember being terrified, crying, begging to stop. 
That is when the put something in both of my arms and said-
""Your pain level is going to be on max-""
I screamed and cried begging them to stop, with no success. They were clicking buttons which transmitted an extremely weird kind of pain, agonizing. They did that a couple of times after a while they let me go. 
Still feel like i'm being watched. 

I woke up with a bruise on my leg and both my arms were numb. 

What the hell happened last night??!!  "
578,"Do you dream of making contact with ETs a reality for human beings on Earth? Develop telepathically... Be kind, refine your ego...",Abductions,1,"To change the face of human psychology completely…

Psychic mediumship and telepathy is expressed throughout pop culture. What this means is that other human beings are expressing their observations about reality through art. Art is a powerful medium which can heighten awareness in other individuals very quickly. Artists take their own life experiences and inner realities and display them for the public to see. Awareness of ESP is expressed over and over and over again in the artistic world. It's time to own up to the truth and be real: we are all psychic. Telepathy is real, and it should be used well (with kindness). We are all psychic mediums, and when we believe in ourselves, we can connect with the spirit world directly telepathically. We don't need religions, other psychics, or authority figures to tell us what reality is. We have our own observations, and when we open our minds to new information, more confirming experiences about the truth of reality. There is no death. There is a difference between being extremely confident in our observations and expressing this confidence to other people, and being authoritative. Think for yourself. Question authority. Do the right thing.

584,my childhood,Abductions,3,"I lived in a house that was remolded when I was 8ish.  About that time wired things began to happen. It was believed to be haunted. First my sister began seeing a boy enter her room at night. She had seen him out side her window (2nd story). My father began seeing a shadow child enter his bedroom while he was resting. Our two dogs barked at the walls and chased things around the house. Ghosts!!

Except for me. I saw strange lights outside my window one night. I opened the shad and saw a common grey looking at me. I was calm and felt at peace. I saw them frequently in my room. Hiding in the corners looking at me. 
I got a pet ferret and it was caged at night. I saw a reptile like creature standing behind my bedroom door. My mother opened the door to check on me, the creature seem to evade into the wall as she opened the door. When she closed it the creature came forward. It was very interested in the ferret and inspected the cage. it then turned to me, this was the first time I felt fear around one of them. it moved over to me and looked down at me. That is all I remember. the next morning, getting ready for school my mother pointed out bruises and scratches on my back.
Anther creature I saw illumined its own light ,but did not light up the room, and was standing next to the head of my bed. When I noticed it the creatures eyes got wider or more opened as if i was surprised. 

I dont remember anything after seeing them.

My family still talks about how the house was haunted and the strange noises and the tv changing channels. Our friends who visited and stayed over night are witnesses to some of the strange happenings.

so, did we have ghosts or aliens...guess we will never find out. The only thing we all agree on it that house was special."
585,Terrifying dreams of being abducted came back,Abductions,10,"Not sure if this is where I should be posting this, if this isn't the right place please point me in the general direction.

When I was younger I was obsessed with ufo's and aliens. Like most kids in their early teens I would imagine. I would stay up past 9pm and watch shows like UFO files, Unsolved Mysteries, and similar programs.

I can't tell you if the fascination came first, or the dreams. Lost time litters my past, some of that time lost can be easily explained as blacking out during binge drinking at 17 or the like. But some of this missing time goes all the way back to when I was in elementary school and cannot be explained by such things.

I used to have some of the most vivid dreams. Some of these dreams were of being taken by aliens. Dreams where an object stays outside my house, outside a store where I am with my friends or family, or just the lights or sounds. These dreams were always accompanied by beings coming for me and sometimes others in my dreams as well. These have been some of the most vivid dreams I have ever experienced in my life. I wouldn't start panicking in these dreams until I would see the beings, entities or whatever you want to call them, then I would really panic until they would get close enough to me, then I would *usually* just wake up. I do remember some where I did not immediately wake up but care not to recall those. None of these experiences or dreams were or would ever be pleasant. I knew this almost instinctively at some level. 

As I got older I started to dislike the subject and try to ignore it altogether. It was an almost irrational aversion as I hit my mid to late 20's. A fear. I'm in my 30's now and have 3 children. My oldest son who is 13 shares my earlier passion or unnatural obsession with aliens and ufo's.

I don't remember exactly when the last dream I had was. Sometime into my late teens they were getting so frequent I was having them almost nightly. And then they slowly petered out in my early to mid 20's I guess. I remember once I got a good enough look at one in one of those dreams and ever since then I would see them everywhere. In dark rooms, the corners of my eye. Anywhere there was a shadow I would see them. I refused to sleep with the lights out until I was in my late 20's. A grown man sleeping with not just a nightlight. I would keep the hallway and bathroom lights on too. I would freak out if I had to enter a dark room for any more than a moment and always run as fast as I could out of them. I was terrified of what I was positive was there but could not see.

Last night was the first time in years I have had a dream like this. As always, I would try to run from them, and fight them when I could. If you can even call it fighting, more like an ant trying now to get stepped on. Trying my best to keep them away from me, because as soon as they would touch me or get close enough to touch me, I would wake up in my bed, or come to in a weird place. Truly terrifying, even in a dream when you are unable to remember what happened. 

I woke myself up last night shouting out the name of my youngest son during this nightmare. I was taken several times at first in my dream and could clearly see the ufo in the dream. It looked a lot like the one from close encounters but much bigger and a lot less lights. A much more pronounced upside down pyramid shape with horizontal spires jutting out around the middle with a more domed shape at the top. The whole thing seemed to be in sections. At one point it was so close to me that I was unable to move and was holding onto a nearby fence with every ounce of effort I had. This was in broad daylight unlike most of the other dreams where I would be taken. Broad freaking daylight. There were 2 other people with me consistently in this dream but not anyone that I recognized. I had begged one of them to come and grab me to help get me away but they were just as terrified as I was, and were also trying to run. They were getting taken too. When the things started coming out of the base of the ufo I woke up in my bedroom. Unaware that I was still dreaming, hearing the eerie pulsing sound of the ufo from my bed, unable to move. I panicked and started shouting out for my youngest son instinctively but he never came to me. After shouting for him a few more times I actually woke myself up from shouting for him. It was that hoarse half whimper sound that comes out in a nightmare when you try to yell for help but nothing really seems to come out. As soon as I was able to muster enough strength to shout his name at the top of my lungs I had woke myself up mid shout. I immediately checked his room which is right next to mine and he was fine. So were my other 2 kids.

I just finished chain smoking about half a pack of cigarettes to calm my nerves down. During that time I was debating internally whether or not I should post this to a subreddit. Part of me wants to believe it is just a dream, some sort of manifestation of my own fears or some stupid shit like that. Part of me is absolutely terrified at the possibility that these could be memories of actual things that happened leaking into my dreams. Another part of me is afraid of what posting this might cause. Will the dreams start coming back now because I am actively thinking about them again? Is seeing those things this time going to make me see them in every shadowy room and corner of my eye like in my past? For the longest time I just wanted the dreams to stop and once they did I never thought twice about them again. Like they never really happened. Now it seems they are coming back, in force more than likely, and for some reason now in my dreams it seems I am more worried about my youngest son than myself. I really hope this isn't real and just some messed up way for my dreams to tell me about my insecurities or something. I'm worried and terrified and I don't know why. Dreams aren't supposed to be this real right?

I am sorry for such a long wall of text.

TL:DR I used to have dreams of being taken by aliens but they stopped. I literally just woke myself up screaming after having my first dream of being taken by aliens in years. And now its my son being taken I think. 

note: This is a throwaway account, I will monitor it to answer any questions. I just want to keep some of my more personal experiences and things separate from my main account for reasons."
586,Nordic alien abduction/monitoring,Abductions,0,"I believe I was abducted by the Nordic aliens. The reason for my suspicions is a really vivid memory of a dream I had growing up (over 12 years ago) that I can still remember like it just happened. The entire dream was a tale pale woman with blonde hair wearing a see through white flowing gown. The most striking thing about her though was her eyes, The deepest blue. I also had an overwhelming since of love, arousal, and attraction towards her. Those feelings come back anytime I recall the dream. On top of the dream, I've had bad insomnia my entire life, an overwhelming fear of open doors/windows, often hearing a buzzing or ringing that nobody else can hear, I've seen a black triangular shaped ufo flying over the highway on a drive back to the naval base I was statoned at, I sleep walk (often waking up somewhere with no knowledge of how I got there), and I always feel like someone is watching me particularly at night. Anyone had similar? Particularly the dream portion?"

590,My experience,Abductions,8,"This happened to me in middle school, I think the 7th grade, so i was about 13/14
For some context I live in the suburbs in essentially a 2 floor home in the suburbs. I slept on the second floor and next to my room was my brother's and my parents. My room has a walk in closet on the far wall from the door and next to that is a window. My bed is next to the door opposite the wall with window/closet.

 I went to bed as usual around 10:30pm/11pm, when all of a sudden I woke up around 3am laying on my back with my arms and legs spread out with no blankets just my pajamas on. This very strange for me to wake up like this because I normally sleep on my stomach. Anyways, I wake up and hear this very loud humming or vibrating and find myself unable to move. I was scared shitless but I tried getting up and found myself unable move any part of my body except my neck, albeit a few inches. I pick my head up as much as possible and see this blue light shinning from, where should have been the window. Around the light I see multiple silhouetted figures and I was freaked out. These things were pointing and moving, definitely communicating. I tried yelling for help but I couldnt make noises, it was impossible to speak. Then the vibrating/humming increased in intensity until ultimately stopped and I was able to move my body. After the paralysis ended I found myself in bed, I hid under the covers and faced the wall. I heard strange noises in my room and had the sensation of being watched for what seemed like forever. I finally got enough courage and looked around my room and saw nothing, I didnt sleep the rest of the night.

This has happened two more times and hasnt happened in a few years. This could easily be sleep paralysis but im not sure. My brother also told about a dream he had when he was younger, in it he floated out the window and followed some light."

592,My Wife's Weird Abduction Dream,Abductions,1,"My wife and I had a weird experience, something I was more curious about than her at the time. We lived in Tennessee and we were really poor, so we slept on a memory foam mat on the floor in our living room. We later upgraded to a futon, but that's not really important. I always slept on the left side, next to a coffee table we had, and one night I woke up really uneasy. I remember seeing what looked like a red laser pointer beam (that's the best I can describe it) darting side to side really fast on the side of the table, as it was very low to the ground. It is important to note I had my back turned to my wife, which was also the source of the light, and I was so tired and out of it that I really didn't think too much of it. I just remember waking up and seeing it and thinking how weird it was as I fell back asleep. A couple hours later,  I woke up laying flat on my back. I opened my eyes and just felt awake. It had to be 3 or 4 in the morning. I felt uneasy and didn't like how I just woke up suddenly feeling so alert. Then within a minute of me waking up, my wife creepily just sits straight up from being in a dead sleep. The issue I have with this is how she sat up. It was so fast, and her body didn't move naturally. I tried to recreate her movement, and I couldn't do it. She didn't bend or curl her back like a normal person would while using their abdomen to sit up. She stayed flat and just sat up all unnaturally. I immediately rubbed her back after this happened and just started saying, ""It's okay babe, you were just dreaming, you're fine."" The thing that bother's me is how I didn't feel fine when she did that, and I was almost telling myself that it was okay. I was just really uneasy that night. Here is the worst part. The next morning, I was telling my wife what happened, as she didn't remember, and she explained what she was dreaming about. She told me in her dream, she was on an 'operating table', where entities had abducted her and were getting ready to cut into her. She kept trying to tell them to stop in her dream, but they didn't care, so she sat up as hard as she could. I had no idea until the next morning that she was dreaming about that. Really freaked me out. She thought it was just coincidence, but I was uncool with the red light I saw, coupled with me waking up in such a weird way, right at the perfect time for her to sit up. Any ideas? Was I just wasting my time being concerned?"
593,Beings at the window...,Abductions,7,"Hi, 
When I was about 4 or 5 (and subsequently until I was 11), I slept in my bed which had the window above the headboard. I can't tell you how many times this experience happened, but I would wake up in the night. Immediately terrified, I would look up and in my field of vision, a tiny dot of light would fly in from the left into the sky through the window. It would stop dead and by this time I'd be freaked out.
I would freeze and that's when ""they"" would appear. Either they would be suddenly around me tickling or grabbing me or they would float outside the window. I thought they were ghosts. They were just odd, and would freak me out.
As time went on, I realised that i could run to the end of the bedroom or even downstairs before they would get me. Usually it felt like something was pulling me back into my room, and I'd claw myself down stairs hoping my folks would be sitting in the living room. Sometimes they would, other times they wouldn't. I'd be screaming at them and they would be blank, staring at a blank or fuzzy TV screen. ""They"" would float along the floor toward me. Sometimes looking like ghosts, other times I would see a devil. But ultimately... They'd get me. The next bit is odd.
I don't recall being taken out the house, but pulling was involved.
I would suddenly be in a dark corridor being taken into a large (and I mean enormous) cylindrical room. In the centre would be an illuminated podium and a larger being. I would call her the ""witch"" and she would look down at me. Her job was to ask me 3 questions but I never managed to answer her questions and all of a sudden, the floor beneath would drop. I would wake up with a jolt in bed.
Sounds far fetched but when my brother and dad cleared the loft, they found an old school work book from when I was 6 (1988 for context). Inside was the story, written crudely and an illustration with what is clearly a UFO and a grey. I get shivers thinking about it. 

I must know if anyone else has had a similar experience or has heard of ""the witch"" in regards to alien abduction. I was so young and I've always been convinced it was a dream but not so sure now.

Cheers"
594,(x-post from /r/UFOs) An Experience I Had 5 Years Ago,Abductions,4,"Sometime in the middle of October 2010, I was up late playing computer games in my bedroom on the second story of my home here in Harleysville Pennsylvania. I was getting tired around 12:30am and decided to go to sleep around 1:00am. I fell asleep quite quickly in nothing but my boxers. Before I go into detail about the encounter I experienced, allow me to explain the layout of my room relative to the map I submitted.
My bedroom is on the second story on the southwest end of my home. I have 3 windows in my room on the front face of the house and have access to both the attic and the only fire escape on the building. This house used to be an old office building in which my bedroom was one of the offices used. My actual bed is located in the southwest corner next to a window and directly next to the fire escape door. This door has no handle on the outside and only a bar-release on the inside similar to what you would find on the inside of a school entrance door or office building. The door also has a 1.3x1.3 foot window in the top center. The actual fire escape on the outside of the door is nothing more than a metal platform and railing leading down the side of my house with metal stairs. I often use this to have a cigarette when I am at home since smoking inside the house is forbidden by the landlord. This goes to say I am quite familiar with what the scenery on the outside of my home looks like in this location.
I awoke on this day around 3am based on the dark of night outside, however, when I awoke I was already outside on my fire escape platform. I had not been dreaming as far as I could tell since everything was as it was when I am awake, and have had many vivid almost lucid dreams in the past, and I can tell you this was not that sensation. I was very groggy and confused as to how I had walked in my sleep. I have not sleepwalked since I was about 8 years old, and at this time I was 19 almost 20. I almost immediately noticed something very very large above me after this initial confusion, and took quick notice to my door being closed behind me leaving no way of re-entering my home.
As soon as I noticed this however, I felt the urge to look at this large object hovering above me. As I looked up I noticed it was sort of rounded in shape but had many many lights on the underside of it. It was directly above me so I had no view of the sides of the object. The lights were a very very bright white. Nothing like any fluorescent bulb I have ever seen. These lights were flashing without any pattern it seemed and were located all over the underside of the object in rectangular and very long trapezoidal shapes. The object had to have been at least 250 feet in diameter, possibly larger.
The underside of the object also had many things jutting out from it with these lights on it as well, but I took a firm notice to one in particular. There was this large piece with the lights on the side of it coming out from the right of the object. It's shape was like an upside down cone with the end cut off. It resembled an air filter for a high performance engine in a car. It had symmetrical lights all around its sides that were identical to the ones on the underside of the object, however the bottom of this piece jutting out was a very very dark gray-black color.
When I had first looked up, the lights were so blinding that I had to shield my eyes with one hand to see they were flashing and their shapes and locations. I observed all of this within less than 90 seconds before I became very disoriented. I forgot what I was doing, where I was at, and who I was. Almost as if these lights were inducing an acute case of amnesia. The last thing I can remember before passing out was the strange sensation of floating. I had never experienced this before, but it was as if I were suddenly weightless. My feet were no longer touching the cold metal platform and I was no longer shielding my eyes. As soon as I was blinded by the lights that were flashing I seemed to lose consciousness, unless the lights caused me to forget everything leaving me no memory of anything afterwards.
Throughout these short minutes the object made absolutely no sound. It was as if it was making everything around it completely quiet. If you have ever heard the saying ""Silence is Deafening,"" I would have to agree, there were no sounds made after I noticed the object above me. This was extremely strange since my home is on a main road, and relatively close to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Hearing not even the sound of a cricket chirp or the hum of the highway was definitely weird. I also remember the silence being almost suffocating. It felt very heavy, as if it were making the air thick like soup.
In my short, and very close observation, I remember the object being about 20 to 40 feet above me and the space in between my house and the neighbors house, and the tree in between the front of our homes was blocking out a portion of this large object. There was no wind, as if Time had stopped in its tracks. This is all simply speculation, but it was what it seemed to me.
After I lost consciousness, it got extremely bizarre. I remember waking up without any senses except for my sight and sense of balance. I was laying down with my eyes looking upwards towards what seemed to be a ceiling. My eyes were not working correctly though. It was as if I had been administered eye drops that you would get at the doctors to dilate your pupils. Everything was very blurry and distorted. I remember very little, but I do remember everything was a green/brown/gray color around me. I also remember seeing strange objects above me that appeared to be tools or examination equipment above me, none of which seemed to be created by humans. It was very very blurry though so it was hard to tell if that was exactly what it was.
I then remember a figure move into view above me. I was unable to move at all, and my vision was very poor so I could discern nothing about this being other than it seemed a little taller than I am and it had appendages like a human being (arms, torso, head, legs, etc.). It did not speak to me, however, I seemed to hear a voice in my head. It was much less a voice than it was a feeling or emotion being conveyed. The very last thing I can remember was feeling very calm, as if this being was trying to help me in some sort of way. The ""trying to help you"" feeling I received was much less about me in particular, but more of a ""you"" as in ""your race."" I then saw one of the objects above me move slightly, and I lost consciousness again.
When I came to I was sitting on the edge of my bed. My bed was made very neatly as if I had never layed down at all that night. When i looked at my alarm clock, the time was about 4:45am. I tried to remember how I got there, but nothing came to mind. I tried to sleep, but my thoughts were buzzing faster than I could even keep up with. I could not sleep no matter how hard I tried that night. The only thing I kept asking myself was ""Why wasn't I scared or afraid throughout this entire experience?"""
595,Recent possible of abduction of someone i don't know,Abductions,1,"TITLE EDIT:: Recent POSSIBILITY of abduction of someone i don't know (sorry for typo)

This is somewhat of a lackluster story, but my girlfriend and I were still scared. 

The other day at around 12:15 at night my girlfriend and I were going to go view the meteorite shower that was happening at the time. It was said to be at its peak around 1:00 am. So, we backed up some blankets and stuff and headed to a little clearing we know nearby, its not wilderness but it is secluded enough that light pollution is minimal. There is a road that runs parallel to it about 20 feet, but there are bushes and such so you can't actually see the road, but you can hear cars go by and can get back to the road in about 1 minute. Anyway we head out around 12:15 as I said as we wanted to get there early and set up blankets and whatnot. This is where stuff starts to happen. When we get into the field, before we have time to put blankets down and what not, we here a car. The car first just sounds like its driving, then tire screeching and skidding noises, then a crash. It wasn't a huge crash, but definitely loud enough. We look at each other for one second and are like ""We should make sure everyone is alright."" So we head out back to the road. It takes, as I said, no more than a minute to get back to the road. When we got there, pretty quickly, we see... nothing. No car, no people, no signs of damage to vegetation, not even tires marks from the skidding we heard. We thought it may have been further down the road so we walked about 30 seconds in the direction the car was going (could tell by sound car made before skid). We still see nothing. There are no street lights on this stretch of the road for about 300ft, so we could see light down the road but still needed a flashlight for seeing around us. When we were walking I swear I saw a figure, just a shadow of what looked like a man, cross from the middle of the street to the side of the road we were walking on. But as we came closer we saw again... nothing. No man, no trace. As we could see no signs of crash further down in the light added on the fact that a car passed by driving in that direction we decided to head back as if there was anything that car would deal with it. We went back to the field where we then noticed that the time was 12:49, MUCH longer than we thought had passed. It was not the walking and searching that took that long for sure as I said it is close by. It could have the drive here but that doesn't take more than 5 to 10 minutes and that's during the day with traffic. So that was weird too. The meteorite shower was cool, saw a good number of cool meteorites burning up in the atmosphere. After some about of time, around 1:15 ish, we hear a low breathing sound. Sounded a little like a boar, but they're are none around. We shine our lights around adn we see glowing eyes of some animal looking back at us, which then proceeds ti run away and a sort of hopping/ jumping fashion. A bob up and down of the reflective eyes. I figure it was just a dear as they are EVERYWHERE here and that the eyes were about deer eye level and that sound could have been that sound easily. Anyway we were scared mainly from the crash, my girlfriend really wanted to leave so we packed up and headed back to our car and got out in a hurry, but not a panic. So that's the story. Again not too fancy, but definitely spooky. We both believe in alien life, though I am very, very skeptical that they have visited earth. She wants more than anything to be abducted by friendly aliens and just chill. What was weird about the crash to me were a few things. 1) That we heard the crash both, but saw no wreckage or trace of anything out of the ordinary. 2) That the guy didn't check to see the damage that we clearly heard in the crash. We never heard a guy go out of his car or anything. 3) We never heard him drive off, we heard the crash and then it was silence till the second car. and then more silence. 4) The amount of time that passed was way more than I thought reasonable. So you decide what happened. I can't say with any certainty, but it is possible that he was abducted. "
596,Allagash Abduction - Speculation?,Abductions,1,"Just wondering what people think about the Allagash abductions on the 20th August, 1976. 

I have no doubts that aliens exist, I feel they do. Thanks to advances in science and technology, it's kind of obvious we are being watched, and NOT by a God. I also feel this abduction is extremely convincing. "
597,My mothers experiences...,Abductions,1,"Okay so this first one is when she lived in Plainfield ,IN . She was also pregnant with me at the time.

  So one night she just wakes up to the sound of feet running around the house . she found it to be weird and her first thought was that it was my half brother and sister fooling around . Seeing as they would have them over a lot to visit. When she was finally awake enough to gather her thoughts she realized my half brother and sister was at their mothers. She got up to see what the hell was going on fearing the worst. She walks to the door and reaches for the knob of the door. All of the sudden A voice tells her if she opened the door we will scare you. Terrified she ran back in bed and throws the covers over her head and closes her eyes trying so hard to go back to sleep. When she sees this reddish orange light start from her feet and slowly goes up to her head . When it reaches her head she blacks out . 

The next one is in the same house I had my experience in. 
All she can remember of this one is her being in bed when this flash of light comes from outside it is so bright is lights the whole room . When suddenly she is lifted out of bed and being pulled out the window she is desperately reaching and yelling to my dad to help her . He is fast asleep and doesn't wake up. She goes black after that.  There was a time when we lived with my grandparents, because our home in Plainfield was going to be knocked down to put an air stripe in its place. my mom was up late these one night she decided to take a look outside the window in the living room . my grandparents windows were all really big . She was just looking outside when she saw this red light start to descend a few house down . She freaked out and went right to bed . She has also seen light circle airplanes when she lived in Plainfield. she would always have trouble sleeping in the Plainfield house. So she would stand at the window and look outside a lot . She has seen a lot of UFOs.    "
598,My experience...,Abductions,8,"So first off I have to say as a child I feared aliens . I would have nightmares almost every night and some dreams of seeing UFOs coming down from the sky to the back yard. Some dreams were of me playing with tall white beings. So not all were nightmarish.   I could not sleep unless a was rolled up like a burrito in my blankets facing away from the window. I also as a kid would get whatever library books I could find about aliens and UFOs at the school library. My mom also had experiences while she was pregnant with me. She leaved in Plainfield ,IN pretty close to the air port at that time.   

In this experience I was at least 5, or 6. I remember waking up in the middle of the night. I slept on a bunk bed and always slept on the top bunk. I was thirsty like immediately. So I decided to go get a drink. So I started to climb down the steps to the bunk bed. Then I got really scared. So like any other kid would do I yelled for my mom. Who would fall asleep in the living room most nights. The house is pretty small. So my room is like right next to the living room. ""Mom ! I'm thirsty can you get me some water!"" ""Mom!"" is what i said. I got no answers back. So I was to scared to go out and get it myself. So I turned around and started to climb back up to the top bunk to just go back to sleep. I put one foot on the first step and for some unexplained reason I turn my head to the window. I just looked at it with a werided out look on my face . I then walked to the window. my dresser is in front of the window so I had to lean over it to look through the blinds. When I did there is my neighbors house right next door their drive way is separated from our house by a small stripe of grassy area that is ours . There were two beings one very tall and white and one very small and a little darker in color.They were standing right next to each other between the neighbors drive way and the stripe of grass next to my house.  I remember not being afraid at all at the sight of the tall being but I didn't want anything to do with the smaller one nor did I want to even look at it.  After seeing them outside my window . I awoke and it was morning. I remember being really confused as to how I got back in bed . I never told anyone about this tell I was older I told my mom.  then she told me about her experiences. which sounded scarier than mine does. I just know what happened was no dream . I had no other experiences that I remember or stuck out to me .   "
599,My Experiences,Abductions,11,"It first began when I was 7 years old. One summer night I was trying to sleep and I thought we were having an earthquake. I sensed a presence outside my window and a strong shaking/rolling sensation as if we were having an earthquake. It seemed like it lasted for a minute or so. The next thing I know it is morning and I am lying in bed. First thing I asked my parents in the morning is if they felt the earthquake last night. They said no and I thought that was odd. I went for a swim in our pool and experienced some pain in my genitals. I'm not going to go into all the details but I had small incisions and white things under my skin which I was able to remove. It was painful especially in the shower and the pool. Then I thought maybe this is what a wet dream was. So I told my friends on the way to school that I had a wet dream. When I explained the details they said that isn't a wet dream. I then replied I must have been abducted by aliens.

Years went by and I always remembered that experience and wondered about it. Since then every so often (at least 10 times) I have woken with strange unexplainable cuts on my skin. They are straight lines 2-5 inches long. Red and lightly scabbed, but they heal quickly. And they occur in places some of which I can't even reach like on my back. Once I woke up covered with 30+ scratches. My girlfriend at the time noticed them and asked about them. I did not have an explanation. She was sleeping in the same bed with me the night that happened. I've woken with these scratches off and on over the years sometimes it seems like years go by and then just when I think things are normal again I'll wake up with a new set of scratches.

I am currently married. A couple of months ago my wife and I were sleeping. My wife woke me up in the early morning and was disoriented. She said she went to bed with clothes on but now she was naked and could not find her clothes. She also said she heard weird noises outside our window and had strange dreams. I woke up with weird scratches on my skin that morning as well. I have never shared with her my experiences or beliefs and do not plan to.
I have no memories of ever seeing an alien. But logically that is the best theory I can come up with. I have not undergone hypnosis to try to recover memories and don't really want to. I would rather this never happened to me and is somewhat scary to think about.

Overall my health seems fine and if they wanted to harm me they easily could but seem not to. I have no real interest in going to ufo conventions etc. They seem mostly full of crackpots and also once you associate with that group it has a negative stigma and people think you are crazy. Most of the information I have found online has been interesting but I am skeptical as there are alot of weirdos out there so I take everything with a grain of salt.

I hope that one day this will all make sense. I am now in my 30s. Anyways just thought I would share. I am currently running a camera in our bedroom when we sleep. Not expecting it to work if this ever happens again but figured it can't hurt."
600,I Was Five,Abductions,10," My first memories began in this house. Central Texas 1969, my dad raised cutting horses for a living. A cowboy from heart, always and still is though today he's 74 and my mother, his wife of 58 years, passed away last December.

 My brother got his first drum set, he was fascinated with rock and roll and wanted to be a rock star, of course. We had a tire swing that hung from the oak tree in the front yard, too close to a cactus patch it would turn out. My dad had built a mechanical bull. primitive today but effective for the time period. It's was a 55 gallon barrel suspended by 4 large springs from a frame he had built. We was a welder.
 My dad tied steel for a living before I was born. Dams along the Colorado and Rio Grande rivers. He had finished the Two Rivers Dam located Southwest Of Dulce, New Mexico, saving his money to buy a ranch. I would be conceived here on Valentines day of 1964.  

 I was born that same year in San Angelo Texas, my dad would later move us to Rising Star Texas. A town very close to ^[Stephenville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephenville,_Texas). I had a purple tricycle and my mom was an Elvis fan and a James Bond fanatic.

 Mom had gone grocery shopping that day and had bought me a new toy. A James Bond Spy Kit. The box was as big as I could hold and I was in awe of all the goodies inside. I also discovered that day that a young colt, born of my dads albino mare, would play with me just like a dog but that's a different story as well.

 My parents were Southwest Baptist and we seldom had company that wasn't business related. This night they were having a party.  A hallway lead from the living room to the bedrooms and bath. Mom and dads was the master bedroom at the end of the hall with it's own bath. Mom wanted to put me in their bed so I would be farther away from the noise and be able to fall asleep. They were stringent about bed times. Being five I had conquered the art of pretending to fall asleep. Tonight was my to be my forte. ""They were having a party!"" I wanted to see what the grown ups did for fun. 

 When mom placed me in their bed the first thing I noticed was the bed was enormous, it was a queen and I slept in a twin. It was the size of a pasture. 
Mom kissed me and tucked me in then left right away. I didn't even have time to pretend to fall asleep for her to leave. Now I had to guess how long I needed to wait for them to forget about me and sneak my way down the hall to get a glimpse of all the action.
 She came right back, 'Crap.'

 That wasn't her? It was somebody else and it was wearing a hoodie? I actually wouldn't know what a hoodie was for a couple more years but anyway. When the figure stepped through the threshold of the door they raised their left hand. It wasn't a hoodie, it was the grim reaper. Large head and long thin fingers.
 I pulled the tucked in sheet as hard as I could over my head. The fear was the most intense I've ever felt in my life. I know what I saw and i would be 15 before i convinced myself it was a dream. I know it wasn't. I know what it was and I've always known.

 I had a close to photographic recall growing up. By mid grade school I was well aware that my parents and teachers stopped learning the day they left the last school they had attended. I had PBS. That was enough with my memory. I would scan through the book for each class on the first day of school and never touch it again. Now I had to wait for a school year to pass for them to question me on it whenever it was seldom my turn. I could have answered all the questions on the first day and got on with it, again that is another story. 
 When I was about nine (1973) my dad was going to sell the ranch and begin a career of harvesting. He was meeting his new partner in this new venture whom had a son 1 year older than me. We'd been friends for that whole day and where playing outside as it began to get dark. 

 While playing chase with Brad, he treed me. My only escape was to climb the nearest tree, a cherry I believe. I was climbing a cherry tree, Brad virtually on my heels when I stopped. A red orb was floating in the sky. It was as big as a house and was playing like a firefly in the sky. 
 Shortly we began to believe it was playing with us, it seemed to go where we wanted. Then suddenly it shot away towards the eastern horizon then back again. It left towards the North accelerating at a 45 degree angle at over 10,000 miles an hour or more. 

 That""s when a giant Roman candle appeared in the sky to our right, south. A white ball of light bleeding red, blue and green, Then another being just above it we could see the tiny parachute that held the first one. Then another to the North and then we could see the silhouette of a military bomber. A four engine prop plane. Then we both realized the last flare had gone off directly over my parents ranch.

 We turned and bolted towards the house only to meet our dads coming out the front door. They didn't have time to talk to us because my dads horses had jumped then fence and were in the highway.
 That night we sat in his room and listened to Fleetwood Macs Rumors and Queens A Day At The Races. We would be best friends for the next decade. I've never seen Brad since we graduated.

15 years old. Two friends approached me and said they'd heard of a beer store that sold to anyone. The old man that owned it was blind as fuck. They had money, I'd had a license at 14. Grandma was scared to drive, i could take her car anytime i wanted. First beer run of my life, 20 miles of dirt road. 

 The way back I'm doing 70 down hill on a dirt road when an owl with a wing span wider than the windshield passes over the top of us by about a foot. Lands 50 yards in front of us in the middle of the road. Slam on the breaks, WTF! Come to a stop and get out. Look at this fucker, WTF! He's sitting directly in front of the road we need to take to the left. I don't believe this shit! A four foot tall owl landed in the middle of the road and stopped us. He turns his head 180 degrees and looks at us. Turns his head back and flies away. WTF! This is my first beer run, really? 

 I am RH- and my scoop mark is below my left thumb on the top of my hand. I know what I saw. Here is a ^[map](http://i.imgur.com/28iH8Nx.png) of my birth and childhood.
I'm looking for anyone with a similar experience, 

**TL;DR** Abducted at five by a 5ft tall insect. Grew up with a photographic memory, watched orbs chased by the military and a 4ft tall owl stopped me on my first beer run at 15..
