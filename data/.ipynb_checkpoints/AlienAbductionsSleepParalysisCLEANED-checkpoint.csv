BF hearing voices,"So my boyfriend just shared with me his experience last night. Where he was trying to go to sleep but suddenly had the feeling of his whole body being electrocuted, and he couldn't move. Whilst he couldn't move, he began to hear voices, a lot of voices he described it as being at a dinner party. He says he couldn't distinguish what the voices were saying, or if the voices were male or female. He just said that there was a lot of them. So my first thought while hearing this was that maybe it was a form of sleep paralysis. But he swears that he was trying to go to sleep and couldn't. That's when it happened. and I've only heard people who've had sleep paralysis as not being able to move, but only seeing things in their room, like shadowy figures, not hearing things. Please reach out if anyone has any similar experiences or an explanation!",0
Is Blue Ink a Sign?,"When I was a teen I would go to my dads house every other weekend and I would sleep in his guest room. The window is probably 10 feet above the ground. One day I woke up and was in a very strange position. I was laying on my back with my arms and legs completely straight to my sides. I've never woken up like that before, I sleep on my stomach or my left side religiously. I felt very confused and anxious. I went to the bathroom and found what looked to be blue ink spots on my body in places that could not have gotten there from me. (My abdomen and thigh for example and none of my hands) I looked out of the bedroom window and the screen was knocked out into the frame, but the window was shut and the blinds were how they were the previous day. From that day on I've been scared to sleep by windows. Any thoughts?",0

A childhood nightmare,"I have only ever shared my recollections of a childhood nightmare I had when I was about 10 years old (28yo now) with a couple close friends for fear of sounding crazy for thinking it could have been an abduction. Unfortunately there are only a few things I recall from the nightmare - most importantly what I remember is that I was terrified for my life. 

I remember the nightmare in snapshots that may or may not be in logical order from start to end:

I recall that I somehow randomly awaken inside of an old metal ""cage"" (or cell?) with metal grated floors. It is a rather large room and I feel absolutely hysterical. I am screaming through the bars of the container I'm in, pleading to be let go. 

I recall being strapped to a table in a large grey and hazy room. 

I recall somehow escaping wherever I'm being held and I begin running for my life through what seems to be a very large, metal, and also somewhat deteriorated looking space craft. I have this sense that I'm being chased by something. 

I recall running through cavernous hallways, down metal stairways, past several cell-holding areas....the entire time I'm screaming and pleading to be left alone. I feel like I'm running through a maze with no end in sight. 

This part is kind of weird: I recall, in my escape, sliding down a very wide, steep, and very fluffy cloud-like slide. Whatever it was made out of, it was dense and the color pink.

I recall being recaptured but by what, I'm not sure. I beg whatever recaptured me to let me go. I'm somehow taken to what must of been the being in charge of the craft or in charge of my capture. I cry and plead to it to be released. 

That's all I really recall. It was one of those nightmares though that stays with you forever. I've never been able to visualize the things that were chasing me though.",0
THE LOWER ALLOWAYS CREEK INCIDENT PART 3 ALIEN ABDUCTION/UFO CRASH/COVER-UP,0,0
"Abduction possibly around November 7, 1994 in Richardson Texas","Okay so this is kind of a wild one, when I was born my parents always had told me of a dream my mother had, right before she found out she was pregnant. The funny thing about this is, my father also had a similar dream about being abducted by aliens and running through the alleys with our neighbors the same night of my mother. 
It gets weirder my father is not the only one that shared the dream with my mother;
Women up and down the street and the street behind my parents, six women total known, all ended up pregnant and some shared similar dreams of aliens and being abducted right before finding out they were pregnant.
This would pinpoint the abduction, based off of my personal conception date, being around November 7, 1994.
My parents lived off of Oak Street in Richardson Texas. 

If anyone knows more about this possible sighting, abduction or shares experiences or maybe one of the other babies born around that time please reply to this. I am just curious to know more about why we are all so closely related, and see if we have any weird Commonalities, or interests besides just Our date of birth. 




TLDR;
my entire life since I was born my parents always told me a story about my mother being abducted by aliens, and all these women around the neighborhood had similar dreams and ended up getting pregnant around the same time. All of us being born days within each other. My birthday is July 31st 1995.",0
Jumping in feet first,"I've written accounts of my experiences here in hopes that someone might recognize the elements of them. I wanted some assurance, I guess, that I wasn't alone. After reading what has been written, I find very few similarities to my own experiences, though there have been people which relate to one part or another separately from the rest.

I'm taking the plunge. This isn't a request for permission, or for your blessing; I'm just telling you what I plan to do, and I'm inviting you to journey with me if you so choose.

The events I described before were condensed versions. They were tightened, incomplete, and without the nuances of those situations. I've decided to write out the entire timeline from beginning to end. I've decided to write a book.

Before you condemn me, mind that I'm unlikely to sell a single copy. I've written a book before, and only 20 copies have been sold. I'm not doing this to become rich or famous. I simply have to tell the whole thing, and hope that someone out there reads it and understands. Maybe I'll be that small amount of affirmation for just one person, and that is more than reason enough to do it.

What I pose to you is this:

Would you like to read it as I go? I could easily post each chapter here, or even break it down into smaller parts. Every year should potentially be its own chapter, though the content of each year is so rich that it may take several chapters to get through 2012 alone.

I'm doing this, whether you read it or not.

Would you? Tell me truly.",0

Please tell me your abduction stories.,"So, uh, I feel strange asking about your abduction stories. My buddy has recently gotten me interested in alien conspiracies. Now before I go any further I want to make it clear that I have, for the most part, always believed in aliens. I have never been abducted, that I'm aware of, and I have no intention nor want to be abducted. The thought really scares me. So back to my reasoning behind asking for your stories. I was reading about the ""Oregon 2018 encounter"" and noticed some of the references they had came from Reddit users. So I've found my way into this sub. I really only want to hear your stories because I'm genuinely curious. I'm not hear to laugh at you because I believe you. I almost want this to be like a therapy session only not just for you guys but for me also. I think hearing about what happened to you may help me cope with the thought of being abducted myself. I hope this doesn't come off as me just looking out for myself but I hope it helps you guys as well. I read that a lot of people feel better telling events of their life that they had bottled up. Please tell me.",0

Discord Server,"Hey Abductees,

We are dedicated to unearthing the knowledge of the world that's unseen by the average person. Everything from extraterrestrials to spirits, the things that go bump in the night,  and the things we normally wouldn't believe even if we saw it broad daylight; these are the things we hope to enlighten masses to embracing. Our community started in 2017 when our old server owner was creating a documentary of Extraterrestrials. During this time we had flourished with a wealth of knowledge. But, In his search for the knowledge of the skies, he came across many obstacles such as shitposters and skeptics who would purposely muddy the waters, making it difficult to find the truth. During that period we were the discord channel for /r/aliens when most of the moderators there were inactive and it was full of toxicity. We then would regularly post here in /r/abductions. We fused with /r/bigfoot and /r/bigfootencounters shortly after as well. Now, as more people are becoming aware of the ET presence and are embracing the fact that, not only ETs, but the whole of the metaphysical world operates in capacities not usually picked up by our traditional 5 senses. We are hoping to expand and bring that knowledge back to the people willing to keep their minds open, and hope to expand our reality to something greater than our physical senses.

boy scouts missing time regression abducted by grays,This happened to me and my friend Alex when we were both 13 years old at the time. This took place in the Poconos Pennsylvania in the summer of 1998. Our troop went up to the Poconos for the weekend. Once we got there before noon we all got off the bus and headed to spot that we were going to camp for. Once we got there the camp leaders got everybody's tents all set up. They told us that dinner was going to be ready around 5. They told to us that we could explore the woods. My friend and I grew up around the area we knew our way around it. So my friend and I went on trail not to far where we were camping. We were walking and talking about sports and school normal kids stuff. This was around 1 in the afternoon. Then all of a sudden we hear a  noise coming from the sky we  both looked and saw a silver disc a ufo. Then we both looked at our watches they said 3pm. We thought it was only a few seconds that went by. We didn't know that we lost two hours and have know idea what happened to the time. We didn't tell anybody because that they wouldn't believe us. We kept quiet and didn't talk about it. Years later I began to have nightmares about that afternoon. Finally I so a therapist to regressed me to what happened that afternoon with my friend. Under regression what happened was that the ufo we saw in the sky landed in the woods about five feet from us. We tried to run but we couldn't then four gray aliens came out of the craft walked towards us. Then they took my arms and my friend's arms we walked to the craft into the ufo.  Once inside that aliens told me telepathy that you and your friend won't be harmed the told me that we to perform experiments on you boys I felt calm. Then we came to a room in the craft that looked a doctors office there were two tables once there the aliens told me telepathy that we have to take off your clothes for the experiments. I guess I said ok  then the aliens began to unbuttoned my shirt and the other two aliens were doing the same to me friend. Once out shirt came off the told us to lay down on the tables which we did then the started to remove our shoes socks unbuckled our pants and boxers off us. Once naked the told us the exam was about to start. Fist they started by taking some hair samples some blood from us and skin samples . Then came the sperm sample. They did us by taking a hose like device which had a suction cup from the ceiling. Placing it over my penis and my friend's as well. Somehow we both got an erection and our sperm went into this device. Once everything was done they told us that we could get redressed which we did. They brought us back to the spot where we were abducted from. We didn't tell anybody because they wouldn't believe us. I found out years later that my friend told he had experiences since he was little.,0

connecting the dots,"The recent news from the pentagon has me going back over my unexplained experiences with new curiosity, and not so quick to pass them off as normal unconscious phenomena.

I’m just going to detail everything abnormal and potentially UFO related - let me know if anyone there has experienced similar phenomena.

I have a memory from when I was maybe ten years old. I woke up in the middle of the night and my whole room was bathed in a bluish light, there was a sound like a deep whirring. I petrified and had the sensation that someone was looking at me through the window but I was too scared to turn over in bed and look. As I remember it I just lay there waiting for it to go away, and I don’t recall how long that took.

This may be unrelated but I used to often wake up with something like cat scratches on my arms and torso. They were raised and red like I was I had an allergic reaction, but usually they would be gone within a day.

Then there was the UFO sighting four years ago. This was at a lake in Maine called Lucerne. I was with a friend stargazing on a paddle boat in the middle of the night. Three lights formed a straight line flying in close formation in the distance, hovering over the lake. We both saw it and pretty much freaked out. The lights then each moved indecently out of the straight line and formed a triangle directly over our heads. 

As I looked at the lights I had the instinct to take out my phone and take a video, but then as I reached for my phone I felt a powerful aversion to doing so. It was like a thought popped into my head that said, “no, don’t”. When I think about why at the time I didn’t take a video, I believe I thought that if I took a video then the moment would cease to exist. Like if I took out my phone, I would miss out on the tremendous experience I was having. 

After hovering overhead it drifted into the distance and disappeared behind the tree line. Immediately I had the sensation that I was wet. I reached and touched my face, convinced I was somehow drenched in water, but as I continued to feel my face I realized I was completely dry.

Now for the kicker and the reason I don’t tell most people this UFO story. At the time of the encounter I was coming down off of a psilocybin mushroom trip. And everyone I talk to (especially people who have never tripped) pass the encounter off as an obvious hallucination. I know what mushroom hallucinations are. This was not that.

3 experiences this week after several year hiatus,"Just as the title states. Back in the early 2010s I had abduction experiences that were almost nightly and at the very least monthly. Then it seemed to taper off around 2013 and stopped all together until this week.

I’ve had good recollection of my experiences and the signs that surround them because I was heavy into daily, several hour long meditation sessions. Regularly exercising my brain I think helped me to to remember more than the average experiencer. I could remember things that happened while I was taken, not just the abduction itself. I’ve since fallen off the meditation wagon. I don’t remember seeing anything outright but I have lots of memory residue and signs this week that have me on edge now.

One tell tale for me is how my dream state is remembered. I usually have hyper vivid dreams with full recall and senses. When an abduction happens my dreams are distorted and hazy, and interrupted several times by jolting wide awake for only a few seconds before being slapped with complete blackness. Usually if I wake up in the middle of the night I have to go through a whole routine to fall back asleep. Get up, use the bathroom, drink water, etc. and still lay there for anywhere between half and hour to an hour before I can fall back asleep. It’s been this way for years now.

The blackness that hits during these experiences though is like being knocked out by a physical blow but with no pain. Just sudden BOOM darkness.

It took me a couple of days to figure out what was going on but even then it’s been so long I didn’t really believe it. The messed up dream states and blackness happened 3 times this week. But I also noticed 5 fresh bruises all over my arm and legs, all in similar stages of healing. I showed my partner who was equally disturbed. We have opposite sleep schedules and I often sleep alone. 

Then yesterday while at work I had splitting headache pain, but not in a spot I ever have one. It was in a tiny pinprick sized spot behind my right ear. Same spot ached all day, even if I have a migraine it will only last a few hours tops.

But the icing on the cake was this morning. I slept alone again and remembered having the weird hazy dreams, full alertness, then blackness a good 10 times during the night. I woke up absolutely exhausted like I didn’t actually sleep the night before. But I got up to start my day regardless only to freeze at my bedroom door.

I have a couple of small paintings hanging right next to the door frame, one was on the dresser and the other was tilted all crazy. Then right outside my doorway the long hallway rug was bunched up several times, pushed back away from my door like something had been dragged through the doorway and down the hall. All together it looked like a crazy struggle had gone down in my bedroom doorway.

My partner didn’t hear anything but had fallen asleep on the couch in the early AM in the living room. They wouldn’t have pranked me as they are a very “no nonsense” person who doesn’t believe in anything paranormal. I’ve also never told them about my experiences. 

I’m curious if anyone else has had long periods of being left alone before sudden frequent visits or if anyone else is experiencing an alarming amount of experiences this week.

Thanks everyone.",0
Hear me out...,"Not my story, I have been studying the person's account and he didn't mind me sharing his words:

Sorry, its a long read and I tried to keep it vague and short.

I always considered myself to be a rather intelligent man, having honors grades and graduating as my class valedictorian, I went on to become a doctor and spent 22 years in the Army, as a biologist. I have since retired from the military and have a private practice in my small town (which ill keep anonymous along with any names).
I've always believed in the prospect of alien life, but as for visiting aliens, I guess I never gave it much thought. However, the idea of alien abduction seemed down right ridiculous to me.
Trying to stay fit, when weather permits I like to walk to my office. Its about 3/4 a mile away and the walk allows me to get some exercise and a sweet view of the north pacific landscape. Usually a nice, relaxing walk thats typically uneventful. 
This day starts off like the rest. I left home early in hopes to get some quite time alone at the office, it was about 6 a.m. when i left home. I walk up the hill about halfway there and I see 3 kids up ahead in the distance. I can see they have some sort of flying toy above them...this was my impression from a distance.
They were out of sight while I approached but soon were in view and maybe 100 feet away. I remember thinking this was odd...then just fell asleep.
I dont know how long I was out for but I woke up and was on a bed. I remember thinking I must have passed out on my walk and they took me to the hospital...i got the impression of a medical setting due to the smell and super clean environment i found myself in.
I was having a hard time focusing my eyes and ears on the people around me. I took a minute but I finally was able to see that I was looking at this person's back. He turned around and I went into absolute shock.
This person looked like a man, but was certainly not human. The eyes gave it away. Large almond shaped eyes, with very vibrant purple color. The head was larger but not like people tend to picture an alien looking like. THEY LOOKED VERY HUMAN, but obviously not.
I was in panic, I jumped up and grabbed some sort of tool to defend myself. They backed off, and looked quite afraid. They're pupils were getting bigger and smaller at a rapid pace. One of them stepped forward and spread his arms out, as to protect his crew. I quickly ran off down a hallway.
I found myself in a narrow hall with doors on the left. I took the first door and as soon as I entered, bam! I found myself right back where I started. This time I went to the second door, bam!! Same thing.
I fell to my feet, trying to catch my breath and I'm sobbing and just freaking out. I remember I touched my hands to the floor and when i lifted my hands it was see through, for a few seconds and went back to metal. At this point I realized that I was in the air...i started to hyperventilate...it took me a minute, but I gather myself and realize that I'm going to need to confront these beings, in order to get home.
I get up and head back to them. As I approach one of them stands forward and presents me with a glass like, rectangular thing...picture a tablet device made of crystal with liquid colors inside.
He puts a hand of it and presents it to me, as if I should do the same. So I did. Instantly we were connected and communicating...not like words but thoughts, transfered from him to me. I knew what he wanted me to know, and vice versa. (I'll elaborate later).
Our communication did not last long, however the information was vast...like a very long conversation if we had spoken instead of using this amazing device. Afterward I was ushered into a room where there was a young girl in maybe her early 20s. She was sobbing on the floor holding her knees...""this must be a dream..."" she said, among other ramblings. I noticed that the wall on one side was made of glass and had separated cages built into it. Most of the cages were empty. The first cage, however had an odd animal. Small and furry like a dog is, but winged. Although it didn't seem these wings would be adequate for flying. Thus animal had a elephant like snout, or trunk. When it stared at you it would make you nauseous. Another cage had a regular earthly Labrador and one cage had a ""typical grey alien"" in it, he was either dead or asleep. Looked like it was just thrown about in this cage and never moved again.
At some point I'm fighting off an urge to go to sleep...it became too strong and I passed out. I woke up outside and the same ball of light I saw the ""kids"" on the path with, was floating above me. It shot up in the air straight up and was gone. Call me nuts but I think that ball of light, the size of a basketball, was their ship. Inside it was as big as a shopping mall.
During our communication period he explained that they come from a planet close to death. The remaining population that does live on the home planet are mostly those trying to save the planet. All the animals in the wild died off and most water poisoned. These beings go investigate planets with intelligent life and see how they address planetary issues, and what technologies they have that would help their efforts. They are interested in our animals and oceans.
Once they discovered humans they began to theorize that they evolved from beings that were once in a human-like state and believe earth is destined to end up like their planet if big changes aren't made soon.
Now I never would have even got past the second paragraph of this story was I asked to read it, but I promise you this is true. Im a medical doctor in a small town and going public may adversely effect my practice, also I dont want to be the face of this phenomenon. However, as a scientist I ask that you leave yourself open enough to see the facts and consider the real truths about this phenomenon.",0
Alien Experiencer Participants Needed for Research,"Hello!

I am currently completing thesis research work for my master’s degree at the University of Regina in the Department of gender, religion and critical studies and am looking for participants who are Canadian citizens or residents, aged 18 and older (19 and older if outside of Alberta), to complete a short online survey about experiences with alien abductions and contact! The survey will take approximately 20 minutes to complete and includes some demographic questions and some more detailed questions regarding participants’ alien abductions/contact. I am especially interested in those who have had sexual or reproductive aspects involved in their experiences! Questions include themes of sexuality, sexual interactions, and reproduction. All answers and information are kept confidential.

I am also looking for volunteers to be interviewed after the completion of the survey. All interviews are confidential as well! The interview will focus on the sexual and reproductive aspects of alien abduction and contact experiences. Questions include themes of pregnancy and/or infant loss, sexual violence, and sexual interactions. There are resources available to participants in the case of emotional distress and a coping plan available as well. Participants are able to withdraw at any time. Interviews will take approximately 45-90 minutes and will be held electronically or in-person. This study has been reviewed by the University of Regina’s Research Ethics Board. Feel free to share this information with others who may be interested!

If interested, please follow the URL to the on-line survey: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/alienabductioncontact](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/alienabductioncontact?fbclid=IwAR0hm4NZzpqqjecFFPvuReQxED0Tx3tAuQxpAKrZmpR76gyVKJC6I29-EN4)

Sorry if this doesn't make sense to you guys....,"So just watching fishermen out in sea made me think.... A fish being caught from its waters and then brought upon a ship/platform then being released into the sea amongst the other millions of fish. That fish might want to tell its survival story to other fish. The fish in the receiving end are probably going to. Be skeptical or non believers as there are so many fish who are lucky enough not to have even gone through that kind of experience. The ocean is so large the story may even of been the first time they have heard something as crazy. But it was true.
Now say these fish were actually humans, we could probably understand why most are non believers.... The planet we live on is huge! Is the principles the same in the fish story as a human abduction?",0

I may have been abducted. Missing time experiences.,"I have had 3 experiences of missing time and the third has me convinced that it, and possibly all three were abductions. 


1st. Not so much missing time as amnesia but still i cant help but feel like this experience is connected to the other two. 


My earliest memory is on my fifth birthday, I remember waking up in a strange state of having no specific memories, I remembered who I was, who my family were, the things I liked (starwars, dinosaurs, and the lion king, all of which are still awesome.) But I had no specific memories of events. It was as if my life started on that day with some general knowledge loaded into me. 


2nd. I'm around 20 years old. I'm living with my parents at the time and my room is in the basement. I have a digital clock in my room. 

I wake up to a sound that i can best describe as 3 notes being played on an electric guitar. Pleasant sounding and probably 3 notes of a major chord of some kind. I have my electric guitar hooked up to my amp upstairs and as this wakes me up I remember looking at the clock in my room and thinking ""who the fuck is playing mt guitar at 1:15am"" so i get out of bed and go upstairs to find no one. I spend 10 min checking the house and find nothing so i go back to bed only when i get back to my room the clock reads 5:57. From 1:15am to 5:57am it seemed that only 10 min had passed to me. Very strange but after a few months I mostly forget about and chalk it up to my tired mind playing tricks on me, untill... 


3rd time. I'm 25. I live alone in a cabin in the woods working for a retreat center. The house is down a dirt road that's maybe 1 and half miles long into the woods. My only neighbor within a couple sq miles lives just 300 ft or so from my house. 


One night im visiting my parents and leave around 9pm. My house is about an hour from theirs so expect get home around 10. I drive home, walk inside, do the usual routine of using the bathroom changing into pjs and then turn on my xbox to watch tv or play a game before bed. Only when i do the clock reads 1:17am. I double check with my phone and house clock. I should have gotten home around 10 but somehow its 1:17. After an hour or so of freaking out i go to bed. 


The next morning my neighbor calls me to ask if I saw ""strange orange lights last night around 10"" they were ""over your (my) house"" and ""looked almost like a sunrise."" 



The last experience combined with y neighbors account of lights has me thinking that i may have been abducted sometime between leaving my car and entering my home that night. Can anyone help me figure out what happened that night? It was 2 years ago now and thinking about it since then i cant help but feel the 2 earlier experiences are connected somehow.",0
Unexplained Time Missing,"Hi there. I wanted to finally share my story in hopes that someone has had something similar happen or can help me figure out what happened to my mom and me a few years ago. I don't have a UFO story. I never saw an orb or light, but what happened felt equally as odd and terrifying at the time. Reading over my story I know it may not add up to someone who is not from Oklahoma and can sound like we just forgot that we drove through an area, but that's not the case.   
In September 2017 my mom and I both took off a day of work to drive to Ardmore Oklahoma from OKC so that I could file paperwork with the County to officiate my brother's wedding later that month. We were going to make it a girl's day and go to the casino and like always when we drive south (usually to Texas not to small Oklahoma towns), we stop in Davis Oklahoma to visit the chocolate factory. All of our stops were a quick jump off of Interstate-35. We planned on getting chocolate first, then file paperwork, then head south to the casino. We took I-35 and never made it to Davis Oklahoma. We never passed through the beautiful Arbuckle Mountains and we most definitely didn't pass by the field of windmills that are always so noteworthy. We assumed we got our towns out of order as we arrived in Ardmore and took care of business. When we left Ardmore we headed south and made it to the casino. But we were shocked when we got there because we expected to hit Davis first. What happened to the scenic Arbuckle Mountains and the big wind turbine farm? You can't argue with logic. We must have been mistaken. The Casino must not have been as far South as we thought. We kept driving knowing in our guts we didn't pass Davis or the mountains but also knowing we were about to enter Texas. We got off the highway and turned around. We passed the Casino again, drove past Ardmore, and eventually drove through the long stretch of Arbuckle Mountains, the fields of windmills and Davis Oklahoma. We never stopped for chocolate. We were so freaked out because we knew we didn't drive through this going South but we HAD to have passed it to make it to Ardmore. It's not something you can just miss in the blink of an eye. There were at least 30 minutes that we can't account for. We drove by landmarks that we knew and would have remembered. We felt the shock of driving through this stretch and commenting on how beautiful it was compared to the city and the rest of the dry and flat state. You always get this feeling when you drive through. It feels like you're in Arkansas, not Oklahoma. So when we finally drove through, supposedly for the second time, it was a shock. We were never so lost in conversation that we would have missed the part of the state we looked forward to seeing as we escaped the city. We laughed eventually and promised not to tell anyone because we would sound crazy but we both knew something happened that could not be explained.",0
Anxiety or real abduction?,"Several times a week, I’ll wake up 2 hours after dozing off. In pure panic. Disoriented. Skin feels hot to the touch. Feeling extremely fearful like something is wrong. One particular night, I had this happen , and I walked to the kitchen and felt like I was being watched. Almost like moving through a crowd. I could feel the energy and presence of people around me. But nobody was there.

A couple nights ago I woke up suddenly, like I was in danger. And it usually takes me a while to fall back to sleep. But then I’m fine. 

I have seen a UFO in the past when I was much much younger.
And sometimes I’ll wake up feeling extremely groggy like I’ve been drugged. It’s always unsettling for me. And it’s almost impossible for me to wake up. I’ve not had any sleep paralysis, either.

From The Super Natural by Whitley Strieber and Jeffrey J. Kripal,"“As Jacques Vallée has taught us in his own books, if a form of mind wanted to really influence, shape, or direct a culture, it would not bother with the culture’s public arguments or politics. It would choose to work on the culture’s deepest operating system. It would go to the place of dreams and vision. It would choose to work on the cultural imagination.""",0
“Missing 411” movie; what is it implying that took these kids?,"The movie never says, but reading between the lines it seems like they’re saying something paranormal (aliens, bigfoot, other) is the reason. I wonder if you all know more about it.",0
Not sure what’s happened,"I don’t know much about abductions because the more I look into it the more it creeps me out but I’ve definitely not been one to miss out on my own personal alien experiences and my own paranormal experiences so part of me believes that I could’ve been abducted.

A few weeks ago I woke up with a long cut to the left of my shin almost as if it was cut by a sharp object. This morning I woke up with the same exact cut just an inch to the right of the original cut. I have no idea how either of them have got there and what’s weird is that they’re the exact same length on the same position if my leg... anyways I thought I’d post this to see what you guys would say about it I don’t know if I’m being paranoid or if it’s an actual abduction",0
Usually known as the HatMan but I believe there's more to it,"When I was four years old I was laying in bed, and I saw light coming through the window above my bed (window was facing back yard) and I thought it was weird that there was a street light in my backyard. I stood up on my bed and looked out the window and there it was, he must have been 7 feet tall, wearing a trenchcoat and a big brimmed hat. I couldn't see any details because he was pure black and the light coming from up above behind him made it harder to see. Even though I couldn't see his face I could feel him staring at me and communicating with me in my mind. I don't know what was being said but I had this feeling where my adrenaline was being suppressed and I was so calm but I didn't want to be. My dog that always slept in the bed with me ran and hid under the bed, from that night forward my dog would only sleep under the bed.  When I was finally able to I broke out of whatever was happening and ran to my Mom in the living room. I told her what was happening and she went to bed with me.

The next morning my older brother called my Mom, we were living in Texas and my brother (23/24 years old at the time) was living in Minnesota. He asked if everyone was okay. I had almost never talked to or seen my brother at that point and didn't really know him. He told us that last night he was taken from his place and he was in a room that looked like it was completely stainless steel and there were no lights but the walls were emitting light. He said there was a metal bench and my mom and sister (about 19 years old and lived up the street from me at the time) was there and crying hysterically. The HatMan was in the room and another being was doing something to my Mom and she was in pain. My brother stood up and the HatMan grabbed him by the throat and lifted him off the ground. My brother then proceeded to stick his thumb in the HatMans eye (he described the eye as big and and black, kind of insectoid but it seemed more like it was some sort of a contact) and then two other beings came in the room and had a metallic pipe in their hands. The HatMan put my brother down and the other beings put one of the metal pipes to his side and shocked him and he lost consciousness. He later woke up in his duplex. 

Later that day my brother stopped by my Grandma's apartment and she was pissed at my uncle that was living with her at the time because he ""came home drunk and broke her coffee table."" He told her that he was laying on the couch and saw the HatMan standing at the end of the couch, my uncle then got up and went to attack it and the HatMan grabbed him by the throat, lifted him up and dropped him on the coffee table and disappeared. My uncle had bruises all the way around his neck and it looked like Andre the Giant choked him out. 

This was the most terrifying moment of my life and as I write this I feel sick to my stomach and like I am crawling out of my skin. Though he is called the HatMan by many, I've always referred to him as Nightmare because that's how I feel about him.",0
Anyone remember seeing something oddly specific before being 'abducted'?,"I don't believe any of you nor my friend, but he told me about when he thought he was abducted, and he saw something right before which he remembered clearly. Wasnt anything totally unusual but it was specific enough for him to remember clearly. Wondering if any of you saw something too, what was it? I'll reveal what it was in my friend's story later but I want to see if anyone else's description matches first.",0
I think I was abducted when I was a baby,"I haven't really thought about this since about a week ago.

I learned to talk, walk, read and stuff like that at a much younger age than normal. I've always been obsessed with UFO's and my mom said I started talking about ""Lights in the sky"" when I was two years old. I also have a fear of grey aliens? 

What do you guys think?",0
Visited/abducted in my room with ex gf right next to me,"So this is kind of fucked to talk about as it still makes me feel very on edge.

A few years ago, I was in bed with my ex whom lived with me. We were getting ready to go to bed, and doing the normal whatever-the-fuck people do; I.e, read, talk, think, etc. It got to the point that I was tired enough to turn the bedroom light off(I always have another light on in a room that can shine into the bedroom, and leave the door cracked)

So, I must have fallen asleep around 2am or so. I wake suddenly with the most unsettling feeling I've ever had, and immediately my entire attention is glued to the door, from what feels like an outside force or extreme intuition of knowing something is happening. My body begins to shake, and I can feel my heart dropping into my body, ala what I assume people feel in situations of grave danger/complete fearful uncertainty. I have this innate feeling that something is coming to the door. I just know with my entirety that it's happening. 

The longer it goes on, the more this horrendous feeling grows. I see the door starting to open slowly, and that's when the absolute paralyzing feeling engrossed me. I see what I can only describe as the most terrifyingly obscene ""creature"" or ""thing"" walking into the room towards me. It was very large, with bulbous arms, and head that's directly connected to the torso, no neck, a very wide chest, and gangly legs that are still decently thick. The mere sight of this sends my brain into unfathomable panic, as I can't even register what the fuck it is. I've never seen anything in any movie, show, cartoon, drawing, etc, that is anywhere close to what this was. My brain still has a very vague idea of what it looked like, because it was outside my realm of perception for my brain to fill in the blanks that my vision doesn't hold. 

It walks towards me, and without speaking, fills my head with the most disgusting, painful fear I can imagine. I remember looking over to my then gf and seeing she's completely asleep. I try and nudge her, which is already very hard due to paralysing panic, but nothing works. It eventually gets right up to me and outstretched it's arms and grabbed me. Then, everything was black, a sheer conscious memory of nothing but complete void in memory, sight, feeling, what have you.

I come back to around 4/5am, drenched in sweat with the exact same fear I was experiencing, but now back in bed. I had pain all over and felt as if I had been drugged, that delirious type foggy feeling, with the pain of memory loss, knowing that time and events aspired and I have no recollection. At that moment she wakes up and asks what's wrong, and I don't say anything then because I'm in disbelief and just genuinely afraid to even say it out loud, as I wanted to pretend it was all fake.

I've talked about it maybe a few times, but it's incredibly disheartening to speak out loud, and to think about. I still get that same feeling sometimes at night, and it really fucks me up. But nothing sense then has happened to that degree. I am 100% sure it wasn't a dream. There were signs of a disturbance and shit that didn't add up from when we laid down, there were marks on my body and blood on my side of the bed. Not a lot, but enough to notice without examining thoroughly.

Sorry this is so long, it's hard to articulate because I've never typed it out. If anyone has had a similar experience and wants to share, please do. I've read a lot of different experiences and none explain anything to what I saw and what I presumably was taken by for a few hours. I'm not gonna tldr this because I don't know how to compress it. I've thought about regression hypnosis or something to try and remember, but honestly I don't think I want to relive that

Edit: I say ""must have fallen asleep around 2am"" because that's when I generally fell asleep then, and I remember looking at my phone's clock and it saying 1:55am before I set it on my nightstand",0
possible abduction? a dream within a dream,"last night i had a dream that bothered me so much, i made an account just to document it and see what people think. i've believed in and associated myself with extraterrestrials since I was a child, to a pretty obsessive degree, and although I experience near-constant synchronicities and ""glitches"", i never felt like i've experienced abduction until recently.It started about a week ago, when shortly after waking up i noticed two tiny dots tattooed symmetrically on one of the knuckles of my left hand (will try to include a photo below). i'm an observant person and i stare at my hands constantly, so I was completely shocked, where did they come from? I have a lot of tattoos but I did none around this area of my hand. I felt incredibly uneasy about it. I also woke up in tremendous pain, especially in the back of my neck. I joked with my wife, oh my god i've been abducted. I wish I could remember what I dreamt about that night. Since that day I've felt incredibly weak, like my physical energy has been drained. I've also been having vivid dreams all week, a lot of them involving my deceased loved ones.

Last night, I had a dream I was in my childhood home, except there was a large body of water next to it. I looked out the window and saw a massive, disc shaped UFO hovering above the house across the street. A huge beam of light was descending from it. I called my roommate to the window, asking her if she saw it too, and she said yes, this is real. The aircraft seemed to realize we could see it,because it shrunk down to a much smaller size and started flying into our window, like it was trying to get into the house. I was so scared that I jumped into bed and hid under the covers. after that, I remember small glimpses of greys, I would open my eyes and it was obvious to me that I was laying on an operating table, they was a few of them, typical greys, staring down at me with their big eyes. but it was so hazy, like i was under anesthesia, and as soon as they noticed I was waking they'd make sure to put me back under. then i ""woke up"" (still dreaming) in the same bed I was hiding in, and for the rest of the dream I was hysterically telling everyone i'd see, I've been abducted i've been abducted! It was so vivid, I can see the imagery of it all crystal clear in my mind.When I woke up for real, I had the worst headache of my life. I get headaches fairly often but I've never just woken up with a headache like that, it usually comes from staring at the screen too long or something. The dream was fresh in my mind and I lay there in agony, thinking oh my god, I've been abducted and the radiation gave me this headache. The pain was severe. eventually I worked up the strength to get out of bed and take 4 ibuprofen, then eventually fell back asleep... woke up again a few hours later, still thinking about my previous dream. when I got out of bed, I noticed two spots just under my left knee where my skin had been scraped off (will also try to include a photo of this). Like I said, I've had no energy all week, so I've barely even gotten out of bed, I have no idea how I would've skinned my knee, and in two symmetrical circular shapes? and I know for a fact these were not there yesterday, it is very obviously a fresh wound...apart from that, I feel even more drained today, like I can hardly even stand up. my whole body aches and I almost fainted in the shower. don't really know what's the point of me posting this here, a friend suggested I do so. also, I don't know if this makes any difference, but i've been staying in new mexico the past few months. I have a wife who was asleep next to me the entire time I was having this dream.

I also had an extremely vivid dream a few months ago where I was standing next to a large body of water with a dock leading into it. under the dock I saw the large eyes of animals that appeared to be bears, wolves and cougars, all staring at me. then a large cat-like animal came out from under the dock and transformed into a tall nordic-looking woman. we had a long conversation but I can't remember anything she said to me. When I woke up, I knew it had been some kind of visitation, but I'm not sure what it meant. It felt like she was trying to awaken something within me. The next day, I had two unnerving encounters with strangers that I intuitively feel were reptilians. One of them literally hissed at me. It was the strangest thing. new mexico creeps me the hell out but I love it here.

for more context, I am a very spiritual person and always have been, i've been obsessed with the stars and specifically astrology since I first learned to read. I believe in god, jesus, atlantis, the illuminati, 5D ascension, guardian angels, past lives, heaven, hell, you name it, I probably believe in it and have studied it. I am almost 27 years old. I would love to hear some feedback on this dream and if anyone's had similar experience. Also going to try and post the pictures in the comments. Thanks for reading :)

Has anyone ever compiled the medical/miscarriage records of abductee women?,"It seems the the best physical evidence (for modern science) of the physical reality of abductions would be a collection of medical records from the many women who have claimed to have had their fetuses removed a few months into pregnancy.

Why hasn’t there been any solid high-quality video evidence of aliens?,"“I had the impression that this object could foresee what I was thinking. This is an experience that has changed me for the rest of my life,” says Captain Jorge Polanco, one of the witnesses in the 1955 Bariloche Incident [(see Supplementary Video)](https://youtu.be/bizD8EBvTNg?t=226).

If UFOs already possess the technology to dwarf the jets of the U.S. Navy, they most likely have the data on recent man-made technologies like the internet and smartphones. Now, with smartphones, internet, and surveillance cameras everywhere, even one very clear video of an alien encounter and UFO landing would equate to official contact. To put it simply, we lack close-up footage of UFOs because that is not what they want us to see. 

Thus, assuming that these aliens may be choosing not to contact us for now, one might wonder why they chose to appear before [some](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-wales-south-west-wales-38835991/broad-haven-pupil-s-ufo-sightings-marked-40-years-on) [children](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/22/AR2007032202132.html) in rural areas in the past. A logical guess as to why these aliens might have appeared to children but not to professionals with credentials might have to do with Earth’s own internal level of development. Specifically, if such alien encounters were to happen to a notable person, it would disrupt the person’s original “intended” course of life. Specifically, they might have become **ufologists** instead of achieving feats in their relevant field as an aftermath of a life-changing experience. All things considered, if aliens are making any contact with us, they want to minimize their impact on humanity while gradually helping us realize that we are not alone. 

Nevertheless, in recent years, UFOs appeared in front of U.S. Navy pilots to the point where the Navy and Pentagon were officially forced to acknowledge their existence. The United States had effectively denied the existence of UFOs until now. Its sudden change in stance has rendered government agencies questionable and suspicious in the eyes of the general public. To me, it seems these UFOs are aware of humanity’s censorship of alien life, and they are not “comfortable” with the [**elites**](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/10/jeffrey-epstein-trump-clinton-friends) or [**media corporations**](https://www.quora.com/Why-would-I-think-Pizzagate-is-real) currently [**governing**](https://youtu.be/aEvpZ8SM9L4?t=459) [**mankind**](https://youtu.be/SiX71WIpsK0?t=29).",0
Something happened while camping.,"It’s been almost 10 years since this happened, but I still can’t really understand it and honestly it makes me uncomfortable to recount the story. I was telling someone this story over the weekend and they suggested I try to find if anyone else had a similar experience. So, here I am. 

I went camping in a pretty remote location in the foothills of Tennessee, USA, and the first night we (my gf at the time but now my wife and I) arrived at the campsite it was late at night and already dark. There were 4-5 other couples there already and they had set up our tent for us. This was my first time visiting the campsite. We sat around the campfire for 15-20 minutes talking with the host and then went to bed because it was pretty late. That night “something” happened. 

I had an experience that I can best describe as a dream. In this experience I “woke up” in the middle of a clearing in the woods with my wife. We were both drowsy, and she was more or less incapacitated as if she was sedated. I was drowsy but also in a full panic of fear feeling as if we were being chased or “trying to escape” or something like that. I grabbed her under the arm and was sort of dragging/walking across this clearing towards a group of tents. The sky was sort of foggy and gray so I had a little bit of visibility, and I could make out some very clear features about the area; a pond, a cleared area with trees all around, a basketball hoop attached to a tree, groups of tents, etc. I was able to drag her back to the tent and lay down.

Thats’s when I actually woke up. Terrified. Our tent did not have a rain fly so I could see out the top of the tent into the trees and sky. I saw a circular object with six circular lights in a circular pattern hovering just over the trees. The craft made no noise at all. I laid there completely paralyzed, and after a few moments the craft sort of just flew off and out of sight. I laid in the tent completely scared for a long time, trying to make sense of what I was thinking and feeing. I was able to finally go back to sleep.

The next morning we woke up and I saw the campsite for the first time. It was exactly like I had seen in my experience... even down to the detail of the basketball hoop nailed to a tree. Again, I had some very strong and strange feelings after recognizing those surroundings from my “dream”. 

We didn’t stay the next night, and I told my gf the story on the drive home the next day. Fortunately she didn’t/doesn’t think I am crazy. I still can remember that event as vividly as if it happened yesterday. 

I am curious if there are others with a similar experience.",0
Question about abductions.,"I have never been or hope to be abducted.

I do belive alot of storys when i lurk on this sub and appreciate the telling of your experiences.

But 1 question i always wanted to know but never seen a answer to.

Any of you who have been abducted, do you have any dogs? Weather it be guard dogs or just pets. If so do they react? Are they sleeping in the room or outside during the encounter? What do they do ect?

 If not dogs any other animal that would cause a scean if anything were to enter the area.",0
Need help/insights anything you may have experienced or witnessed before.,"Where to even start...

This happened about a week ago.
So let me paint the picture for you all I am in bed like any other regular night trying to calm my mind after a day at work and get some rest before I go to work in the morning again. I wake up tossing and turning around 2ish when I hear some strange noises outside and I think nothing of it but have the urge to use the bathroom so I go and do my business and return to my bedroom to still hear these noises. My best description of the sound would be that of a drone that kids would play with but with a sort of neon noise to it. It reminded me of something off of Tron the movie and the noises the vehicles made mixed with a toy drone. I have never heard anything quite like that before so I take a look out my window and come to the realization that this noise if coming directly above my apartment building and I see a slight glow of yellow light coming from above I can not see anything and decide to go downstairs and look from my patio. Upon coming outside the noise drastically got more faint as the yellowish light brightened and turned into more of a white/led light before making an unbearably loud static like noise mixed with that of an EMP noise from a movie or something. This made my eardrums feel as if they were on fire and the pain brought me to my knees and the light continued to brighten an then enclosed around me. As if a super massive flashlight was being shined on me and then the blast of noise hit me once again but louder and I blacked out or fainted or passed out. I did not see any craft or anything above me except for the faint yellow glow which then turned in a spotlight that focused on me after I was brought to my knees. It felt like a weapon being targeted at me more than anything else and those were the thoughts that had gone through my head before I blacked out.

Now the unexplainable.

Upon waking up I was slightly disoriented and found myself in a room and the walls were like a cream white and it was very bright but there was no source from which the light was coming. It was as if the walls themselves were the light source and they were lit up from within. At this point I am started to get anxious and very nervous as well as scared. The next thing I know a rectangle in the wall makes a compression noise like it is releasing pressure and begins to open up. This is no regular door as it opened downward like an upside down garage and the “alien” “specimen” I’m not sure what came through the door after opening but it was around 4 1/2 feet tall? No body hair and no hair at all on it but a larger then normal head accompanied by two eyes that reminded me of a praying mantis’s eyes and a small mouth with teeth like a whales it looked like straw teeth as it slightly grinned as it entered the room. This thing scared the hell out of me and was like nothing I have ever seen. It had a piece of glass in its hand which I assumed to be an information tablet/monitor. I stood there in disbelief and felt a paralyzed feeling go throughout my body I couldn’t move if I wanted and my thoughts were racing beyond measure. My breathing increased and I felt as if I was having an anxiety attack that is when I realized how “pure” the air was. 

(Side note my gf works at a hospital as a respiratory therapist.)

This air felt like it was 100% oxygen which I have taken before through a mask at a hospital. I notice my limbs start to tingle and I focus on my breathing and begin to relax. The alien figure then looks at me from head to toe and nods and  waves it hand but not like a hello toward me but more of a begin. It took me a second but I realized that it had only 3 fingers and a thumb and I noticed three dots on its palm that were a significantly darker shade of grey compared to the rest of its lighter grey skin tone. 

This is where things begin to get odd. The colors of the walls start to fade into different shades of red, blue, purple, orange, green, then to black and white continuously. They started to fade slowly then sped up as the “cycle” completed. The thing is overtime the colors changed so did my emotions and I couldn’t help but look straight into the eyes of the thing in front of me. I felt unbearable hate toward this thing during one cycle in which I wanted to murder and mutilate it in the most gruesome and horrible way I could think of. On another cycle I felt so happy and filled with joy as if I was on a drug of some sort and I wanted to approach the thing in front of me and dance and hold its hand. I felt almost as if I was on drugs during some cycles. I was just standing there unable to move and unable to look away from this thing in front of me for what felt like hours. On one cycle I felt a deep pain from within as if I had lost a loved one and I was in extreme phycological pain. The worst I could ever experience as if all my loved ones were gone from the world. My mind was getting physically tired from experiencing all of these emotions and stress that I began to feel unable to stay awake. After another cycle had gone through and the colors faded from one to another it stayed on white and got so extremely bright that I couldn’t see anything at all and I was being blinded. Like staring into the sun except it was a bright white light like an led. It began to fade and get less bright when I noticed the thing in front of me was now gone. After a short period the light began to fade ever so slowly until it was the darkest I’ve ever experienced. It reminded me of a dark room in highschool that the art teachers would use for photos except it was darker. It was like being in a black hole it was the darkest thing I’d ever experienced. That is when I fainted or blacked out again and I awoke to find my self inside my apartment again with the patio door closed and me facing away from it. I didn’t know what to think and returned to bed. I thought of many different explanations and nothing made sense and I couldn’t help but think of what happened before passing out from exhaustion only to wake up the next morning and feel very disoriented and ended up calling of work as I need the day to try and make sense of what I had just experienced.

I don’t even know how to explain this and I feel and sound like I am a crazy person and writing this out feels so odd. To put this whole thing into words and post is unusual. I have read and looked throughout this sub and a couple others and can’t seem to find anyone else with similar experiences as mine. I feel like they tested my emotional capabilities with the lights and in that room I’ve never felt anything like that. It is indescribable and I just need assurance I’m
Not going completely insane. I’ve gone to the doctor recently and they prescribed me anxiety meds that I still need to pick up but otherwise checked out fine on everything else. 

Can anyone help explain this or have anything similar happen to you or anyone you know anything can help me make this make sense in my head.

Thank you and stay safe folks.",0

Possible abduction involving timeline manipulation,"The only things I remember are having been in bed at night as a little kid and seeing from my bedroom window our nextdoor neighbor's house on fire with a spaceship having crashed into it, tubes with liquid going through them which I believed was being injected into me and was a bad thing, and observing from a seamless first, second, and third person perspective my spirit descending ""back"" into my body. The neighbor's house was unaffected when I checked afterward, so if it wasn't a dream, which it didn't feel like it was, then either time was reversed, or the ""aliens"" took me out of that timeline and placed me in this one.",0
I’m probably crazy,"Ok I am probably just crazy. I need to start back when I was a kid, I used to love anything scary including aliens. It never bothered me. I am not sure when but at some point I got a very irrational fear of aliens. Some may even call it a phobia, this carried to adulthood. I watched the 4th kind at one point and couldn't sleep for days. I was so afraid all the time. I couldn't even look up at the sky I would go into a panic attack. Then one day last year I awoke with a memory. I can say dream because dreams move and you do stuff in them. In this memory it was almost like looking at a picture. I could see a little ways in front of me we will say 4 yards or so. Was an extremely tall being, I only knew it was y'all bc it was siting in an all metal chair and I was standing below it and I still looked up at it. With this memory was such a strong feeling, like trust or happiness. I couldn't see anyone or anything else there but I could feel the presence of others nearby. But now my fear is gone, completely gone. That's the most astonishing thing to me. After a little googling what I saw mostly looks like insectoid alien.",0

Possible abduction (Missing time) and other experiences.,"Throughout my life i've had some really weird experiences. I'll share some of my experiences. 

I woke up, I was fully awake. No paralysis. I sat up and to my left looking over me was a black shadow figure. Humanoid looking, but just jet black. I stood up to it and asked, "" what are you?"" It was then after that question that I froze up and became terrified. Like an animal caught in headlights. A too scared to move sensation. I blacked out. I woke up standing in the corner of my room. About 5 hours had past by. I don't remember a thing. It was just blank. 

I also want to share another recent experience. This was about a year or so ago. I woke up to this ""black cloud"" that was sprawled out like a blanket over me and my girlfriend. It was jet black and looked like a weird liquid/gas material. My initial reaction was to try and point at it. The part i tried pointing at moved back, avoiding being touched. It then started rolling together and moving in a gaseous/liquid like fashion towards the cieling. It moved like it was alve. Midway to the cieling i woke my girlfriend up and she watched if with me. It sprawled out over the cieling and just vanished.  I made sure my girlfriend gave me all the details of what i saw before i told her anything and it was all right on. This experience was important to me because i now know there is infact alien life. What its doing, where its from, i dont know. 

I reached out to another redditer that had the same experience as me. He even went on to say fhat he tried punching it, and it moved back, like when i tried to point at it. He lives in the same city as I do. 

I have other experiences with orbs of light in very close proximity. My gilfriend has seen the red orange orb of light i saw as a kid. My girlfriend has never had an experience before she met me. My father and his wife and my grandparents have seen the red orbs. 

As a kid i also had a ""poltergeist"" experience. I was in a room watching ed edd and eddy. The tv turned off, light switched flipped down, and door slammed shut. Pitch black in the room. I went to the door to try and open it and it was if someone was holding the door handle, not letting me open it. After about 20 seconds i was able to get out.

I just wanted to vent some of my experiences. I feel like i am being watched throughout my life like some experiment. 

I feel alienated from others because of these experiences. Some people say i'm crazy, and the religious say that these are demons. I believe i have ptsd from all these experiences but i feel like i have healed I think... i do have severe anxiety issues. But its like i dont even care anymore. I can sleep without the door barricaded open. My girlfriend on the other hand, cannot sleep without the light on, without youtube playing, or the cat or someone with her. She was never like this before.

Its my personal belief that these are intelligent beings. What they want i have no clue.

Just wanted to vent.",0
THE MOST INSPIRING STORY EVER - David Goggins (Eye Opening Speech) | Quite Motivation,0,0
Was this a dream?,"Hey guys, I already posted this on another subreddit, because I didn't know this one, so if you could help me out with this dream, I'd really appreciate it. I had it a couple of years ago, and till today nobody believes me. First of all, I'm sorry about my English, it isn't my first language.

So, in this dream, I ""woke up"" laying on a reclinable kind of chair, to see a super luminous white kind of room, all the walls where white, and so was the furniture (there were like drawers chests and stuff like that). And then, I saw a woman (I felt she was a woman, but I couldn't really tell, it was just a white/greyish body not so glowy like the room, and very tall), she turned back, looked at me and smiled (again, I felt like she smiled at me, but she didn't have an actual face, just the head, slimmer than our kind of head, but no eyes or mouth or anything). Then she ""greeted me"", and then she approached to me and ""said"" ""don't worry, it'll be quick"" or something like that; I put everything between quotation marks because you couldn't see her talking, because like I said, there wasn't a mouth, but I could hear her in my head, I don't know, it was really weird, but I felt really safe there, and comfortable.
Next thing I know, I felt like a pinch on the ¿back? of my elbow (the place where you get your blood drawn), and I saw how a test tube, right next to the chair I was in, was instantly filled with my blood. The woman ""thanked me"", everything went black, and I woke up (for real this time) on my bed. I looked at where I had felt the pinch, and I had a really little red dot. I should have had taken a picture of it, but my phone back then couldn't really catch it. 

And that's it, I googled it a million times but I never found anything. I use to have dreams, but I don't usually remember them after a certain time. 

Could I have been abducted? What do you think?

"I had a dream, maybe not. I'm not sure","Had a dream last night, maybe it wasn't. I was standing on the driveway of my house (I was actually standing in the same spot yesterday afternoon) and I saw what looked like a transparent round object coming down from the sky.

As it got closer to the ground, it wasn't transparent anymore, it was changing color (kind of the image you see on the old TVs while changing the channel) when it actually landed I realized this was a UFO - The typical disk like with the dome on the top, it was metal gray color. I remember thinking ""what is that?"" And when it landed I kind of thought ""its happening, its the aliens"" 

For some reason I immediately look to my left and there was a short gray alien, big head and big eyes. Next thing I remember is laying in some type of bed or chair, kind of leaning back. I felt like gravity was holding me to the bed/chair and I couldn't move (kind of when a plane is taking off and you feel stuck to your chair) 

At this moment my though was ""they are taking me"". I then felt my legs opening up apart while I was laying down and I thought the gravity force was doing this but I immediately realized someone was opening up my legs to look at my crotch/anus area. At this point I anticipated pain so I screamed so hard but no sound came out. At this point I woke up on my bed.

I want to point out I never felt pain. I am not sure if this was a dream or not. It felt so real",0

My Experiences,"As a child I was terrified of aliens. Movies, television, any form of media depicting extraterrestrials , specifically greys, was extremely disturbing to me. Despite my fears, I cannot recall an outright abduction experience. I do, however, remember three odd occurrences in childhood that have stuck with me. 

The first occurrence happened when I was about five years old. It was the afternoon and I was napping on my parents bedroom. My parents bedroom was a fairly large room and was arranged in a way in which the bed was on the wall opposite of the door leading into the hallway. I recall waking up lying in the corner on my side against the wall near the door. My head was situated in an awkward angle against the wall. I remember awakening and feeling confused and frightened. I fumbled with the doorknob and went to be with my parents. I don’t recall if I told them. The bed was too far away from the wall for me to have fallen out of bed. I could have been sleepwalking but I do not have a history of this but I suppose it’s possible. Seems benign as I type it but I’ve always remembered this with unease.

The second occurrence I remember occurred at roughly the same age. It was nighttime and I was once again in my parents bed. My grandpa has come from out of town to visit us and was with my parents in the living room. I remember wanting to stay up as I was excited that my grandpa was in town. I was restlessly lying in bed unable to sleep when I saw something that frightened me. My parent’s room was attached to the master bathroom. As I was scared to sleep in the dark my parents had left the bathroom light on for me. The bathroom door was closed but the was enough of a gap between the floor and the door to provide enough of a night light. I saw what I perceived to be two shadows/figures obscuring the light. I perceived these figures as being inside of the bathroom, pacing back and forth. I don’t recall getting my parents and assume I either feel asleep.

The third childhood occurrence was in the form of a dream. My other grandparents live on a ranch. In my dream I was outside with my grandfather, holding his hand. My grandfather was leading my to a large disk like craft that was on the ground in the pasture in front of the ranch house. We entered the craft and I recall sitting down on bench in dimly lit humid room. I didn’t see anyone or anything else-just my grandfather. During the “dream” my grandfather never spoke or acknowledged me aside from leading me to the craft. I remember feeling bizarre and confused-sort of off when I awoken.

As an adult, I have had a recurring bizarre experience. This occurrence approximately every few months and actually happened last week. The occurrence is as follows- I wake up early morning hours and feel a presence. Mentally I always think grey but I have never seen them in this scenario. I feel frighten and sometimes feel a ringing or buzzing in my ear that resonates into my mandible. As soon as it begins it’s over and I feel an intense itching on my forearms and shins. Usually I fall asleep after this and wake up in the morning without further incident. However last time, as I was itching, I distinctly heard a door in the house creak as if someone had moved it. Oddly my wife recalls hearing the noise as well.

I don’t know if I am dreaming or am misremembering. I hold a professional job and have a loving family. I have a great life but have always felt something else was going on with me. Almost like I’m supposed to know something that I can’t connect the dots. I was actually considering hypnosis but admittedly I need to research this more. I am mostly a lurker but after reading so many other accounts I felt compelled to share. What are your thoughts?",0
Alien abduction or realistic dream?,"First off let me make a note that I am a very light sleeper, any little noise can wake me up and I'm usually always very conscious of my surroundings even while sleeping. I don't fall into really deep sleeps. But I've had many sleep paralysis experiences but they've never involved aliens and my sleep paralysis lasts very long and happens multiple times during my episodes. But I haven't had sleep paralysis in about 2 years, so I don't think the experience I had last night was sleep paralysis at all, but it hardly seemed like a dream either. I've always believed we can't be alone and I've had many ufo sighting experiences, and I've always believed people could have been abducted by aliens. I've seen ufo's and used to have scary dreams of them too. But last night is the first time anything like this has ever happened to me and I wanna say it's a dream, I'm just not sure. So maybe you guys can give me an opinion. So my experience last night was this: I'm asleep, it's the middle of the night probably 1 or 2 am. I sleep with my bf and as said before I'm a light sleeper and usually wake up at random times and look around the room. Well I remember waking up at one point and I wasn't in our room anymore, and I could not move my head, seemed like only my head was immobilized and in my peripheral vision (and I can't believe I'm saying this, cause I believe but never wanted to see one for real) I see a grey figure standing behind me, so my head is like stuck like in a vice or something and I'm looking behind me at a grey figure looking back at me. I don't feel like I'm laying in bed, surface feels harder. And the thing that makes this so real, and makes me question it being a dream is the fact that I hear a drill right by my left ear, looking at this grey creature. The drill noise is super loud, deafening. I heard it guys. And it made me want to scream. It seemed like this only happened for a few minutes. And then when I jolted awake, I was back in my room in my bed with my bf. I am always aware of my bf's presence in bed. So for me to feel like I'm somewhere else with another being and a drill next to my ear and my head is locked in place, is very unsettling to me. I've had sleep paralysis enough to know this is different and can tell if something was just a bad dream. But this, this was just different and troubling. To top it off and make it even more scary and questionable to be a dream is the fact that I woke up with a severe headache, nauseous,  sore body (like post workout sore), light-headed,  feverish feeling and sweaty ( I hardly ever sweat, specially first thing in the morning).  I've felt off all day, headache and nausea eventually went away but been light -headed majority of the day. It's just not normal for me to have all those symptoms at once and overnight? After having a ""dream"" like that? Idk I REALLY want it to be a dream guys.. help me out. If it wasn't a dream, I really don't want it to happen again. If someone has truly think they've dealt with abduction, how can it prevented, or can it even be prevented? Doesn't seem like we have much control and if anyone even did believe, what could anyone do? That's what's scary about accepting truth about aliens existing and abductions happening,is that we have no control and are powerless over the situation. Which is why we all just say, ""it was a dream."" Right?",0
"Here's my ""was this an abduction"" story.","So I've been sitting on this for years but now I'm getting curious. 

Basically, as a very young kid, I have had this reoccurring dream. I am on or near the beach where there is a huge structure set up in the sand- like it has all of these tubes and things, bright colors. As if you took the inside of a Chuck-E. Cheese and stuck it on a beach at night. I'm always near or inside the structure, scared, and running away from 3-4 figures that really match with what look like greys. They were always wearing silver clothes and stood maybe a foot or so taller than I was- so maybe 3.5-4 ft tall. Two are running from behind me and trying to get me to stop when one steps out in my path and I do stop. They don't feel mean but I don't want to be there and always feel scared, even though they seem to be trying to calm me down. Then I would wake up. I had that dream for years and as an adolescent, it stopped. 

As a kid, I was very into aliens and other strange stuff when I got older, and I used to be so, so scared of being out under the sky at night. We would go camping and I just remember for a period feeling so vulnerable when sitting exposed to the sky- like there was nowhere to run to and hide if anything were to show up. 

I went through normal teenage years but recently in the past 5 years since I've turned 18 shit has gotten a little weird. I keep waking up in the middle of the night panicking- full-on heart beating, terrified sweating, so scared that I don't move (although I can- it's not sleeping paralysis). There is an overwhelming feeling that something is nearby and coming to get me, that I can't see but it is close and every time this happens it feels familiar, like ""oh shit this again"". There's no pattern to when or where this happens- being in college sometimes it has been at y house, other times it's been in my dorm. It has not happened for the brief time I was overseas for a few months. It's awful but somehow shortly after I always end up falling asleep. Sometimes I try willing away whatever I feel is near. Once or twice I've heard weird sounds outside, like light metallic clanking, that I immediately associate as being connected to what's happening. I don't remember anything in particular the mornings after these panic events. They never happen the day and, although I'm an anxious person, I've never experienced symptoms like this with a clear cause. 

I live on a strange rural campus and have seen some weird stuff in the past few years. Two meteorites burning up and breaking apart, two rown mountain lights (I don't live on that particular mountain but close by and it looks to be the same phenomenon), and, most terrifyingly, a little white creature at night that looked for all the world like a ""crawler"", which I didn't know was a common phenomenon- and my friend was there to witness it with me. All these sightings were localized in one field- a field that I also felt very strangely drawn to the woods of one night and almost went into before breaking out into terror and sprinting back to my dorm, panicked the rest of the night. 

Anyway, I try to be very rational about these things but putting everything together it's a bit weird. I continue to have the panic events and sometimes will have pseudo-dreams where it feels like I'm looking at the environments and occupants of other planets, but these are always enjoyable and never feel threatening. They could also be due just to being imaginative so I don't give those much stock even though they can be very highly detailed and seem like things I wouldn't consciously think of the weirdest thing in my life that I don't tell people often is that I don't really connect with the idea of being human. I feel like I'm not meant to be human and should be some sort of shapeshifter or something which I know sounds bizarre. But I have no sexual attraction to anyone- never have- and generally think of my own species poorly, kind of as gross and undesirable which seems... I don't know. Not great or normal. I'd accept what has happened to me and move on but I don't like that the experiences continue with no explanation or deeper insight so I don't know what to do. I just want to remember what happens after one of those panic periods so I can know if I'm just being crazy or if there's something to be said for it. Does anyone else find any of this to be familiar?",0

Just want to get this off my chest,"Been trying to tell myself this was a dream but I'm not so convinced anymore. Happened around 2012.

I'd been reading up on UFOs. I heard that if you want to see a UFO, and I did, then you just start watching the skies and eventually they'll take notice. So one night I wake up after a nap, it's 11:30pm, and I remember I'd been planning to do some stargazing because it was a clear night. 

... I don't think I would have been able to read the clock well enough to tell the time in a dream.

I look out my window and see a few satellites go by, and head out to the backyard to take a look.

I almost immediately see two UFOs fly overhead and I'm thrilled. Then one of them doubles back and I start getting uneasy.  It lands in my backyard. Looks like some 1950s sci-fi rocket ship. I'm pressed up against the side of my house and about ready to run back inside, but I convince myself to walk towards it because hey this is really happening and this is what I'd been looking for.

Some  alien comes out of the ship and I walk towards it. Bright yellow skin, white hair. Communicates telepathically. Tries to convince me it's peaceful but I can see its thoughts too and it's a liar. And I call it a liar. And then I start feeling extremely tired and heavy and pass out in my yard. I can feel the dew on my face. My last thought is that it was gonna be embarrassing when someone found me there in the morning.

And then I'm in my bed. Somehow I know it's 1:30am. And I'm paralyzed.  Get a feeling that the alien's there in the corner watching me. Pass out again.

Wake up later in the morning, 430am, and bolt straight up in bed while saying ""what the fuck was that?!"".  Was extremely uncomfortable the rest of the day.

"I have difficulty explaining my experience, feel like I need to share it to others","Hello all,

First I would like to say that I have been diagnosed as being bipolar 2 years ago, shortly after having strange dreams and hearing ""high frequency noises"". Even though I am diagnosed as mentally ill, I feel as if there are, from what I read, ""multidimensional beings"" involved and it is making me uncomfortable, mainly because I have no idea what is being done to my body and I suddenly started feeling anxiety.  I have never experienced it in my life until having these strange dreams/feeling like I'm being watched/etc - basically symptoms most experiencers exhibit. How ironic it is that we are made to look crazy and be called liars to the public, however I feel like there is a general reason for that. 

I have looked into people like Dolores Cannon and other individuals who have written books about the plan of extraterrestrials. Sadly, I feel as if no book will ever fully explain what these beings want with us, and I also feel as if we are being withheld information (and I think it's things we really don't want t know because imo the brain can only handle so much . I understand that we make ""contracts"" before coming here, but I am completely left in the dark, when I meditate I don't really receive any news on what is happening to my body. Since I mentioned it twice, I will list exactly what I have been going through body wise

I have been prescribed seroquel, and interestingly enough one of the symptoms that occur frequently with me are dry mouth. However, right before I go to sleep after taking it I suddenly feel as if there is something making it more difficult to breathe (?) kinda weird to suddenly happen literally right before sleeping. Not only that but if I close my eyes, I CAN see a little white ball sorta going away from my head, as if there is something being sucked away from me going somewhere I do not know. Also, I feel like there is something being done to my heart, when I close my eyes, I see an image/shadow of something that looks like a V, and the two sides (\\ and /) seem to move up and down in rhythm with my heartbeat. I woke up this morning feeling some pain in my heart, and it went away after a while. I also noticed that if I drink coffee (even decaf) I feel, well, gross. It's really difficult to explain.  


A couple of weeks ago I had a dream where I was laying in a bed and felt really sad and  people were watching me --- but I could not see them. I had the thought of ""don't stop drinking the coffee"" come in right before it ending, and then I woke up with an extremely dry mouth. Yes, I did drink coffee early on that day, but I find it odd that a dream would encourage me to drink coffee if that was what caused the dry mouth

I made this post because I wanted to get this off my chest, I need a community that can read and somehow understand the unknown without brushing me off to being ""mentally ill"". I do tell my therapist about extraterrestrials but I understand that they probably won't take this seriously. I also want to encourage others to speak their truth as well. It pains me to see that people are scared to express what they experience, mainly because they really cant' explain it in a way others will understand (people will always ask questions that you - the experiencer - cannot answer, this obviously dissuades people from even bothering with telling their story)

Another reason is because I want people to know that they are not alone. I know this is said often here, but oftentimes we face these things alone, surrounded by people who will never understand us, because eerily enough we are labeled as people who will probably ""make this up"" or ""we're crazy"" or ""if you don't know who is taking you or why, your post is fake"". Not true. Even though there are people who lie about this sadly (and I have no idea WHY anyone would lie about these things outside of money...) we need to support each other. I hope someone benefits off of knowing that you are not alone, and yes it can be very scary. Share your story folks because I feel like the more stories we have the more we can understand.",0

In vain the four innocents sought to vindicate themselves by saying that they were their own country-folk, *and had been carried away a short time since by miraculous men who had shown them unheard-of marvels, and had desired to give them an account of what they had seen.* The frenzied populace paid no heed to their defense, and were on the point of casting them into the fire, when the worthy Agobard, Bishop of Lyons, who having been a monk in that city had acquired considerable authority there, came running at the noise, and having heard the accusations of the people and the defense of the accused, gravely pronounced that both one and the other were false. That it was not true that these men had fallen from the sky, and that what they said they had seen there was impossible.

The people believed what their good father Agobard said rather than their own eyes, were pacified, set at liberty the four Ambassadors of the Sylphs, and received with wonder the book which Agobard wrote to confirm the judgement which he had pronounced.

Aliens? Probably Not,"This occured on the morning of April 15th 2020 between 4:50am and 5:03am 

I have had strange dreams, spiritual experiences, and one previous sleep paralysis experience. But I have never had an encounter with an alien, until now. But probably not. Let me explain...

My boyfriend usually works early before the sun comes up, and when he does, he makes sure to give me a kiss and say goodbye, briefly waking me up in the morning. I usually fall back asleep immediately, and wake up later in the day. This morning started the same, he kissed me and went off to work to be there by 5am. I roll over and plan to go to sleep.

The next moments I didn’t feel like I was asleep, but only laying down with my eyes closed. I rolled onto my back, which I never do if I’m planning to try and sleep, and started to feel an urge to call for something. It spills out of my mouth smoothly before I even notice what I’m saying. “Aliens?” I call out aliens the same way someone would call out to god or the universe. I have never done something like this before, nor ever planned to. I would probably look like an idiot. 

All of a sudden my eyes are half open to see a gray flexible creature slowly crawl onto my bed. It was about the size of a small dog, but trust me it looked nothing like a canine. From what I could tell, it had 4 limbs like a lizard. Parallel to the ground, bending at sharp angles. And it had a very unnaturally long neck. I have tried to look up pictures of what it looked like, maybe someone's art, or storyboard idea, but I have found nothing similar to what I saw. And I can not draw for shit so I’m sorry there’s no illustration for this story. Just imagine a four limbed worm like creature with a structural spine. Dull black claws of four digits at the ends of all its arms. It’s connective tissue was similar to an undersea creature, doughy and squishy. But it wasn’t slimy at all. Its skin was smooth like a hairless cat, or a dolphin. And it was strong, I could see its muscles in its back and limbs. It obviously had climbing abilities, and could cause destruction if it needed to. If it had eyes, they must have been thin because I didn’t see any, and no prominent nose that I can remember. 

It climbed up from the bottom of my bed to the side of my right hip. It sat for a little bit on all fours making sure I knew it was there and that I was comfortable. It put one hand on my hip and the other on top of my belly. Then suddenly its neck extended towards my exposed stomach and began sucking with its round circular mouth under my left set of ribs. I didn’t feel like it was taking my organs, but it was definitely penetrating through my skin and past my muscles into my body. It had teeth, but they were not biting me, they were mainly there to steady and support its head and position it was taking to work. I held its neck with both of my hands like I was holding onto a delicate railing. It felt like someone was taking a vacuum tube to my stomach, but it was going through my body. 

Like I said previously, I've had a sleep paralysis experience before, that story is for another day. But this was different, I wasn’t panicked, and I didn’t feel restricted. I was calm, so calm I didn't question what was happening. I felt like I was being cleansed, like it was taking something bad out of my body, or I was willingly giving away my nutrients. Looking back I felt as though there was a bond, like it was my pet. I called for something, and it came, so why question or deny it? I sat there for what felt like 3 or 4 minutes before I realized what was happening. As those minutes went on, my stomach hurt more and more. The place where it was sucking on me began to feel painful, like it was bruising. I panicked, and I jolted. I began to tighten my grip on its neck and twist my hands in different directions. I felt like it was almost done, but I woke up too early. I felt it resist my grasp, and it struggled to continue. Then there was a hum. A distinctive sound and vibration occured so clearly bursting into my eardrums. It vanished. Disappeared as quickly as it came. I woke up immediately and felt a sudden urge to check the time. It had only been 10 minutes since my boyfriend left for work. This whole strange occurrence happened in 10 minutes? I know I couldn’t have fallen back asleep that quickly, and I know nothing could have come and gone from my apartment. But one thing was for sure, my stomach was in pain. It was sore, really sore. It didn’t feel like a digestive issue, and it didn’t feel like nerve pain. It really felt like I had a strong vacuum on that small area for too long. Unfortunately, no I did not check to see if there was a mark, which I regret to this day. 

Now, this is all fun and games, but I know there were many things that happened before I went to sleep that would contribute to such a strange dream. First of all, my sleep was out of whack, and I went to bed at around 2am. I recently started a lifestyle change of counting my calories and keeping track of my sugar intake. I also was doing my first ab workout in a very long time an hour before I went to sleep. Earlier the day before, I ordered a vacuum, a much needed household item for our new apartment, and something I was looking forward to getting. And lastly, it’s quarantine. Everyone is under a lot of stress as we watch the world change quickly into uncertainty, and we have all been inside for weeks now. I myself have gone crazy trying to find things to do, since all of my hobbies were outside with other people. There have also been many reports of very vivid dreams occuring for thousands of other people during this time for these reasons. 

I have always found dreams interesting, and try to analyze them as best I can right after they happen. Our brains are complex, and find very creative ways to try and process our everyday life and emotions. But I can’t deny that this felt real. I really believe this happened to me. I can explain a dream away as much as I want, but why did my stomach hurt so much for hours afterward? And only on that one side in the circular shape where it clung to me. Yes, I did an ab workout, but why didn’t my whole abdomen hurt? I think of this often, and have been wanting to share this for a while. 

I love hearing alien experiences, and supernatural occurrences, so I thought I would share one of my own. I haven’t found a similar experience when it comes to the look of the creature, or a story of an alien sucking on someone on the internet yet. But maybe sharing this will encourage others to come forward to share their story. Please if you, or someone you know, or you have read about a similar experience, please send it my way, I would really appreciate it and would love to hear it.

How to contact them?,"Hey everybody!

I have been reading this subreddit this week and I gotta say I am fascinated, impressed and scared lol

Some people here seem to have some kind of psychic connection and can contact them (aliens obviously)? Dunno

I was wondering if any of you guys deliberately managed to get in contact with any species. And how

I assume the most common answer is going to be ‘they contact/find you, not the other way around”

But I am curious about it regardless

Take care and thank you for reading. Stay safe!",0

Anyone notice how it’s mostly white people who get abducted?,I’ve noticed a lot of these stories primarily involve white people? Any theories as to why this is,0
How to aliens chose who to abduct?,Do you think there’s any sort of criteria they look for in terms of who to study/ make contact with?,0
How have your memories surfaced?,"Hey y’all. Life long experiencer here. I first had physical contact (with conscious recollection) when I was a teenager. I found out a few years ago during a channeling session that I’ve been abducted multiple times growing up. And that I’ve also been on ships. I was told the purpose of these abductions were to gather viable genetic material to be used for hybridization purposes. I also found out i have many hybrid children.  

I don’t have any conscious recollections of my abductions though. I had a recession done a few years ago from someone well known in the field and still didn’t have much luck remembering. The person who facilitated the recession told me that they’ve done a really good job at screening my memory. I was curious how others have gone about remembering their abductions later in life. Any techniques or meditations perhaps? Or did it come back naturally when it was meant to. All insights appreciated. Cheers!",0

Lifetime of contact?,"Good day, I wanted to start this by saying that since I have memory I have been dealing with this phenomena. I am an educated blue collar American middle class worker, but I come a rural very small Mexican town. I have nothing to hide, lose or gain by expressing my experiences. Now that the pentagon is allowing the truth to come out, I would like to tell my truth as well.

I will start my first experience back in the late 90's, one day at my grandma house, me and my cousin claimed to the ceiling, we were looking at the sky and the stars, at one point by the close range of mountain, as far as two miles away, we began to see what looked like a fire ball, moving in a very wavy manner, up and down in small and slow strokes, something out of mind for me at that time. I had never seen things of that nature, so we called up one of our aunts, she joined us on the ceiling, and as we pointed the ball, she saw it, some of my cousins also were able to caught a sight of it, but a few minutes it just disappeared on the mountain range. At that time we knew it was not airplanes because of the distance from the mountain tops, we live in a such remote area that we barely ever see helicopters. My aunt and cousins agreed that we had seen a witch flying. To me at the point was believable, and went with this theory for many years to come. 

Another time around this time happened to me that while I was walking home from soccer practice, I happened to pass by the corner of a street, where I was turning right, I saw the glimpse of a very blueish light, maybe a rod of about 10m long. A light that back then to me it was as weird as nothing else similar I had since, now a days we have LEDs but back then we did not have this technology in the masses and nor in the size I saw the object to be. When I got home, I told my mom the story still buzzed by the question on my mind. Another very weird situation would arrive a day when in town I saw this shirt with a picture of a common green(gray) alien, the moment I saw that image, my mind went bizarre, it was kind of logic defying, my mind could not figure out what was so familiar and graspable about the image. I had to buy the shirt and began to do my research more into why the image was so palpable for me. One day as I arrived wearing my shirt to my grandma house, she saw it and mention her story, she said that the monita that visits her looked like the monitos on my shirt.

Her story used to go like this; some nights there is a monita(doll) which visits her, this doll always comes down from the ceiling and trespassing the north wall. The doll always does this and with it always has a small flashlight on the hand. For this very reason I had and many other people had stayed with her, because according to her stories even if the doll does not hurt her, she does not feel very safe, she even had a second bed in her room for guests. She also mentioned many times that she can feel when the doll will visit her. As a kid, I saw nothing wrong with this story since I heard it since a kid, and myself had gone to stay with her, and never seen the doll. There is no way she would make this up either since it was a story she would tell everyone, adults her daughter/sons, everyone who would listen. Some aunts and uncles believed that it was a ghost that was protecting a treasure there at my grandmas house. I believed their story for many years, and I ignore it until later in my life when I wanted to really understand it, and I know for a fact that my grandma was no crazy, or even mentally ill. I asked around about the story around my family, she had given description  of the monita, she mentioned a weird smell, big black eyes, very doll like clothes, and a flashlight in the hand. One time I was reading about abduction stories, when someone mentioned that aliens visit them by coming through the roof, slowly landing on the floor. Then my grandma story made more sense to be a visitation rather than some illusion or dream.

One of the most shocking stories was when I was playing volleyball during my school break, when a team member bounced the ball up high, I ran to bring the ball back to the court, when I look up to see the ball, right on the far end of the local mountain, I saw a small cloud. Very unusual to see just one small cloud in the sky, but there was something that caught my attention even more than that small cloud, a small dark triangle, right by the small cloud. I was so astonished and shocked that I did not care if other people were seeing it, as I was looking at it, it began to move in a horizontal manner towards the small cloud, its color began to turn more metallic grey . Once the triangle joined the cloud, I expected the object to come on the other side, except it never did. Once I recover my mind, I asked couple of my team members if the had seen it, obviously they did not. Words will never suffice how this experience changed my life. For days, I had not idea of what to make of my sight, I wanted to believe that maybe it was an illusion, I felt that my whole perspective of my life and future needed to be rewritten, and I had not idea on what to believe this time around. 

My next event came in a night, in late 90's. I had waken up during the night, as I was woken up, I felt a presence, I turn to my bed side and saw what I thought to be a tall shadow, and it came to mind that it might have been my dad had arrived from the USA and had come see me. Then the shadow start moving towards the door, so I turn to keep sleeping and thought to myself how happy I was going to be when I wake up later that day to go see the stuff my dad had brought. The morning came, I woke up and ran to my mom's room, asking for my dad. My mom said that my dad had not arrived, and that I might have been dreaming. I know it was not a dream, and I know no one else was there because the size of the shadow was too tall to be my mom's or my sister's. Not far from this happening, one night I woke up while I felt like flying on my bed, I remember enjoying it so much, because the wind would hit my face as I was flying ON MY BED, it was an amazing feeling, then a memory of been pin down a bed, with the typical grey aliens around me, looking at me and telling me stuff I could not understand, I even remember thinking if they were speaking English to me( I knew only Spanish at this time). I began to feel very edgy, I remember I wanted to get lose and leave, and as I turned to one side to get off the table, I saw what looked like a human, an elder and bold man with glasses, among the other beings, this of course came to me like a relief, I thought to myself, that he could be a human doctor   
 and he would be able to protect me. Then I woke up, on my bed, I was still feeling the bright lights on my eyes. Then in the morning, as I recalled the 'dream' while getting off bed, I saw by the middle of my bed, very small blood steins. So it occurred to me that I was bleeding, quickly I looked to my legs and feet for the cut, to my surprise I found three little dots on one of my knees, that fitted perfectly the blood stains. I told my sister about it, she just laughed, she probably thinks I was playing a joke on her. 

As I grew older I began to feel and see patterns on this phenomena that I was going through. For one I noticed that before one of this unexplained lose time and weird dreams would happen, I would feel uneasy and restless for up to a week before it would happen. Many times I would ask my mom if I could sleep in her room because the freight I would feel at night. As you can imagine, one night I went to sleep in my mom's room, and the weird dream began, I was pinned on a vertical wall, not lights just pinned there against it, and then some beings began to fill the room, I remember them trying to talk to me or tell me something to ease me down, for I was already feeling edgy. This time though I thought that if this was a dream, if I screamed to the top of my lungs my mom would hear me, therefore it would be a dream. I have the memory of thinking that time I was not going to allow them to do whatever they did to me. I remember trying to escape and even hitting a creature, next thing I woke up on my mom's room. Feeling the numbness of some of my body parts, obviously this was not a dream either.  

A few time later, I migrated to the USA. Where I began a new life, but the feeling of been visited didn't stop there, if anything after I moved here, things began to get more serious. In this country I have had more 'visits' than I could remember in Mexico. With life experience I can tell you that I am able to differentiate from memories and dreams. But I cannot tell you if this is real of just my wishful thinking, I cannot tell you that I have a memory of me talking to them and asking what is going on. I cannot tell you if they are here, and they are good or bad. But I can tell you that if they exist and they had been following and guiding me for all this years, it means to me that they are benevolent.",0
Maybe I used to be abducted?,"The memories are so faded now but reading through your guys posts I remembered something that happened to me when I was little. I remember having this vivid dream over and over, and it was so consistent that I can still remember that I used to think about it a lot when I was a child. It was just like one segment where I was laying on something that looked like a white bed and was just the exact size of my body. Everything was so white almost fluorescent. I also remember seeing both of my parents next to me behind a frame that had round corners looking at me so worried almost crying, but I couldn’t talk to them. I always thought that it was just a weird dream and also I never got scared of it. I remember once I told my mom about it and she didn’t say anything to me or maybe she wasn’t listening. I think I’m going to ask her now lol",0
Need to tell this to someone.,"Good evening to everyone. I feel like it’s time for me to put this out there as it has weighed heavily on my mind lately. I’m a 44-year-old male living in southeast Georgia. When I was 10 years old, I used to live only a couple of houses down from my little cousin.  He was 8. He and I and a few of the other neighborhood children would play what was called flashlight tag.  That’s basically where you play hide and seek, but it’s at night and the person who is “IT” uses a flashlight to spot people and catch them.  Whoever is found first becomes “IT.”  Our Neighborhood was in a rural area with a couple of farms and fields around the vicinity. It was pretty much out in the countryside.  It was my cousin’s turn to be “IT” and I decided I would hide in the pasture directly behind our house. I jumped the small fence behind our yard and got into the (fairly large) pasture where there is a large oak tree near a small pond. My plan was to hide in that tree from my cousin.  The others were scared to go into that field but I wasn’t, so I took advantage of that fact. As I was running top speed to get to the old oak while my cousin loudly counted down, I remember experiencing what I can only describe as two rapid, consecutive up close “flashes” right in my face  which stopped me in my tracks. Just, *FLASH FLASH* back to back over a half of a second’s time, maybe. I stood there a bit confused wondering what that was and then dismissed it, remembering to get to the oak tree. I got to it and climbed up onto the lowest hanging limb and made my way towards the trunk and straddled the base of the branch and waited a bit. After a few seconds I heard my mother’s voice screaming my name from our back porch in the distance and she sounded upset and worried. So I climbed down out of the tree and began to walk back to the fence to our back yard, thinking I was in trouble for being on the neighbor’s property. As I walked, I noticed a police car on the far side of the pasture with the red and blue lights on display, and what looked like an officer shining his flashlight across the field back and forth slowly. I thought I was in a lot of trouble. I ran back to the fence and hopped it and ran across the yard, seeing my mother on the back porch in her nightgown. The door was open behind her, illuminating her form.  She was again  calling out my name and I said “I’m here mama!” And ran to the porch waving.  She saw me and I remember her clutching her chest and running down the steps to grab me and hug me saying “oh thank GOD!”  I was confused and said “am I in trouble?” She said “no but where have you been?? I was so worried! We called the police! We didn’t know what happened to you!” And I told her it was ok, I was just hiding in the oak tree in the pasture from my cousin. “Didn’t you hear me calling you???” but I didn’t know how long she had been calling and I never really asked her about the situation again, nor did I think to tell anyone about those two flashes I experienced. I am a very agnostic and skeptically minded person who doesn’t scare easily, but this experience has me a bit anxious to think about. The only reason I thought to post it here was because my cousin and I recently talked about that night. He told me they were all looking for me for hours and asked me what I did that night and where I really went. So. I told him all that happened as I remembered it, and he got me to start looking into it.  Any thoughts and opinions are welcome. This experience is a mystery to me and I am terrified of what it implies if it’s more than just the confused memory of a 10 year old.",0
I hope I fell asleep at the wheel. . .I hope.,"Feel free to ask any questions. Prove to me I fell asleep and I will be happier and in your favor forever. 

This happen a few months ago. So I work as a nurse and started a new job 45 mins away at a nursing home that pays well and has the shift I want. The shift I normally work is weekend doubles evening and overnights a 16 hour shift a day. But they needed me to work morning and evening this particular weekend I agreed. (switching my sleeping schedule) The night shift nurse who came to relieve me was late sunday night. I was behind on charting anyways so I didn't get upset. I was giving report and heard a yelling, resident on the floor. (He was with it and said he fell, he was wearing warm socks that are not non slip sent ER due to his hip.) More charting state reportable if broken stay to help she's a pecker on typing. Get out of work at 1-2 a.m (close to a 20 hour shift after an 17 hour shift the day before) I was dead on my feet but I felt well enough to drive. (My car is very tiny, I can't sleep in it, a smart for 2, and my friend wouldn't answer the phone.)

The way I go home has a lot of twists and turns. I travel by the lake and love the water so it helps stay awake. Instead of the shorter 40 min path. I go past a small town twist turns and woods, listen to my book to keep awake. About halfway home. (Notice I left my glasses work cause I'm an idiot who puts them down to chart and dont notice I cant see until I'm like oh yeah the world isn't suppose to be a little blurry. I do this a lot)

At the next turn there is a bright light like a spot light coming through the woods. I continue on a little bit further still in the wooden area and towards where the bright light is coming from. Bend in the road once more, on the side of of the road where the night before I saw a hit deer, was what looked to be a very thin man, skin tight black clothes kneeling over the deer that is still there his back is towards me, I thought he looked weird but my glasses were gone and my eyes are starting to blur a little more. The spot light was coming from the woods pointing towards the man. I remember thinking about the light thinking about how they got their vehicle through the woods. But again I was dead. I try to pause my book, and and my car is slow down nearly stopped. The man starts to move from the deer, I roll down my window and ask , ""Is everything okay? Need any help?"". Not really looking at him. I thought that maybe it was a different deer and he hit it. I am about 15-20 or so feet in-front of them. My car is stopped at this point. I am still trying to get my book to stop my touch screen radio isn't working well (happens to freeze sometimes) so I pick up my phone and stop my book.  I really look towards the man after looking away from my phone, and realize that he or she really isn't a human . I freeze. It has stood up and faced me. The head is huge like they describe aliens to be with huge black eyes. Except it is tall, not a tiny thing like they show on TV. It starts to walk towards my car. I can't breath, I can't move. I felt like I couldn't even think, everything just felt like it froze. I heard a voice not mine that sounded like it was just in my head say. ""Sleep.""

I blink. It is gone along with the deer. I look at my clock almost 4 a.m. My car is in park now and I am pulled over with no memory of doing so. My window is still down, I look at my phone which is still in my hand, I open it and my book is still stopped in the same place. I try to call my sister but she wouldn't answer (asleep). So I call my job. They answer, I ask about my glasses and the resident. I eventually tell her I fell asleep and wanted to talk to someone so it doesn't happen again and everyone is asleep. She stayed on the phone till I got home. 

(I wouldn't call this an abduction but an encounter but I lost that time. Also, I have never fell asleep driving before or without meaning to kind of insomniac, I dont have vivid dreams, I am so uncool I never drink do drugs or anything interesting. I am use to late hours because I can't say no when another nurse or aide need help so I stay late a lot)

I don't think I fell asleep, but I pretend I did so I don't go insane. I haven't told anyone this. It scares me just thinking about it. If I did fall asleep I could have hurt someone. If I didn't then \~ 

TL;DR Worked super late into the night after a long shift the day before and either put my book on pause pulled over and rolled down my window with no memory of being so responsible. Or saw an alien and asked if they needed help and they knocked me out and stole a deer.",0
Does anyone know if Betty Andreasson kids remember the abduction? Anyone who could corroborate her story?,0,0
I felt something slide into my brain,"I was doing meth at the time, but I literally had the sensation of something sliding into my brain. I got an MRI done and nothing was there. Do you think it could be aliens?

Also, I walked out of my room and back into it and the carpet was perfectly vaccuumed and there was a perfect rectangle in my carpet. I have a feeling aliens did it.",0

**A curious case of being lost to the night**

&#x200B;

The following event took place 8 years ago, give or take.  The west coast of Scotland; to be more precise: the UK, - Scotland, the area was Wemyss bay, in a small village called Skelmorlie:- the end of the line for Glasgow and the river Clyde!   

My long term girlfriend and I had flown up to Glasgow to stay with some close friends. They had moved from England years ago – they’d tried getting me to visit for years, I’d always put it off, joking it was trap! Inevitably I would be lynched as payback for atrocities brought on by the ‘southerners’!  Obviously I didn’t really believe this, it was just a stupid joke yet I did have a sense of foreboding which is impossible to explain. But here I was, looking down into the gloomy mouth of the Clyde - Lights blinking from the ferries, as they journeyed to and fro with the isle of Bute. – Sporadic flashes in the sky, as the lighthouse cast its warning to the boats.

They had a beautiful rambling house of Victorian age; huge bay windows that looked down into the murky motionless waters separating Bute from the mainland. Complete with arches, battlements and turret, the house came with a self-contained flat high up on the 3rd floor. A reclusive musician lived alone in the turret composing modern classical music on a grand piano; seldom seen, he’d appear at the window occasionally. 

We had gone up to Scotland to celebrate New Year, by the 31st December, a thick layer of snow had descended along with a huge drop in temperature.

I will now attempt to tell my tale: as i said it took place about 8 years ago when i was about 42/43. I’m very unfamiliar with where i was staying; it was a large Victorian house in a small coastal village. It’s a large house on a fairly minor road in the centre of the village. There are many houses on the street and they are all old and large.  The winter was a particularly cold one, in fact extremely cold. So much snow in fact, the airport was closed for a few days. i guess we were staying there for 6 days and this particular event took place on new year’s eve.

We had gone to a local pub and returned back to our friend’s house for a small gathering.  I hadn't really had that much to drink, and I remember most of the evening up to a certain point.  If my memory is correct I was in an upstairs room chatting with my partner, and my mate’s brother who is a commercial airline pilot. There were also a couple of other people that I don't know so well - it would have been about 12.30a.m/1a.m. I then proceeded downstairs into a larger room where a sound system was playing –it’s from here my memory starts to get sketchy. I got talking to this young looking guy who I think was DJ’ing at one point. We made small talk, the music is loud, it’s hard to hear what he’s saying and my last concrete memory is of him introducing me to his girlfriend…

………

and then nothing

And I mean NOTHING!

The next thing I’m aware of is, it’s dark and there’s no noise. It is calm and silent.  I’m stood in a room, I can vaguely make out items of furniture that look ornate and unfamiliar. I remember a chaise longue, I remember a fire place, the room is warm. I then start to hear voices.  The voices become louder and then I become aware of shouting being directed at me; other people joining in. More people shouting at me, demanding to know what i'm doing, why I’m there and how did I get in. I’m confused. Very confused.  I’ve no idea where I am. Nothing looks familiar. No-one is recognisable. I keep asking where I am. There is much confusion going on. Other people come into the room, voices become more raised; i get the hint that some of the guys there are starting to get aggressive in their questioning. i am completely bewildered, I believe I was in shock, I have absolutely no idea where I am - nothing is recognisable. I sense the air of aggression growing, I can only think to apologise, There are 3 or 4 guys demanding details from me, I just keep apologising over and over saying I meant no harm. I remember being threatened with what I think was a poker for the fire and I began begging for mercy – I also vaguely remember one of their girlfriend trying to calm the guys down and being relatively sympathetic however, a couple of the guys demanded I leave immediately. It all happens quickly but I  get shown to the door as its opened for me to leave.  As i look outside i see nothing, no lights, just a track leading into the trees. I try to explain I don't know where to go – I remember really begging them to tell me where I had to go, which way? I begged and begged for help which I think gave 2 of the guys bravado because they were screaming at me to fuck off or they were going to ‘do me’ one of the other guys I think wasn’t so aggressive and gave me the direction I needed to walk down the lane to get off the property and back onto a public road. As I walked away I continued pleading with them that it was so cold and I didn’t know where to go. I had no coat and I found out later it was between minus 15-20 Celsius. The aggressive ones followed me down the track still threatening me – I then became worried as we were away from the more rational sympathetic members of their group and we were kind of hidden amongst the trees. I carried on down the track through the trees, on into the darkness I got to the road and just kept walking. I can’t explain to you just how cold I was

As I walked through the darkness I was so scared. i could not understand what was happening, i did't know why I was here. i didn’t know where here is. i didn't know where i'd come from or where I was going. I think the cold took away all other thoughts. My only concern became getting out of the cold

i don't think i have ever experienced such cold. i can't remember how long it was but eventually i saw headlights - i waved my arms for the car to stop and it was a taxi! i remember getting in the cab and thanking the driver for what felt like he was saving my life. It was the first time in quite a while that I felt safe, however when the driver asked me where I wanted to go, I had no idea. My mind was blank. I had no idea where I wanted to go. I had no idea where I was.  I remember the taxi man asking if I had money - i had £10 on me and we agreed that he'd drive around until the money ran out and see if anything jogged my memory. After not very long the meter ran up to £10 and the driver said he'd have to drop me off. I pleaded with him that i couldn’t go back into the cold and out of concern he took me to the nearest police station.

It wasn’t a proper police station - it was one of these country police stations that is more like someone’s house. Anyhow there happened to be a couple of police officers in a car outside the building. The taxi man filled them in on me. I remember we went into this room which I think was somewhere where they kept uniforms and general equipment/supplies. I think I kept apologising for wasting their time blah blah blah, anyhow when they asked me my details i could not for the life of me remember my name. I didn’t know where I was from. i couldn’t remember my address - not even the city. I couldn’t tell them where and who I was staying with. I remember I could tell them where I was born but no details more than this. i then started to become very upset. i believe I started hyper ventilating. I remember sobbing asking the police why I didn’t know who I was or where I was from.

the police called the paramedics. I was put in the back of an ambulance. One of the medics found my phone in my pocket but it had no power however they had a charger and when he got it working he phoned the number that was the most used and thankfully it was my girlfriend’s number - she answered and told them where I should be. The medics checked me over and found the only concern was I was hypothermic. I said I did not want to go to hospital so kindly they drove me back to my friends where we were staying. I think it was now about 8.30am - when we pulled up at my friends place, i saw my girlfriend and it was as if all these memories started to come back. It felt like a rush which made me throw up a few times

so my partner and friends tried to understand where i had been all night - I explained to them the house that I had been in and it seems it was this old property I think may have been owned by the YMCA and they rented it out to holiday makers. Its surrounded by trees and is at the other end of skelmorlie to where we were staying. At the time it never really made sense as to why I ended up there and how! it was put down to me probably doing some psycho active drugs, maybe mushrooms or E's/skunk and too much alcohol, but i know that was not the case. My last real memory of being at my friends house i felt quite sobre - i remember having a fairly sobre conversation with my mates brother, the pilot.

I think of this night often. One memory that came back was of me being shown something. what ever it was, this something had the most beautiful absorbing colours that captivated me. i have the memory of being with someone where we didnt have a conversation as such but they were showing me something and i could see these colours swirling into each other. the being with me was goodlooking. i couldnt for sure say if it was male or female but i get the feeling it was a feminine being. we were somewhere very quiet and there was an air of tranquility and safeness. i was speaking to this being but i'm not sure that i was actually saying the words or if i was just thinking them but it was along the lines of how everything that i was being shown was perfection

i wish i could remember more.

anyhow the reason i have come here to pass my story on is that i hoped by typing this out it might have jogged my memory and also i have read or listened to someones story that made me think maybe i too was abducted. Was I dropped off at the wrong house. I think there were similarities to the 2 houses – both old and large. I don’t know how I would have got into the other house. There was no damage or noise of me getting in. I think I had been asleep on the chaise longe at the YMCA house and when I awoke I started to look around the room and there were some other people asleep in there, how I didn’t initially wake them up is another mystery. It’s the most bizarre thing I have ever been involved in. the only bizarre experience that I’m aware of

the rationale for this is why on earth i would set off on a journey across the village without a coat or anything warm on perhaps the coldest night of the year

there were similarities to my friends house and the house that i found myself in. i don't know this part of the country at all - its a mystery how i could have found this holiday house and found my way into the house. the house isnt visible from the road- could i have been delivered to the wrong house by mistake

what happened to my memory?

who was this other being and what were they showing me",0
My experience,"I wanted to share this because for me it actually changed me, and im not stupid, before this happened I was the type of person to laugh at or dismiss abuctees/alien experiences as hoaxes to gain popularity, or just as mentally ill people, but for me it really happened, and for the rest of my life I will always think of as a real experience, because i remember the feeling of complete terror, being completely sober, and completely clear, in the middle of the night, and it wasnt pleasant at all.  Before I start, know that I have nightmares just like anyone else and I know how to differentiate between a bad dream and reality. This will always be reality to me.  I woke up at 3:00 am roughly and I thought I would go get a drink I was parched, but when I started too I had this weird feeling like everything was right, everything looked right but darker, if I opened the blinds there was still no light and if I focused on something, like really focused on the details of the floor or the wall or anything but really closely the room would reset with me in it but the details would change slightly again like I was put in a room, or a simulation of a room, my room, to make me feel comfortable, but every time I focused on the details of anything I would start over again in the doorway of the same room, almost as if every time I noticed something out of place they would restart the simulation I was in.  I remember Crying, and pleading with whatever it was to let go of me or kill me, and it Answered, this was when I realized that whatever I thought, if I thought a question, it would answer it instantly just as fast as I could think of it, it answered almost too fast because my brain would think of multiple questions At once, so all I would hear was responses, yes, no , but so quickly that I had to focus on what I was asking and make sure that was the only thing I was thinking at that time, focus on That one question so that I knew the response i got was for that question. Anyways Im tired of typing, I hope some of u enjoy my experience because it’s real for me, and it terrifies  me to this day, when I wake up and the room looks the same but different I start to pray that I don’t get taken again.",0

Follow up to my post yesterday looking for shows that use real claims of alien abduction and then discuss and re-enact them.,"So I got a few answers that weren’t what I was asking for like The fourth kind, fire in the sky, etc. I was specifically looking for documentary type shows where they go over real alien abduction claims and then re-enact the abduction. 

I wanted to provide some examples so that people understand what I’m looking for and what I am not looking for. Also I think all of you will really enjoy these abduction shows. 

I wrote the stuff below in the comment section of my post replying to someone but thought it would make a good post of its own for others that are interested in the topic of alien abduction and re-enactments. 

There was a show in 1991 that did a great job of it called “Visitors from the unknown”. It’s on amazon prime for free if anyone else wants to watch it. James Earl Jones narrates it and I loved it. They did a sequel in 1992 called “Visitors from the unknown - Doorways” that has UFO/ghost/psychic mixed. 

Here is a link to original Visitors from the unknown 
https://watch.amazon.com/detail?asin=B08234S6SQ&territory=US&ref_=share_ios_movie&r=web

Here is a link to the doorways episode from 1992

https://watch.amazon.com/detail?asin=B082FQYRMJ&territory=US&ref_=share_ios_movie&r=web

If you know of any other shows, documentaries, docuseries, YouTube videos, etc. that are just like these shows please share them below and how to watch them. A direct link would be great but at minimum please list where we can watch it like Prime, Netflix, Sailing the high seas.",0

"I really want to get this off my chest, my experience being abducted for over 9 years."," 

First off I want to say that im not a native speaker, therefore my grammar might not be the best.

Im a 17yo, 18 in May, who went through over 9 years of constant abduction and I want to share my history.

This whole thing began when I was 6yo, I clearly remember going to sleep with a strange feeling just to wake up during the night with a constant noise coming from my ears, this noise got louder as time passed by and it suddenly stopped, that was the moment when a thing entered my room and stared at me for what seemed like hours. Over the course of the following weeks this thing got closer up to a point where it was just a few inches apart from my face, I could clearly see it, it was a grey.

This kept happening for literal years at least twice a week, sometimes I would wake up in the floor, sometimes I would wake up during the night feeling something being injected in my arms, sometimes I would be covered in nasal blood and sometimes I could see them touching my face. During my firsts years going through this i learned about sleep paralysis, but I was able to move before they entered my room and even when they were already inside I could move my hands and sometimes even my arms, which always ended with them going away.

The last time they came, which was almost 3 years ago, I was able to grab one of their arms really tightly, it felt horrible tbh, and when I realized they were no longer in my room. 

But even now I can’t sleep properly bc I almost daily wake up feeling like im being watched, feeling an ominous presence in my room 

Im not entirely sure what happened during those years, all I know is that something horrible happened to me and I feel nothing but hate towards those greys or whatever they truly are. I was able to touch one of them and Im quite sure they are really physically weak so there’s the chance that I might be able to kill one of them, if they ever come back that’s it.

I’ve experienced a lot more and im willing to answer any question you might have. Also, what do you think this whole thing was? Being honest im not totally sure myself, it could be anything.",0

Might not be anything spectacular but...,"Strange coincidence. Been a little obsessive with UFO's and such the last little while. Have been speaking about what I believe was some type of experience around 20 years ago lately that I had never really spoken much about.. Now today this. In my province.

..was I abducted?,"This story happened about two years ago. I understand there could be other explanations for this, but the feelings surrounding it are just really off to me, so I figured I should ask. 
I believe it was around 10 in the morning, I had been up for a while and was just laying in bed, but I had plans later that day so I decided to get up. I remember standing up. Then there's absolutely nothing. Complete blackness, and a feeling of being completely limp and unable to move. I fought to open my eyes, and when I did, I was across my bedroom, sat against the door like I had been propped up there. I wouldn't have been able to fall like that without falling backwards and hitting my head on the door, and I had no injuries. Sitting there I still felt completely limp, until I tried to move my body. It felt like a wave washed over me and suddenly I could move again, and I also felt like my body was mine again. It felt like I was coming back into my own body. I stood up, extremely wigged out, and went to check my phone. I had sent a message saying I was getting ready to the friend I had plans with, and that was 40 minutes ago. 

..somehow I had blacked out for 40 minutes without even knowing it? And had crawled across the room and sat by the door? 
I have no personal or family history of seizures or anything of the sort, and again, I was not injured. I didn't believe in extraterrestrials or anything at the time, so the possibility of abduction didn't cross my mind. Though I believe now, I don't know if this is congruent with other stories. Maybe it's something else entirely. I had almost forgotten about this, but it just came back into my head last night. Now when I think about it my eyes start to water and I feel really anxious. Any insight is appreciated. Will answer any questions.

Edit: I talked to the friend that I had messaged before this happened and they said that they didn't notice the time pass either, though they didn't have any experience. Could be coincidence, but interesting.",0
Twisting lights entering the center of forehead,"Hello my little fellows, this story happened to me last month.

I was studying in my apartment, listening to chilling music (this one; OP note: listen to it with caution lol: [https://youtu.be/hrUuK6y4yng](https://youtu.be/hrUuK6y4yng)) when I got up to spend some time looking to the horizon; I saw some lights - seemed 3 or more - orbs that twisted and turned and suddenly came my way and entered the center of my forehead. They seemed to be one blue, one yellow and one red light that twisted and shuffled between them and from the horizon took an impressive speed and entered my head making noise of a sort o fan, spilling air and at the same time, impressively silent.

The next thing I remember is waking up listening to this soundtrack - do not remember putting any earbuds bud woke up with them , this track playing nd my watch\`s alarm biping.

The sound track: [https://youtu.be/dIAzpaHbUVU](https://youtu.be/dIAzpaHbUVU)

And also I\`ve been maintaining a Maithuna practice along (I\`m single) along with initial meditation practices, and also shamanic rites for the greater good, not for me.

&#x200B;

I also saw after waking up, from 3 to 7 bees - don\`t rememeber exactly the number. I wanted to catch them but they would not come my way.

Difficult to explain story, very unusual to what I’m used to live.

I wish I could tell it from happening or not but I’m more and more a believer that the truth is out there...",0

Has anyone ever been revisited? I fear I may be soon,"I posted an experience I had when I was a teenager about a week ago. Here’s the link: https://reddit.com/r/Abductions/comments/fk7uqu/memory_from_when_i_was_a_teenager/

I’ve had some strange things happen ever since. I’m not sure if these are all in my head or if the aliens that abducted me 15 years ago are attempting to revisit me.

Several nights ago I was in bed, not quite sleeping yet but a little tired and I suddenly heard this loud beeping sound inside my head. It was quite loud and seemed to repeat once every 5-10 seconds for about a minute or so. I’m fairly certain that only I could hear it as my wife was asleep next to me and didn’t react. After about a minute the beep stopped and was replaced by this static sound like when you would turn on an old TV. I’m not sure if my eyes were open or shut at this point but I could see all of this white and black distortion that completely took over my vision.  This went away after a few seconds and I found myself staring off the side of my bed unable to move. After a couple of minutes I regained the ability to think and move again and felt normal. I turned around and my wife was fast asleep. It was a startling experience.

Another weird thing happened last night while I was in bed. I was in a similar state of laying down, not quite asleep when I suddenly felt the room shake. I panicked at first thinking it was an earthquake, which coincidentally there was an earthquake in my state a few days earlier, but this felt different. It didn’t feel like the ground below me was shaking but rather the house was vibrating. This didn’t last long. When it stopped I heard this strange “whooshing” sound and saw a flash of light out the window, then everything was back to normal. Once again my wife slept through the entire experience.

I’m not sure if these experiences were sleep paralysis or some sort of hallucination or alien visitors. It seems strange that both of these experiences occurred within a week of sharing my abduction story on this sub. Is it possible my abductors are watching my activity or somehow read my post and are reaching out again?  Has anyone ever had a similar experience or am I losing my mind?",0

Alien abduction of Betty and Barney hill- A real story,"The September night of 1961 was the life-changing night for the young couple, Betty and Barney. A couple that lived in Portsmouth, Betty and Barney were civil servants where Barney worked in a post office and had to travel 60miles every day back and forth for work. Betty was handling State child welfare cases, and the biracial couple were devoted to their church and civil rights movement activities. The overworked couple finally took a short vacation to New Hampshire’s White mountain which they said was a spur of the moment decision like a much-delayed honeymoon. They had only $70 in their pocket and spent three days in the white mountains. 

However, the night of the third day became the night that changed the course of their life when they felt they were being followed by beaming light from the sky. The road to the house was empty, and the two-hour journey felt like forever as the beaming light did not stop following them. The couple got curious and stopped the car to check what the light was, and Betty saw through her binoculars. She exclaimed to Barney that he is ridiculous to think that it is a satellite or a star. Barney knew she was right as a jet or helicopter will not hover around in such a clear and silent night. 

Barney, who was a world war-II veteran and an avid plane watcher with an IQ of 140, knew it was something else. When the beaming light did not stop following them, Barney came out of the car 70 miles from the diner with a gun in his pocket and went into the woods. He saw the beaming light through the binoculars and was shocked to see an object as big as a jet and flat as a pancake. All he could say himself, “My God, what is this thing?” he recalled thinking. “This can’t be real.” He could not lift his hand to shoot and could see that behind the windows of the object men in gray uniform were watching him. 

Hysterical and confused, he ran towards the car as he felt that they would be captured. After two hours, the couple drowsy and confused walked into the house with the clothes ripped apart, watches not working and Barney’s shoes strangely scuffed, but the two hours of the drive completely vanished from their memories. After the incident, Betty had strange dreams and Barney developed ulcer and anxiety. After months of anxiety, they contacted Benjamin Simon, a psychiatrist and neurologist who specialized in hypnosis, a mainstream technique at the time.

Simon, the psychiatrist, helped them put the pieces together with the help of hypnosis and they discovered the Aliens abducted them. They were taken into a spaceship where they were separated from each other and extensive examination was conducted on each. In fact, Betty was so excited to see the aliens; she even talked to them and said that their leader looked like Hitler.

During the examination, the aliens took hair strands, clipped nails and scraped their skin that was then placed on a transparent material, not a glass slide. They also probed their head, eyes, ear, legs and spine with 4-6inches long needles that were connected to long wires. Betty was also given a crude pregnancy test which made her twist in pain. Gray beings were excited to see that Barney’s teeth were removable and Betty laughed saying that they were dentures. She stated that gray beings did not understand the concept of human ageing. While she was alone with the leader of the beings, she asked him where they were to which he jokingly replied, “if you don’t know where you are, there wouldn’t be any point in telling you where I am.” She even drew the star map, which was shown to her in the spaceship while she was under hypnosis. 

The story of Hill’s was published in the Boston Newspaper, and after that, there was nothing normal in their life. A book and movie were made on their story; debates were held whether the couple was hallucinating the whole thing, sleep-deprived, liars or were high on weed. Many theories came forward as it was the first time somebody told aliens abducted them. Before this incident, people shared stories of witnessing a spaceship or friendly encounters, but an account of the extensive examination was hard to believe. But, the imagery of gray beings with big eyes became the sci-fi character for many years. 

A renowned psychologist from Harvard, Richard J. McNally said, The “alien-abduction’ phenomenon, in my opinion, shows how sincere, non-psychotic individuals can develop beliefs about, and false memories of, incredible experiences that never happened.” Some psychologists claimed it is the result of sleep paralysis or hallucination, but Simon, the psychologist who performed hypnosis on the couple, felt they were not lying. He concluded the whole experience as a dream Betty had, and Barney absorbed the entire experience, thus making it a real encounter for their mind.

There were many debates on the popular encounter of Betty and Barney, which made Betty a renowned voice in UFO research. But, nobody can neither conclusively deny or accept whether the abduction happened or not. The abduction is a significant possibility as the years went by, but there was no change in Hill’s story, and they remembered vividly how things happened. They denied false memories or sleep paralysis as the possibility of what they experienced.

My abduction and the year 2956.,"Edit: My friend setup an empty Facebook page called A Man Named Jack. That, and here on reddit, is where all will be posted when I’m done. The Big Bang topic is long and detailed so it will be posted there as well as here as long as I am keep this post opened. So for all of you asking for a backup in case this post gets archived, search fb for that page. 

Edit: An artist by the name of Josh has contacted me and agreed to help me SHOW a lot of stuff to you all. Again, I won’t be showing things that could alter their plan or endanger my son, but simple stuff I will show. Thanks to Josh!

Edit: I’m sorry if I’m vague in answers. It’s easier if you guys ask very specific questions. “Does Apple still exist?” Will get a yes or no. If you’re wanting to know a specific thing, ask it. Don’t be in general. As I’ll give an in general answer. Half this stuff you all are more familiar with than I am. So I don’t know what to say when it comes to some things unless you ask specifics. And IF I seen or read about it or write it in my journal, I’ll be happy to tell you. 

Edit: it seems most of you expect the future to be some big epic utopia. It can be, but wasn’t when I went. There was cool stuff and things to learn that blew my mind but most things remained the same. Some of you were upset when I said doors just auto slid open. I guess you expected them to be magical portals or something. They just weren’t. What’s not broke.....
I’ll be relaxing pages upon pages from my diary but it takes awhile to have my friend help me ensure we cross out certain information. 
____________________________________________
This is a huge story that I’ve only spoke of with 2 people. One of which suggested we just make an anonymous account online and tell it. Get it off my chest. It’s extremely hard to hold something so big in. I am in my 70s now. Also note that one of those two people I told is the one typing this message now, as I have trouble with typing and my site. 

My name is Jack. I’ll only give first name. When I was 27, living in Detroit Michigan, 1975, I was “abducted” and taken to a place under (edit: near, not under. Typo? -theguy) what Lake Michigan. (I could see water near me and I wake up on the beach of the lake.)

I was sitting on my porch with my dog one evening and he started growling. I looked out into the dark but saw not a thing. Then I noticed him looking up and growling. So I looked up. Nothing. Suddenly he looks off to the right of my porch, growling. Nothing. I decided it was time to go in. I figured it was bats. The next thing I know I feel nauseous. Butterflies in the stomach. I feel very...floaty. Everything got brighter. I’m guessing I pass out. I wake up in a field. The wind is blowing heavily. My dog nowhere. I stand up and look around and it looks to be near dark. It was already 9 at night when all this started. 

The sky is an extreme purplish color and the ground looks strange. It looks like grass but not grass. A tarnish brown color and about 6-8 inches tall. Miles of it. Mountains off into the distance. It’s dark enough I can’t really see detail of things at long distances. I am confused but very aware. After a few minutes I’m starting to feel nauseous again. I drop to my knees because I felt like I wanted to throw up. As I’m hunched over looking at the ground, I see what resembles a line of ants. Only they aren’t ants. Imagine an ant but with two rear ends and wings. Black in color. Fast. I scoot about a good to the side as to not get them on me. Lean back and pass out again. 

I slowly wake up yet again and this time I’m at home. Standing on the porch a few feet from where I was. Dog is inside with door shut and barking viciously. I think about what happened and begin to tell myself I must have been dreaming. Fast forward a week and I’m in my kitchen cooking at noon. It’s Saturday. As I stand there I feel nauseous again. Instantly memories of what happened last week hit me. I pass out. 

When I come to this time, I’m in a city that is empty and looks like it’s falling apart. No one around. Wind again is blowing heavily. Sky is a dark purple color. I recognize these buildings. I mean as in they look like our buildings. Slightly different then what I’ve seen with some odd designs but for the most part, normal. I can see signs from businesses. Everything is grown over like it’s been here untouched for a long time. Cars looked similar but more rounded. Trucks, vans and cars looked like those hybrid fancy cars. I see a taxi and it too has that rounded luxury car look. 

This time, I don’t start to feel sick. I hear something behind me and when I turn around there is two people and next to them is what looks like a little child with a very large head and very large eyes. Weird skin color and naked. It startled me and I throw my fists up as if ready to fight. I yell out what the fuck is going on! And they begin to walk towards me. One starts speaking but I’m already yelling again. Who the fuck are you!?

They get about 10 feet from me and I’m staring back and forth at them and the little weird fella. The man begins to tell me that I am in the earth year 2956. 5 years after the event. I ask them what the hell is happening? They told me that they were taking a set number of people and showing them earth's future. A few hundred thousand people alive from my time and the future generations and showing them what earth will be like. 

They explain that a number of events took place that lead to a dead earth. Not dead dead but most creatures dead. I’m crying at this point out of fear. I was a 27 year old tough guy and am breaking down like I was picked on by a girl. My fists are still up this whole time. 

They continue. There is a set number of people from my generation as well as future generations that are directly responsible for this/can do something about it. Those people will all be shown. Those people will all be guided on how to avoid this. It’s been about 10 mins so far. I now finally ask a more serious question instead of threatening them. I say I don’t buy it as there would be some kind of paradox happening we are they trying to change the past to affect the future. The girl smiles. 

Immediately another question appears in my mind and I ask them what do I have to do with any of it? I’m not a leader or president or scientist. The girl responds that I will be the father of one. A boy that will grow up to be one of those things. I ask which one and they refused to tell me for now.

They asked me to follow them so I began to. We went into a torn up building and down several stairs into a bigger room. I can see several others doing different things. They are explaining to me that the future doesn’t have to be this way and I as well as those many others can change it. 

Skip ahead, I spend about 3 months there. They showed me as much as they could. I read through history books. I looked at technology. I asked a million questions. I got a million answers. All with only one rule, that I won’t try to use it for my own advantage/success. 

There’s a lot of in the middle stuff here but I feel it would be the length of a novel to have my friend type here on this website. 
I’ve spent the past 40+ years preparing. Raised my son to be in the position he is now and guided him. I got to stay for those 3 or so months because they weren’t going to do this again with me. 

The first time, when I appeared in the field, they said it was a test. To put me through the travel and send me back. If it’s successful, they make initial contact with the subject.

I’ve seen so much. I’m filled with joy and fear at the same time. Why am I speaking out about this now? It was never spoken with me about telling or not. It seemed irrelevant outside of specific details that could change the outcome. Like my son finding out certain details. The world is growing and even more connected since I was a boy. And since it’s been so many years, the itch to want to speak about it only grew stronger. My buddy here that’s typing all this told me of a website where you can anonymously speak with people. This is what I want to do now. 

Typing 3 months of information isn’t really going to happen but I would love to spill it all out over time to anyone who wishes to listen. So here I am. It was amazing and scary the whole time but a tale I must tell before my health runs out.

Edit: The moment I got home, I began to write everything in a diary for memory purposes. I have about 100 pages of everything I could remember. So much that I often have to read through it to remember I even wrote about a subject. I’m 72 years young and my memory is trash. So every detail that came to me the first couple months I was back I would write. 

Edit: random entries will be entered from here down. There are so many things to discuss but I have to add them as we go unless I write some big book filled with it all, which I’m not going to do. So I’ll mention things directly related to questions and as I think of them. 

1. The only alien I seen was the grey guy. When I asked of alien life they said they are aware of many but only directly interact with the grey guys kind. Most confirmation of life outside earth is just from seeing evidence of it from telescopes and satellites. Tons of bacterial life known on distant planets but intelligent life is only in the 20s. Around 20 or so known lifeforms. Most of which we don’t communicate with at all. Just evident via seeing satellites around planets many light years away. 

2. The issue is that they took me to a future where earth is in peril. So I couldn’t just walk the streets and check out the latest Hollywood news. I had to use a Wikipedia type of computer thing that I could search through that contains all of mans past. Yes I looked to see if Trump won. And yes, he does. He will attempt to run a third time as well. Edit: because a few of you mentioned this, I’ll be more clear. Reading news of my time. About 100 years worth. When I came across stuff regarding trump he wasn’t the trump we know today. I was interested in just seeing who became president and seen a guy named Donald with a lot of references in news when I searched his name. Trump attempts to run a third time, what I mean by this in other comments is that in his second term, he speaks of attempting to run again and wants law to change to allow him to. That’s all. EndEdit. But it’s the president AFTER trump that you will love. This is the guy that puts in the effort we need to happen to ensure this future doesn’t happen.

3. Animals. For the ones I seen they are all the same. The only NEW animals I seen were mainly new water species. Fish that looked so weird and some weird looking ant like creatures.

4. War. There are many ways that happen over 900 years but all seemed to be minimal. Nukes are a thing of the past. I don’t want to mention what terrors isn’t use as to not influence the idea to happen sooner. I would lay at night over the 3 months and just read read read. 

5. Food. The fruit was all the same and good. But the normal dishes they prepared where just plain ole nasty to me. They weren’t big on meat. The only meat we ate were fish. The rest was vegetable and fruit based. 

6. The average life expectancy of humans in the 2900s is 140-150. It seems to be the max. However there is a lot done with consciousness transferring. In that time, again, earth is in peril so I couldn’t see a lot of this in action. The world was too torn up for any of it to be important. But before the events took the earth, I read about in 2700s we pretty much know the mind like the back of out hands. And major successes in digitally copying it. However this becomes a thing of the past when copied minds would start to act insane. Being trapped in darkness. I read that they wouldn’t last long either. Kind of like when a persons head gets cut off, for less than 10-20 seconds they are conscious and aware. The same with mind transferring. The moment they upload the mind into a machine it lasts only a short while before fading. Talking rubbish like they were getting drunker. Slurring. Then gone. Some stories reported them screaming.

7. Getting a lot of messages about technology. Sorry I was specific. As I mentioned I seen a gadget that measured what they called the “happiness” of plants. Happier equals healthier. Have no clue what it did to do that. 
Their computers looked similar to ours. A keyboard and all was touch screens. I don’t know about their windows or whatever it’s called. It was all a shade of blue. They touched things on screen and things opened up. Same as us. The box it came in was silver. Small. So you had a screen and then beside it was a tiny silver box with cables. It was about the size of a cell phone. Some people were walking around with cell phone like boxes too. But most used a watch type of gadget that projected a screen onto their arm. Then they would touch their skin as a screen. 
There was gadgets everywhere. Blindly lights all over the place. Maybe I can get an artist to reproduce it for everyone I dunno. It looked way cool but I can barely use these techno gadgets today let alone understand any of that stuff.  I did see they use those drone things. I don’t know what they did specifically but I seen one fly close to the ground and a red laser light shot out the bottom of it over objects. Then would fly off and repeat over other objects. Some kind of scanner? There’s a million other questions I didn’t ask because if I did ask about every little thing I seen we would have spent the whole time there with me not shutting up. I just looked..eyes wide open and confused and moved on. Only things that interested me did I ask about.

8. How did the time travel stuff work?
After hours of words I don’t understand from them during daily chit chat, the only bits I understood was that it takes a lot of energy. Which they collected from a small black hole that orbits our solar system. That it was discovered hundreds of years ago and they sent satellites to orbit it and collect energy that they would then send to earth or other places in the solar system. 
When I asked BUT HOW did they control time, the main guy I hung with said that they bend it. Then something like if you can move an object through space faster than the speed of light, it goes back in time. As for how they specifically send something to a specific year...I have no clue. I didn’t think to ask that question. I was confused by most of it. 

9. Why me? Apparently because my son is to grow up and be apart of the actions needed to fix all this. I know exactly what he’s to do but I can’t tell him. Only influence him. They said if I mess up or he ventures off the trail, we can reset again. I met two others just like me who was also brought to the future. Only they were the ones, not their kids. They were instructed differently than I was. Things they needed to do. Whereas I was instructed on things regarding my son. Who today, is doing what he should do. He’s not super famous but he is well known and will become known worldwide soon, because of his contributions. 

10. Scientific discovery’s/changes in our time?
I found out that in 5 years, 2025, we will have first confirmation of intelligent life elsewhere. I know that in the next 20 years we will cure nearly all of the diseases that ails us. Except cancer, it will become similar to a cold or the flu. You get it and see a dr then it’s gone. But never cured. I remember reading about laws that changed in America. Within our lifetime pedophiles will begin to be executed as long as there is concrete proof. Seen some celebrity deaths. Trump dies at 77 years of age due to heart failure during his second run as president. Bill Gates a couple of years after. A young star named Jonas or something like that, one of three brothers, is the only survivor in a plane crash that takes the life of his two brothers. Alive but in a wheel chair. This happens in 2023 I believe. There was some other celebrity stuff but it wasn’t what I was interested in. Just random news that I would see while reading about the years gone by.

11. Tell us about YOU, Jack.
Well, as I said I am 72 years of age. I spent most of my life as a roofer until I got into my 50s where I then became a security officer. Did that for years and retired. I’ve been married since I was 28. Had only one child. My son who’s now in his 30s. I know a lot of this is vague but understand I have to be very vague. Speak in general terms for a lot of this stuff. Some is fine to specify but anything related directly to the plan, I have to skim on details as to not ruin it. Anyways, I grew up in Detroit. Live there my whole life. I’ve moved since then to Florida as all of us elders tend to do.  My son has a family of his own so I’m a grandpa of three amazing kiddos. This event happens to me some 45 or so years ago. I’ve kept diaries and logs for memory purposes ever sense. Tried to draw some stuff in it.  Medically I’m healthy. Mentally I’m sound. I’m just a man who experienced something so amazing and planned to speak about it towards my final days. Which is now. As I’ve said in comments, I’m not here to educate or spoil the secret. I’m here for me. It’s been a huge relief today alone. I feel when I pass that I will no longer have as much on my shoulders to carry. Thanks to my friend recommending I do this. I’m old now. So I’m not on my toes when laying it all out there. I skim through my diary for answers as this was so long ago. But I’m more than glad to answer questions as long as they don’t risk my son nor the plan.

12. Looking through diary. The criteria for determining if a species is intelligent or not is if they are able to leave their planet or translate languages.

13. Purple sky. I asked about why the sky was more purple than anything. They mentioned that was one of the fails of man. Emissions and global warming. It was the most beautiful thing. It affected the color of the sky and would eventually render the atmosphere unbreathable. As for the science behind why purple, I do not know. Didn’t understand a lot of what they were explaining about it. 

14. The doors they had were all automatic. You walked near and they just opened and closed. You could lock the door by pressing a button next to it. The walls were of a metal content. Some silver looking but mostly white.

15. I didn’t get to see some of this but read about it. As all news and info had been stored in a database. I was free to read anything considered public on a tablet type device, which I did for hours every night I was there. I read of technology a bit. Before everything went astray, people didn’t no longer go to a dr physically unless it was to get a prescription. Most of your health was managed from home. Your urine and stool samples could be read and information sent to dr if you allowed it. There was a blue scan button on the side of the toilets. You could also have something out inside you that monitored your heart rate and many other body functions ever second. And when things like cholesterol etc were starting to go bad, you could get an alert. If it’s really bad your dr would contact you. All of this any of course many other health related things is why their life expectancy was about 150 years.

16. Pictures. I seen hundreds of photos. Throughout the 900+ years. I seen based on multiple planets. I seen videos of inventions. Jet packs become more of a thing. But not for public use for travel. But used in many other ways. Around the time just before the events kick earth in its ass, a guy had something he made that allowed you levitate any object. I seen many many photos of space stations. Also something about a moon called Europe or Europas? They find bacterial life under its thick ice as well as fish-like life and squid looking life. That happens in about 12 years from now. 

17. Aliens. While I only seen in person the grey guy. I seen photos of life they found in the solar system. Mostly the fish like things I mentioned above. And while I didn’t see any photo of this, I do know that technology and knowledge is traded amongst different species. Mostly the grey guys kind. But there were names of others and news of trade deals. Something that sounded like (spelling may be off) Gurhah. Gerha . Something like that. In English it sounded like “gerrr-ha” like when a kid plays and makes monster growl. Guurrrrr. Gerrrr. I don’t remember how it was spelled. But we trade amongst them in around 2200s.

18. Time. One of the first things I asked about when they mentioned is fixing time, was what would happen to them? Would they just disappear etc? The answer was kind of scary. To me anyways. They said that nothing happens that they notice. That if they say, wish to ensure this war didn’t happen, they set it in motion and then send the person back. If he succeeds, the war never happened and they never even knew about sending someone back to prevent it. So for them, it’s all live updating every second but once something is eliminated it’s no longer in memory. I then asked that wouldn’t that mean that when they do the very last thing needed, that to them none of this ever happened and they never had to go back and fix things nor even know about doing it at all? They said yes. However, to solve this so they can keep record of it all and ensure that they don’t repeat mistakes, some of us who they brought there will return with a package. One that labels all the steps they’ve made. They are to plant the package in a certain place which they constantly would check. So imagine a box. Like in a bank vault where you keep your stuff. They would open that box and everyday some package was in it. But the box was just a box. It’s not linked to anything. The items just appear. Daily. It contains the log of what’s been accomplished even though now none of them have any memory of doing any of it. I asked what happens if they leave the box open, could we see the package just appear? They laughed and smiled. Then changed the subject. I felt as if that info was a need to know thing. I still wonder what would have happened and why they shrugged it off so casually. Make things clearer edit: there is only one timeline. Not multiple. There is no past or future, just now. When they wish to grab someone who used to exist, like me, they setup whatever it is they use (machines etc. never got to see what they use) to lock onto the target they wish to grab. The moment they press the button (so to speak) something like a wormhole with two ends begins to grab the target on one end and the target shows up through other. However, the second they start this process, and the target is grabbed, their time ceases to exist instantly. Then, time ticks on normal for the universe until it’s the year they launched the grab. For me 2956. But, the moment I’m grabbed, I instantly am in 2956, whereas the rest of the earth time ticks on normally for over 900 years. The moment 2956 comes, I then appear. They then have no knowledge of me but read through the package and it labels all they’ve done before. Since this is a new timeline, they have never met me or anyone else before me. Then they send me back and again time ceases for them but this time I’m to make changes. 900+ years go by and their memory of me is non existent except in the package notes. So they move to next target on and on. As I said above, when they get to their very last target that’s needed to fix everything, once they grab that person then send them back, again 900+ years will pass normally and they will never of had to do any of this. The only record will be their final package explaining what they have done and what not to do etc. think of it this way...say you’re working there just like my previous example. Today is your first day. Year 2956. You suddenly get t a package and it says YOU reset time 27 times and stopped x things from happening. You announce it to your superiors and move to whatever is the next thing you have to do unrelated. But now earth is in better shape than ever and nothing bad happened. It’s confusing I know but I’ll soon get help to draw some things on paper for a visual example. 

19. My name on Reddit. DontThrowAwayMyTruth came from the guy typing all this for me. He thought it meant something. He’s a weird sum bitch sometimes. Yes I’m making him type all this. 
(I’ll break your hip ye old bastard -TheGuy)

20. After spending hours looking online using diff keywords, trying to find an image similar to the clothing they wore in 2956, I found [THIS](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/799/303/large/alexey-zaryuta-suits.jpg?1452899650) just take the dark gray and make it white. Add some blue to belt area and the such. Also minus the head gear. They also had random boxes attached. Like on the sides of legs like army pants. On hip and sides of arms. They would keep stuff in these boxes. The casual clothing looked like [THIS](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/68/b4/75/68b4752b3edef0d32097e5de1883aa7a.jpg) only different colors. But the design was similar. Even men wore tight clothes like this with similar designs and colors. But pants.

21. I remember talking about space discoveries with a gentleman named Troy who was from that same year (2956) and he spoke of something called “Boots void” which was a section in space where there seemed to be no stars. He said that it was confirmed to be something like a dark matter / anti matter black hole. One had exploded billions of years ago and as it echoed out into space, would cause whatever Star it hit to eventually convert to an anti matter state and then explode, again echoing out deeper and hitting another and another and another. Causing a chain reaction of explosions wiping out many stars and was still doing so in that year. He said it would take 10s of billions of years before it got anywhere near earth. Was fascinating none the less. Fast forward to the mid 1980s and my friend told me of something that was discovered called “Boötes void” and it sounded similar to what I had mentioned. Fascinating to think about and scary as well.

22. The earths population will be around 15 billion people by 2080s and will peak. Laws will be out in place in some lands but mostly education and opportunity is what settled overpopulation down.

23. As for multiple timelines, they said there are none. Just this one. If I went back and killed my mother before having me, then the timeline updates to that moment and you now have a dead mom and a future me standing there who goes on living. Now you ask but if she’s dead before I existed then how did I grow up to be taken in the first place, and how was I able to come back to kill her? It would be a paradox. But the answer is no. They said it seemed that the universe doesn’t allow paradoxes. Instead what happens is time updates to that very moment. 
This explains the Mandela Effect as well. When time updates, it doesn’t happen instantly. So for a period of time you have two conflicting memories. And it takes a long time to update fully across the whole universe. 

This has happened only once before me. About 80 years ago from a future time. A young man was sent to stop the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. He tried multiple ways but failed. He was young. When that timeline played out it turned out that Lincoln had to be killed so they let it be. This caused that ripple in time where the Mandela Effect happened for the first time ever. Now it’s my turn. But paradoxes aren’t allowed in the universe and they are explainable. Time updates to the moment of intersection.

24. 90% of the things I seen and read about made no sense to me until after I returned and the years passed. Take aids for example. Reading about it in my time, 1975, I had no clue what it was. I read some stuff in it while there but until the 80s, 90s etc finally came after I returned, it then started to make sense. I would check my diary when I seen new technology or events happening. Then at that point I went through it with all of the world. But reading about certain events and things many years before they were to happen just made me log notes about the ones that stood out to me. Me today, of course am aware of them just as you are.

25. A question I keep he trying in messages sent to me is if time travel is public. Or for public use. 
The answer is yes it’s public as in everyone knows about it over the few hundred years, but no it’s not for citizens. Editing the timeline is dangerous. Also it requires a heap of energy stolen from the small black whole outside of our solar system. So not everyone is able to do this. They use it purely for editing time. Now for those saying that they would use it for bad....I don’t know. I was only where I was and could only see what I was allowed to see.

26. They let you keep a diary of information you can’t speak of? No. I began the diary after I returned. This is why it’s hard to name specific things like exact years etc. because 3 months of me reading and learning was just in my head. So by the time I came back I had to try and recall as much as I could. The general information wasn’t hard but things like exact dates were.

27. Dinosaurs. In 2035 scientists in South Korea successfully bring the T-Rex back using its descendants of today, chickens, DNA. The news images i seen of the creature was a very tiny raptor looking creature. brachiosaurus was next on this list but took another several years to produce results from it.

28. Trumps space force is the beginning of these discoveries that will take place in the next 5 and 10 years. I just seen news of more talk about his space force so I thought I’d chime in. I have a good 4 or so pages written up about this very thing that I’ll save for when I release them. 

29. In total, we’ve counted a good 1000ish topics from my diary. So I apologize to anyone who thinks I should have talked about x instead of y. When we made this post I didn’t count on a 100% reveal. So I mentioned the things I mentioned just in passing. At random. Of course there is more things that are greater than some. But there is a LOT so I intentionally am waiting to post those topics with my diary release vs typing all of it here and wasting my own time.

30. A few of you have messaged me about more information regarding the Big Bang discovery. While my pages talk in more detail about it, some things I’m hesitant on mentioning. This discovery alters our world view. It causes mass suicides in the religious areas and others. So for that reason I feel hesitant on saying specifics about what was discovered. All I’ll say is it is “colossal”. If anyone guesses what it is to the T I’ll admit to it. The little bit of light that escaped from this gave us enough to be able to take images. The images the world is presented with is shocking. Nightmareish. If you’re someone who excepts that things in the universe or other universes or even other dimensions would obviously look different than what we expect, you would likely be ok with learning this. But if your worldview is locked tight and if anything shows that your worldview is wrong, would cause you trouble, then it’s not something you’ll wish to know. I’m on the fence about revealing this in detail. So it may or may not happen. Edit: the light that came from this place traveled through the Big Bang shortly after it happened. Echoing out into our universe since the beginning of it. But it’s only seeable through a specific new technique that’s discovered. This is how we are able to see what’s on the other side of the bang. When the universe got to a certain size, I read that THAT is when the light traveling from this place into our universe was clearer. The first light would have been jumbled up but as things cooled in our universe, more light was able to pass through and into our universe. This discovery gives a front row seat as to what’s before the Big Bang and the place our universe sits in. Scary but amazing. 

31. Some of you asked about races. Most of what I seen was Asian and mixed. I seen nearly every race but the majority was Asian and mixed. (Black and white etc) some asked if humans evolved differently. No. Even 1000 years isn’t enough time to evolve. Everyone looked as they do today.

32. Another random entry from my diary. 4 red dots spaced apart equally on the top of your hand is from you being a previous “test” traveler. It means you’ve been there and was sent back after and will either be chosen in the future if needed or not and left alone. The dots on the hand, which I also had received, were from the injection they gave me BEFORE entering the building. They said it was no different then when a person in our time today gets shots to travel to other countries. It helps prevent you from spreading disease. In this case though, it wasn’t to stop them from getting any diseases from me, it was to stop me from getting any kind of sickness from the world around me as I stayed in 2956. So if you have these 4 dots, it means you went through what I did. Only your participation in editing time/the plan will be different.

33. As I read through their public database, I seen news of newspaper being digital. Happened around 2030-2040s. People could get a physical newspaper and it was thin as paper. Had video playing on it. Was touch capable like a phone. They could scroll through articles. Flip the page. (It was only one page folded.)

34. I just want everyone to know that all I’m saying becomes the norm in our future. Right now it all seems fantastical but if we go back 100 years and tell them we hold the worlds knowledge in our pockets in 2020, they too would see that as extreme and science fiction. Me saying we control a black hole or saying that there is something crazy on the other side of the Big Bang, may seem a little out there to you right now. But give it a few decades and these things become the norm. A few hundred years and things like controlling black holes becomes 3rd grade education...so to speak. 
Someone suggested that I eventually take one of my pages and let others study it. To confirm it’s age etc. that I have no problem with. If it helps bring some comfort then I’ll do it.

35. More info about the greys?

I tried searching info about them in their public database but only would ever find news of abductions etc. it seemed as if over the 1000 years, those grey guys worked secretly with the worlds governments. Now, in the year I went the grey dude was out and about. Everyone could see him. So after these catastrophes knocked the world for a loop, they became public knowledge.

From chatting with a couple people who were there, as I had a ton of questions about the little guy, I was met with a somewhat limited set of answers. Which made me think that most was a need-to-know basis type of thing. Mostly on questions about WHY are they here etc. but as for how long they’ve been here, one guy told me they have been here for 10s of thousands of years.

The only thing I know about their biology is they are hybrids. Part bio part machine. They are believed to be the FIRST set of intelligent life forms to happen in the universe. At least in the Milky Way. And he said that is why they look like they do. 

One guy here in Reddit made the point of why must everyone say aliens are humanoids? Two arms, two legs and upright like humans. When they should look completely different etc. we will soon discover that in evolution and natural selection, the humanoid shape is the best shape for life. Even if you were a big, and enough time had passed, you too would begin to evolve upright. Your front two legs would become arms and back becomes legs. I was told think of it like a bubble. ROUND is a natural shape in the universe. In space it’s because gravity is even. So things pack into round shapes. Planets, stars, black holes etc. 
In nature, like a bubble that settles into its most optimized shape, so does evolution paths. Most intelligent species do in fact look humanoid because of this. Evolution naturally favors this upright position and two armed two legged symmetry. It’s the most optimized way to be. 

Also, the grey guys are very child like. The times I seen this one, as the humans were speaking, I would stare at him. He would sometimes see me looking and then, like a child, Rick behind the commander. Peeking slightly around and looking at me. I would at other times see him staring at the kids playing kick ball. Sometimes when just standing there he would sway his arms back and forth. Restless like a child. However, he was stronger than he appeared to be. One time as the commander and the grey dude walked away, someone called over to the commander and both of them looked left at who called, causing the grey guy to walk into a super heavy metal desk. It just moved out of his way like it weighed less than paper. He walked through it instead of bumping it. It took 3 guys to push it back.


36. Some more information I gathered about time, based off some of your questions:
Someone messaged me asking if they can edit time, wouldn’t that mean that other advanced species out in the universe wouldn’t like it due to it also editing their time? Undoing maybe some of their accomplishments?
No. It requires a billion times more energy than what we had to do that. To edit all of the universe. When they do an edit, it does echo out into the galaxy but not far. If you were outside of that area looking in at earth, you would just see it jumping through time. So say an asteroid hits earth and we edit time to undo that. If you were outside of this limit, you would see the asteroid hit...then you’d see the earth instantly be repaired however long after. A better visual example would be if our sun exploded and you’re outside the limit, you would see the explosion...then suddenly the sun is back to normal. Not rewinds back, just instantly. As if skipping scenes in a movie. If you are within the limit then your time gets edited as well. So to avoid this, other species are aware of when an edit will happen so they have time to leave and get to a safe distance. How far? I do not know. 
In order to edit further out I was told they would need more energy than they can get their hands on.

37. Someone messaged me asking more info on a comment where I said white holes are discovered. The science on this is beyond me but the best way I can describe how it was discovered is time. When they take someone from the past and move them to the future, that person isn’t technically traveling forward in time instantly. They remain inside the worm whole for 900 years (for me anyway) as time outside the wormhole ticks normally, the person inside would look frozen in time to them. 900 years ticks by and the frozen in time person comes out. Having instantly traveled from their perspective. Well, this was how white wholes were discovered. Sending someone back into the past the same way, you’re technically traveling through the wormhole faster than light moves. White holes are just black holes that operate backwards in time. This was first spotted when some of their scientists did test runs to the past and could observer the small black hole that’s orbiting our system. It instantly turned white. Because it was operating backwards in time and not forwards. As for white holes naturally in the universe, I have no clue. I can only speak of this one. Basically all black holes are white holes but the catch is that in order for a black hole to become a white whole is if time itself surrounding the black hole begins to tick backwards.",0
Memory from when I was a teenager,"I've been thinking a lot about an experience I had when I was a teenager lately. I've never really told this story to anyone. I just discovered this subreddit last night and after reading about several people's experiences I decided to share mine.

This happened when I was in high school. I was probably around 16 years old. I lived in a small, rural town in Utah with my mom. I'm the youngest of my siblings and was the only child living at home at that time. My mom was a single mother and often worked long hours to make ends meet.

One evening I had just climbed into bed to go to sleep. My bedroom was in the basement of the house and didn't have any windows. There was a family room across the hall from my bedroom with a large window that faced our backyard. If I left my bedroom door open, I could see straight out this window while I was in bed.

Occasionally while I was in bed, I would look out the window and I would see really bright lights that would sort of move from left to right. At first I thought that these lights were coming from cars, but the more I thought about it, it didn't make any sense. Our house was in a pretty heavily wooded area and surrounded by trees on 3 sides. There weren't any roads nearby on that side of the house and the lights seemed too bright and too close to be coming from a car.

One night I was having a hard time sleeping and was staring out the window when I saw the lights. It freaked me out more than normal this time as I couldn't think of any rational explanation for the lights. After I saw them flash by the window a few more times, I got really scared and started hiding under my covers.

After a few minutes, it got too hot, so I decided to peek out from the covers to see if the lights were gone. When I pulled them off of me, I saw my mom standing in the doorway of my bedroom, looking at me. She said something like ""It's ok, sweetie.""

I was kind of confused after she said that. Normally she would go to bed pretty early since she often had to go to work before I would leave for school. It was probably around 11:30 or midnight when this happened, so I was confused about why she was up. I looked at her again and noticed that she looked different. She seemed much longer than normal; her head nearly touched the top of the doorway. Suddenly the bright lights appeared behind her and sort of illuminated her. Her face was all distorted and she didn't look normal.

I was really scared at this point. Before I could react, she vanished and 3 beings appeared where she stood. They glided toward me and pinned me to the bed. I remember feeling these incredibly strong hands pressing down on my arms and legs and my throat. I tried to scream, but before I could get any noise out, they stuffed something into my mouth that went back into my throat. I couldn't breathe. All I could do was thrash and squirm as they held me down.

Suddenly my room got brighter and brighter until it hurt to keep my eyes open. It was like looking at the sun. I never got a good look at the beings that were in my room holding me down. I just remember closing my eyes and struggling to breath, thinking that I was going to die.

And just like that, it was all over. I was suddenly back in my bed and it was morning. I looked at my alarm clock and saw that it was after 7. I could hear my mom upstairs getting ready. I just remember being really scared and unable to move. After a few minutes, I heard my mom yell from upstairs telling me to get up. I tried to respond but it was like my brain was disconnected from my mouth and I couldn't talk.

After a few minutes of lying in bed, my brain sort of ""reconnected"" to my body and I could move again. I then realized I was naked. I usually wore some gym shorts and a t-shirt to bed, so this was unusual. I tried to roll out of bed, but couldn't. I felt an intense pain in my stomach and groin, so I just stayed in bed and started to cry. A few minutes later my mom came downstairs to see why I was still in bed. She seemed kind of mad at first, but then saw that I was crying. I said I didn't feel well. My voice was all raspy and it hurt to talk. She felt my forehead and said I was warm. She said I could stay home from school if I wanted. I nodded yes and then she said she had to leave soon and would call me on her break. She went back upstairs and left a few minutes later.

I tried getting off of my bed, but my stomach hurt so bad that it was agony to even move. After a few minutes, I managed to climb out of bed and spotted my clothes from the night before in a pile on my floor. I hobbled over and picked them up. They felt really warm and smelled strange, kind of like a burnt, metallic smell.

All of the sudden I felt really ill and went to the bathroom. I threw up in the toilet a ton of clear liquid, and some of my dinner from the night before. There was also this weird dark, gray metallic object in the toilet that I had thrown up. It was shaped like a cylinder and about the size of a tic tac. I had no idea what it was. I wish I would have scooped it out, but I decided to just flush the toilet.

After about 30 minutes or so, my body felt normal again, but I was still confused and frightened about what had happened that night. I pretty much just stayed in bed that whole day. I eventually went to sleep and stayed asleep for most of the day. My mom called several times, but I didn't hear the phone. She ended up coming home from work early to check on me.

From that day on, I never saw the lights outside the window again. I still have no idea what happened or if it was all a dream, but it freaks me out to think about it. Sorry for the long post, but it feels good to finally tell someone about this.",0
Alien abductions,"I figured id post here to tell you my story.

I was in elementry school in the 90s or maybe it was middle school.. 

Reguardless

I was asleep on the couch in the living room one night and I felt a tap tap on my left shoulder.

I turn to see a blurry figure standing there.. not one but 2.  They were long, slender and grey wearing metalic like suits.

They had no ears or a mouth that I could see.  

I just remeber being scared and I turned back around to go to sleep.

The next thing I remeber was a more forceble tap on my shoulder forcing me back around.  I had no choice but to open my eyes.

I put my glasses on to see the 2 slender aliens looking at me.

I coudnt hear them but yet I COULD hear them..more like telepathy idk..

They wanted me to go with them.. i said... i called out for my parents but no one responded.  It was as if time just stopped.

I said let me get changed first.  The followed me downstairs.... i dont remeber much of getting changed but I did bring a cd of pop music with me.


My next scene was on the space craft.  

I was looking into space..

Controll room with others like them.

Metalic and very futuristic with a long control panel.  I said here... gave them my cd and they popped it in to play it only for me to hear a loud screaching noise.. they  forcefully gave it back to me... i guess rhey didnt like it.

I remeber my hair was a mess... and I asked a billion questions.. whats this?  Where are we going?  Who are you?  Ect...

We passed every planet till we flew to the back side of mars.


I dont remeber the landing but I do remember seeing a hanger with other ships just like the one I was on and other aliens... about like walking down a city street crowded.

One on my left one on my right..

The building or hanger was shiny.

Two big pillars like all metalic and rectagle stood a each side of the hanger with other ships.

The floors were metalic like as well.

The nexy thing I heard was you will soon become one of us.

I remeber telling them that I dont wanna be one of you.. I wanna go home.

The next thing I remeber was waking up in my parents bedroom in there bed.  I remeber saying Mom?  She said yes?  But I coudnt move my body or my mouth.  I was in some sort of peralises mode.

I told her about i coudnt move.  She said only old people get that.  Your too young to of gotten that.


That was the first abduction

The second time was MANY years later.

We were driving home from dinner and I happened to look up and saw weird lights following me.  I had the feeling I shoudnt of looked so I didnt.

We got home.  By now I sleep downstairs in my room. 

It was semi late at night.  I was awaken by a light shining through my window.  I saw this thing hovering and peering through at me.  It saw me and floated away.

I remeber hearing a humming noise.  I had this strange feeling.  I go and lock my door.  As soon as I did.. only 2 to 3 min later.. it rattled.  I opened my window and crawed out.  I remsmber running to my neighbors house and knocking on the door.  No one answered.  And I ran to my other neighbors... that all I remeber..  I woke up in my laun. Room on the floor with loss of time.. I didnt remember anything but had this fear of looking at the night sky as they were watching me


And my final obduction..

I just remeber hearing that humming noise from my room..  I again locked my door... i tried to hide in my closet.. then under my bed.. when they were not looking I ran... I called for my parents but no one could hear me.. i unlocked the front door, closing it from behind and hid in my parents Mercury Grand Marque.... I was scared.. the last thing I remeber was they found me looking through the back seet window left side.. i said please dont take me.. please no.. and I woke up outside the house in a different car.. 

I remeber getting up and going back inside... esely in the am.... not remebering how I ended up there.  

I know my storys are long but I was wondering if anyone else had abduction stories sim to mine.. im at that point in my life im not afraid to talk about it.

I did report to mufon a while back but they coudnt find snt reports of ufo activity in the area at that time.  Perhaps I got the year and month wrong?  I dont know.

I wanna know others who may have experienced what I have.. I dont wanna feel alone and being told its all a dream.. you made it all up.


UPDATE:

I also wanted to mention one thing I didnt mention before.  

Iv noticed whenever I talk about this in person to someone, I get weird feelings of being watched or I end up with vivid weird dreams. 

One occassion happened 2 weekends ago on a Saturday.  I mentioned it to someone and i also yelled im not afraid anymore... and spoke out in the open about it as if they could hear me.

I went to sleep.

I had a weird dream..

All I can remeber was waking up to that same forceful touch I felt all those years ago.. I was sweating... 

I didnt sleep that night.",0

Psychedelics and abduction,"

Less than a year ago I had an experience with what seemed to be extraterrestrials. I was under the influence of a high dose of mushrooms and a high dose of ketamine around the time that the experience happened, but the strange thing is that I cannot place exactly when it happened because it seemed to happen outside of time itself. I'm not saying that this was 100% a genuine alien abduction experience, but the experience was certainly more than the effects of the drugs. 

The trip itself was done for spiritual/exploratory purposes. I wasn't just getting high. It was done alone in silent darkness (McKenna style plus ketamine). At the peak of the mushroom trip I insufflated enough ketamine for a k-hole experience. I'm experienced with both mushrooms and ketamine, but what happened was outside the realm of anything I had ever experienced on either of those substances. 

It began like I expected (lights, colors, sounds, the sensation of motion and the experience of being somewhere unfamiliar.) I met the typical psychedelic entities (much like those on dmt). But then there's a huge gap where I don't know what happened. I remember coming out of the room once the ketamine had worn off and the peak was over. I was laughing hysterically at existence itself and was overcome with the typical feeling of cosmic consciousness/one with the universe/whatever you want to call it. 

But then when I woke up the next morning, the memory of the extraterrestrial experience flooded my mind. I remembered that sometime during the trip everything went black. I woke up on a table in a white room. There were no more trippy visuals. My ego was completely intact and I felt completely like myself. I realized that I was unable to move very much, as if I was strapped to the table. I looked up and there were three creatures above me, looking down at me.

They were tall and slim. Their skin was almost transparent and a light gray color. They had large black eyes and no nose or mouth. I started freaking out and trying to break free. I remember having the particular sensation of being an animal under the microscope of a much more powerful being. I was terrified. Then, immediately, the creatures communicated with me telepathically. They told me to calm down. They said that they weren't going to hurt me, but that they were just curious. I was suddenly calm and really sleepy. I felt warm and numb, almost as if I had been drugged or anesthetized. Then everything went black. 

I didn't remember this until the next morning, but I know that it happened sometime during the trip. The strange thing is that it felt like it happened outside of time. I can't place exactly when it happened or how long it took. The experience really shook me up. I kind of blew it off as the effects of the drugs, but over the months since it happened, I can't get it out of my head. I've read many abduction stories since then and it's so similar to many I've read. I've also read what Carl Jung writes about alien experiences. 

Whether the experience was actual aliens or a projection of something within myself that i perceive as being so foreign that I have to project it onto an alien experience, I can't say for sure. All I know is that I want to learn more about the experience. I want to contact whatever this was that I encountered. Of course, I want it to be real aliens because that is fucking awesome but if it's something psychological than I'm just as interested. I honestly don't think that the two are mutually exclusive, but who knows. 

I wonder if anyone here has had any similar experiences or know of any good resources for learning more about these phenomenon. There are so many shitty alien websites. I want to contact these entities again just out of curiosity. I also want to be sure to be really grounded before I do any of this because this stuff definitely has the potential to mess with my perception of reality if I take it too far.

getting used to it,"Recently after years of reading up on alien life it has dawned on my that there are many many alien races.  I feel confident in this by means of the testimonies of astronauts and other scientists and thinkers.  Once you get used to that idea then you can accept these 'people' just like we would accept other races here on earth.  Then it loses most of its wonder and awe.  Like wtf, the universe is a huge place so why should there not be others out there.  They won't look like humans maybe but still. . . As some have said we all have the same core existence of consciousness and so we are all one in the larger sense.  That dampens a lot of the fear.  But... still just like in real life there are those who are not so nice and who would hurt us if they could.  To me it seems okay to desire contact with these exterrestrials but at the same time it's wise to invoke protection by means of affirmations, prayers etc.  Like if these aliens can come into your home and just take you and you have no means of stopping them-well that leave us with the what ya gonna do to stop it?   These beings may have been here since the birth of mankind so in the largest sense what they are doing may not be a bad thing, just that in the process the abducted person can endure suffering.",0
My experiences with abduction,"I thought about posting on a throwaway, but I don't really care. So, my first encounter happened when I was around 6 or 7. I was living with my grandparents at the time, I remember running into their room late at night because I had a nightmare. They set up a small cot next to their bed and I fell back asleep. I was woken up by what I thought was rain splatting against the window, but then I saw shadows moving around and there was no rain. Suddenly I was aware of ""people"" outside my grandparents bedroom ""talking"". Their language was rythmic, It sounded like what I can only describe as a marching band, but clicky in a way. Then, nothing. 

A few years later and I was living with my mom. My brother at my dads. They took me so many times, it almost seems like my childhood is a blur, my memory is really spotty so forgive me if this isnt super detailed. I remember when I would stay at my dads, they would come very late at night and I would think, oh it's a train, only there were no trains nearby. One time, I showed up at my dads for my weekend visit and my brother told me that some men came into his room one night looking for me. Another time at my dads, I was just about to fall asleep when I became aware of someone in my room, the next  thing I know, it was like I fell into my bed and my mouth was bleeding a LOT.

I only had two experiences at my moms. The first, I was up late reading a book when I got the feeling I was being watched, I looked up and there was a small face staring at me through the cracked door. Next thing I know, It's morning. The second, I was really sick and I was sleeping in my moms bed, my brother was sleeping out in the living room. I remember hearing what sounded like two people walking around out there and my mom started freaking out, saying stuff like ""I wont let them take you"" I woke up the next day and I wasn't sick anymore.

Once I became an adult, the encounters stopped for a realllllly long time. Around 7 years ago, I was living with my girlfriend at the time. One week, while she was on a work trip out of state, I fell asleep on the couch in the living room. It was in the middle of summer so all the windows were open. I heard a loud noise outside, then lights. I assumed it was a car at the time and I thought to myself that it was my dad. Two problems with that. My house was in the middle of nowhere so it wouldnt have been a car and my dad lived in Arizona, about a 24 hour drive from there. I have no idea why my brain made the association that it was my dad. Then about a month later, gf and I are in bed, were both trying to sleep when all of a sudden, there is a huge flash of light and I caught a glimpse of two figures at the foot of the bed. The next morning, I ask her if she saw that and she said yes, she had seen the light, gotten scared and rolled over to wake me up but I was gone, she said she went out in the living room and I was nowhere to be found. Then she said she remembers thinking, ""oh hell be back"" then went back to sleep!! 

That's pretty much it for me, except for last night, I woke up a bunch due to nightmares, then around 4 am, I feel someone shaking me, I roll over and I see this small person with hair covering their face standing directly over me!! I panic and start screaming bloody murder! I was terrified, then I realize it's my roommates girlfriend. I was so embarrassed. Sorry for the long post!",0

3/3 siblings abducted possibly for fucked up genetics,"Last year I posted my possible abuction story with my youngest brother (Danny). Long story short, it was the scariest night of my life without seeing what we were up against. I felt it strengthened our sibling bond although I felt relieved at least one of us was spared.

While casually talking to my other [the spared] brother (Carl) about dreams, he said ""Hey remember that one time when we were young, I dreamed there were three kids in costume trying to corner me? It's so weird that it's so clear it feels like a memory."" I told him to describe the ""kids"" to us again, and as he did, his face started to twist into horror the same time as mine. His description was basically grey aliens and he just realized it after all these years!  He said there were three of them who have cornered him against the bedroom wall (one was holding a syringe). Somehow they were telling him to calm down because they just need a blood sample. So nope, no one was spared afterall.

That was how we got convinced 3/3 of us have most likely been abducted.

The other night, Carl texted me while I was at my girlfriend's. He was panicking because something was violently vibrating inside his leg. He said it was nothing like a spasm but more like a phone set in silent vibrating from a call. He said whatever it was felt tiny and couldn't be felt by his finger. He didn't tell Dan because he didn't want to scare him at midnight, being in the countryside practically alone with our grandma.

Just 3 hours after Carl's texts, Dan called me freaking out. He said something's vibrating inside his nape and described it exactly as Carl described his. 

There are also things that freak me out most likely related to our possible abduction:

-Our dad says since he was a kid he's been seeing blond people outside his window looking at him [he said they looked exactly like these](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTEX8s0hsePh-rOGicU8xxwLjMtFX0ht5eW5aLjO1mzKlLDmPvk). (Many reported abductees have ascendants or descendants who were observed as well. Maybe our dad's a subject too?)

-Our paternal side of genetics is FUCKED UP. My dad came from at least 3 generations of inbreeding. (Wealthy European family in a colonial country, so for wealth-preservation). My clan is plagued by ultra rare cancers, physical deformities, and even internal mutations so my theory is we're being studied for this.

-We've been seeing UFOs since we were kids. One time, we had a new pretty powerful camera and we successfully shot tons of photos and videos of them. By morning, they were gone from the camera! Like somebody snuck in our house to delete JUST those proofs.

-Carl and I have insane streetlight interference. Streetlights turn off when we walk under them. Even streetlights that have been dead for months will turn on only during the moment we walk under them.

-In Dan's case, transistor radios go static when he goes near them.

Our uncle is a radiologist so we asked him to xray us to look for implanted chips or capsules but he found nothing. We're afraid we will experience a worse abduction but honestly what can be done?",0
Scary Encounter,"I'll start by saying that maybe I'm crazy, but this was all so unbelievably real, it would be harder for me to prove it to be untrue.

I woke up in a golden or brass room. There was a giant ornate pillar in the center and metallic pedestal-like beds surrounding it. I was laying on one of the beds naked with my head pointing towards the pillar. There were a few others around me on other beds but I didn't recognize them.

There was an upper level of this room where dozens of observers were standing like in a surgery theater. 

They said they needed my blood and I asked if it would hurt, and they said that it would, very much so. 

I felt a pressure on my back where my solar plexus is, then heard a popping noise as a golden spike pressed into my back and I saw it push up against the skin of my stomach but it didn't pierce completely through. It was beyond painful but I couldn't move or scream.

It was happening to the others too but they didn't seem to react.

I woke up in my bed in a cold sweat and my back was cramping and in pain, but I had no marks anywhere on my body.

All in all, a terrifying and bizarre experience. It probably was a dream, but it just felt so real.",0

Hooded figure seen outside bedroom window,"Any one else seen the hooded figures looking in window??  This happened before a bad experience

I climbed into bed and turned off the lamp laying on my right side with my back to the window, on the opposite side of the room was my dressing table that was facing the window , so i could actually see my bedroom window through the dressing table mirror,..well for a split second there was a hooded figure looking in the window. I jumped up and turned to look behind me and it had gone. husband was working nights and my children were all sleeping.i was petrified shaking and sweating at what i had seen...few months after that i had a terrible abduction experience..while my husband was laying at side of me in bed

That night we all went to bed around 9 iI lay there for a while watching the clock change and looking at the rain hitting the window.i don't remember everything but i know i couldn't move or scream and i was by then laying on my back my husband was just at side of me with staring eyes and mouth open.i could hear my heart beating in my ears and felt tremendous pain in my forehead while having a jelly like substance forced down my throat as i tried to scream, then i started moving towards my bedroom ceiling...thinking im gonna be crushed to death,but instead i went right through it.. next thing i know i was floating a few inches above the ground outside and could also feel the rain on my body..then started to rise up ..i must have passed out as i don't remember much after that.the next day  a friend said whats happened to your forehead?? i had a small bruise right in the centre of my forehead my husband never wants to speak about it and tries to laugh it off for weeks i felt ill and had head aches

This happened to me in 1994 and ever since that night i have been a vegetarian...and iv had other experiences since. Not something you would go tell your neighbour to be honest  there's been few unexplained things that il not go into just now ..but thanks for reading",0

I've been abducted more than once.,"To start off, some my abductions come in the form of dreams and some are awake. I've had countless dreams over my life with Alien's and UFO's. Below are the ones that I believe I made real contact:

* I saw Orion's belt in the distance (not the first time I've seen this in past dreams). I then saw a UFO drop from Orion's belt to below the horizon. I started to head towards my brother who was about 150 yards away from me to tell him what I saw. As I head over I start to float up. I start yelling at him to get his attention, yet he couldn't hear me. I next remember being paralyzed on my side. I can see the earth below me, the sun in the distance and this mind boggling huge UFO. I mean fucking massive!! I'm now inside the mother ship in the same paralyzed position as I was before. I'm in this huge poorly lit room, hard to describe. Near me in my vision is this blank screen. Then appearing on the screen was a few speaker looking things, black and red in color. It then went blank and came back as this crazy hexagon kaleidoscope type design, yellow and orange in color with numbers inside counting extremely fast. While laying there it truly felt as if I was there in the flesh. I was able to look around with my eyes, blink, but not move because I was scared to try. I kept thinking that I want to be back in my bed because fuck this shit. I heard this sound (hard to describe) and was transferred to my bed and in that same position in a sweat, awake. It was weird, I never woke up in my bed, I was just there. I couldn't fall back asleep.

* All I could see was complete white, and for some reason I can only think of is pi. I saw a weird spiral of numbers that kept on going forever. That came in and out of my visions a few times. The with that white background I saw a silhouette of a grey, they did something with my brain (it never hurt, it just felt mushy?). I heard odd breathing to my left, I jolted and woke in my bed.

* One grey was over top of me in my bed (he was blurry and I couldn't make out details) and he said to me everything will be alright. He disappeared then there were two more figures at the end of my bed, and they raced to the head side of my bed. All I can remember.

* I remember being in this floating thing inside one of their hallways. I couldn't see anything around me, I was just floating facing down and all I could see was the floor and two sets of legs on either side of me. Their legs were human like yet different, they were skinny and long. We stopped at a door way and that's all I can remember.

* I don't recall how I got into this position, but I was in an awake state floating over my bed rotating clockwise. Then I heard a voice in my head, sounded male and sort of robotic. He said something like 'I was picked a long time ago for this life, we have been watching over you ever since, and you are dong a good job.' I tried to talk back, I really wanted a name, who are they? But no sound was coming out. Only air was leaving my mouth. That's how I know I was awake, I could feel the air leave my mouth with saliva.

* I was sleeping on the couch. Again had that floating sensation, briefly this time. There was a dim light in the hallway towards the left of my vision. The grey was on my right, it was completely dark there, and I couldn't see him. He said hello, I said hello back (this blew my mind, I was able to talk back). Then he said a few things and all I can remember was something about ""you've been chosen 'Ho_Phat' or you are the chosen one 'Ho_phat,'"" he said my name!! I then reached out my hand and was able to grab a hold of his hand, he had longer and thicker than normal fingers, they felt smooth and just like skin. I was super excited and started to give him high fives hahah. I then waved and said goodbye and he said goodbye and left.

* I was in this really dark room, there was one white light by my feet. I saw a silhouette of a small grey to my lower right side. I saw his almond shaped eyes, the eyes were white. I was able to reach out my hand in front of me, the grey grabbed my hand and got super excited and started to go around me. My energy felt super charged, I kept saying I want to help Earth, it literally felt like my energy blanketed the Earth with love. Absolutely unreal experience, I'll never forget (I actually use this feeling when I meditate still). Next thing I know I got poked in my lower right ab area, near the belly button. I didn't like it and woke up. Oddly enough for weeks it felt sore there, but no marks.

* This one I was awake for. I felt a pressure push me to the bed, every inch of my body was being pushed down by a force. I started to freak out, close my eyes and sweat like crazy. I opened them and saw a Grey's mouth right beside my eyes trying to talk to me, but no sound came out. It seemed like there was some sort of blue force between him and me. I closed my eyes again, and he left a bit after that. I got out of bed and was freaking out... I couldn't sleep after that. I ended up falling asleep a later, woke up and I saw a tall grey standing in the corner of my room. I just rolled over and went to sleep like it was normal.

With all this I wanted to get answers, so me and a friend one night went out star gazing with the intention on seeing if we can get some sort of conclusion. The night was a clear, no clouds at all. The moon was full and bright. It was about 2330, my friend and I were both looking towards the moon. Then all of a sudden 3 lights appeared right beside the moon, forming an upside down triangle. These lights were a pure white, just as bright or slightly brighter than the moon. My friend and I were both gobsmacked at this sight, we couldn't take our eyes off this. About 5 seconds later the top 2 lights faded out quite quickly, the bottom light stayed lit till the top 2 were gone. Then the bottom light slowly moved up in a squiggly line leaving a very faint light trail while fading away.

I'm not really sure what to say. I know they are here, I get the feeling I am being looked after. They have actually been a positive influence on my life here. I hope this helps others.",0
I think I was abducted once," 

It's kind of a long story, but one night I went to bed and after falling asleep I entered into the most surreal dream I have ever had.

My dream started off as I was descending from the Sky onto another planet entirely, I definitely was not on Earth anymore, and I found myself in this super futuristic looking glass city. The only thing I have ever seen that resembles this cities buildings is this: [https://www.google.com/search?q=worlds+largest+buildings&rlz=1C1CHBF\_enUS845US845&hl=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjUvLPsouPnAhXSop4KHQRAC7sQ\_AUoAXoECA8QAw&biw=1743&bih=719#imgrc=dUqy0N-n25jCpM](https://www.google.com/search?q=worlds+largest+buildings&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS845US845&hl=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjUvLPsouPnAhXSop4KHQRAC7sQ_AUoAXoECA8QAw&biw=1743&bih=719#imgrc=dUqy0N-n25jCpM)

As I was hovering over the city, I saw that the city was surrounded by luscious green trees and vegetation, but not like the trees we have on Earth, everything was so green, vibrant and alive. I was taken down to the people and they all were wearing these super futuristic looking clothes with purple hues and and robes.. they didn't look like robes per say, they kind of looked like what Royal people would wear just more slim fitting and attractive looking. They had these types of devices with them that would allow them to all be interconnected and up to date on what everyone else was doing.. it was like they had a hive-mind conscience and everyone was connected.

They were all super intelligent and the things I was looking at were wayyy beyond my human comprehension.. I could try to explain what I saw but it would be like a person from 300 years ago trying to describe what a microwave was doing.. it makes no sense. They had this thing implanted on the top of mountainside away from the city that looked like it was drilling into the mountain (No idea what this was.) They pathways they walked in were illuminated.. kind of like it had a glow to it, or energy. Everything was made out of glass and crystals and this kind of mesh that kept it together strongly.

After viewing the city and such, I was sucked back into a craft and we shot away form this planet. I then found myself hovering above london in the UFO. I remember thinking in my dream, that the people down there have no idea that we exist in this craft above them.. and I found it awe inspiring that I could watch remotely from above without anyone noticing me. Then the UFO beamed me towards Earth and I shot back into my body and woke up.

Has anyone experienced something like this? Where they are taken somewhere else and get dropped back off? All in all, whether it was a dream, or some form of mental experience, It was very fluid, fun, and energizing.

I didn't get anally probed though :/",0

Asking for your input,"I am compelled to make a specific forum, but I should ask my most trusted communities if such a one already exists. I hope to make a place where only human brains interact, albeit electronically. There will be no quotes, no links, and no memes. Only people can connect there, and even if they disagree, there's no running to Google to sort it out. If someone is unsure, they should say so. We are taught to quote movies, television shows, radio personalities, to link our thoughts with an article written by another person, and to run to a search engine when we are unsure. Spell check is the only thing that keeps us from barely knowing how to write. I just used it 10 times. We need a place where we can shed recycled thought and mass-produced opinion. Does anywhere on Reddit already resemble this? I need a place where humans prove that we can organically communicate, even in electronic form.",0
Made detailed 3D model of grey I saw + stuff about greys,"**ETA**: I forgot to say, but if any of you have questions you would like me to ask this 'one' collective the next time they come knocking, drop it in the comments and I'll make a list. I'm terrible about thinking up questions to ask in the moment.

Hello again,

I posted last month about some missing time and seeing a grey in November. I made a very crude sketch at the time but had several free hours this weekend, so I made a detailed 3D model of the alien I saw using a digital sculpting app.

I am >90% confident that I've accurately reproduced what I saw, the only part I really struggled with is exactly how the frontal bone/orbital socket area works with their weird eyes. I am an amateur sculptor so I guess I'm lucky that I am familiar enough with bone structure to give it my best guess, but the eyes are so strange. Still, the results are very, very, very close to what I saw.

Also, I channeled something again earlier this month that wanted to talk about greys, presumably because I was thinking about them so much. It's not exactly a warm-fuzzy conversation and I don't know what I think about it all yet, but it's there for anyone who cares to check it out.

I attempted to channel with this group over the weekend and they connected only long enough to reject the request, stating essentially that it wasn't a good time to talk. They stopped even saying that after I tried a few more times and they kept rejecting it, so idk. I might try again tonight if I'm not too tired after work.

Here are the links. Don't freak out about the URL, I have everything set to free/public.

Anybody with a personal abduction story in México?,"Tengo en mi memoria un recuerdo difuso que vuelve a mi cabeza cada cierto tiempo.

En mi recuerdo tengo alrededor de nueve años, en ese tiempo compartía habitación con mi hermano pequeño de cinco años de edad.

Era una habitación pequeña del típico fraccionamiento de infonavit. La única ventana de la habitación daba al pequeño porche al frente de la casa.

Despierto en la madrugada por la necesidad de ir a orinar, al abrir los ojos veo una luz intensa que entra por la ventana. Salgo de la habitación pensando en que después de orinar iría a buscar el porqué de ese destello que no bajaba su intensidad, pero pospuse el ir al baño porque me doy cuenta que la puerta de la casa está totalmente abierta, lugar por el que también entra bastante luz.

Me dirijo a la puerta para ver qué era lo que sucedía afuera mientras escucho un sonido extraño que proviente también del exterior a un volumen intenso, pero sin ensordecer totalmente mi oído, era un sonido que compararía con una turbina enorme,  una lavadora, o algo similar, como algo que gira, algo que se acerca y aleja constantemente.

Al llegar a la puerta veo al cielo y sin más, veo el típico platillo volador en forma de disco, tenía un tamaño considerablemente grande y estaba suspendido ridículamente cerca de mi casa, diría que a no más de 10 metros del techo. El disco se encontraba inclinado sobre mi casa como a 45 grados, es decir, había una parte de el muy cerca del suelo y el otro extremo apuntando al cielo, la parte de abajo daba justo hacía mi casa, y el sonido que había escuchado derrepente unos momentos atrás, lo hacían unos circulos de luz que giraban en la base alrededor del diámetro del disco. 

Cuando vi eso,  una única luz me cegó y lo próximo que recuerdo es que entro a la habitación de nuevo,  mí hermano está sentado en su cama tallando sus ojos y me pregunta: ¿A dónde fuiste?, a lo que respondo que fui a orinar. Me dice que no, porque él también despertó cuando me escuchó salir de la habitación, después de ""un rato"" y no escuchar que volviera, sintió miedo de estar solo y fue a buscarme al baño (como dije, él tenía cinco años de edad aproximadamente), cuando llegó al baño no me encontró allí y regresó a la habitación. Me dijo que acababa de entrar al cuarto y sentarse en su cama cuando entré casi detrás de él. 

Mientras mi hermano me cuenta que salió a buscarme, yo no recordaba nada acerca de las luces, ni la nave, yo me metía en mi cama de vuelta pensando que volvía del baño y que tal vez mi hermano acababa de despertar teniendo una pesadilla. Recuerdo finalmente asomarme por la ventana sin motivo aparente, y veo que el cielo estaba tornándose claro, estaba amaneciendo.

No sé con exactitud a que edad me invadió ese recuerdo por primera vez, pero siendo ya un adolescente fue que las imágenes de las luces y el disco llegaron a completar esta anécdota/sueño/recuerdo.

Eso es todo, he pensado mucho que tal vez fue un sueño, porque sí sueño de vez en cuando con lo mismo en la actualidad, pero recuerdo todo tan bien y exactamente igual estando despierto, haciendo cualquier actividad, que lo siento más como un recuerdo difuso de la infancia.

Hace unos años, le pregunté a mi hermano si recordaba algo más de esa noche (dándo por hecho, sin sentido, que él lo recordaría igual de claro que yo, me refiero al orden de los hechos) pero ni siquiera recuerda haber despertado de pequelo y haber vivido aquello. 

En fin, solo quería compartirlo. No doy por hecho nada, ni intento convencer a nadie de nada. Solo compartirlo.",0

Do you know someone that was ABDUCTED? WENT MISSING FOR DAYS? WAS ATTACKED? SHOT AT? Had a POISONESS GAS/ANTHRAX SCARE? Looking for individuals and law enforcement to share their stories on camera for a new criminal docuseries series being produced by an Emmy award winning company.,"Hello Everybody..

I am in search for some **real-life, personal accounts for on-camera interviews** for a criminal docuseries series being produced by an Emmy award winning company.

If you or someone you know has experienced a situation that you’d be willing to talk about and/or would like your story told, we would love to interview you. We are also interested in speaking with those with a background in law enforcement, military, SWAT, self defense, survivalists, and others that may not have personally experienced these situations but are professionally trained to respond to them.

We are looking specifically for the following:

1). Someone who has had their child or a friend abducted in a car, and they know who took them. (If police could find the car, they would find the abductee)

2). Someone has gotten lost themself, or been looking for someone who has gotten lost/missing where the lost person didn’t have any cell phone signal. (Phone wasn’t dead, but out of range to contact anyone)

3). Someone who was going somewhere at night and was attacked out of the dark or concealment.

4). Someone who works at a business and had a disgruntled employee/agitated customer/or angry personal connection (like a partner that was just broken up with) show up at the business and cause violence. (The idea is that the person coming back was a “red flag” before they showed up and caused a disaster)

5) Someone who was put in a harrowing situation because they encountered someone who had a concealed gun.

6) Someone who was attacked, and their attacker had a prior violent arrest history

7). Someone was has been targeted by ant type of biological or chemical attack

8). Someone has gotten lost themself, or been looking for someone who has gotten lost/missing where helicopters were NOT used to help search, and if they had been, it would have helped. (Episode is about trying to use drones for search and rescue in areas that either don’t have the budget for helicopters, or getting a helicopter there from far away takes too long)

DM/Email me or comment below if you or someone you know might have a personal story they'd be willing and comfortable sharing. They would be communicating directly with myself. SF, LA & Las Vegas locals preferred but open to anyone in the continental United States. Requirments would be a few hours of the individuals time (\~2 hours). Supporting videos, photos and visual aid are a **major plus**. We are a bare bones crew and are able to come to you directly or at agreed upon location.

It's been a slow burn up till this point, where we're really transitioning to the full-on gonzo insanity we've imagined from the start and it's been so much fun to see this come together (I'm the writer, the artist and colorist are tremendous). It's our first major piece to put out and we're getting close to finished which is thrilling, but definitely need feedback. If you read it and have opinions, please hit me up, either in the comments section here or DM.

What is your personal Abduction story,What was the most intense Alien Encounter you ever had?,0
Megan Blewett Abduction File: Recorded 2/15-16/2017,"Hello, this is a story of an old friend of mine and my experiences questioning her. I want to delete the document but don't want the information to be lost, so I am posting it here. I apologize for any grammatical errors.  


Megan has a reoccurring nightmare, total number of times is a handful. Last incident was after getting drunk at applebees. 

This dream causes her intense fear, and hurts her head to remember. As if needles were pressing into the area of her forehead between her eyebrows.

She seems to need alcohol to remember. 

This Is the dream she has, a repressed memory.

She is four years old and she sees a large, close glowing green light in the field near her house. She climbs out her window onto the roof and jumps down to the ground. 

She is in the field and there is an intense smell of alcohol, specifically beer (potentially why she is allergic and needs it to remember). Begins running home, when she runs into an invisible wall and stumbles backwards, as she puts out her arms falling backwards she does not hit the ground but instead gets pulled into the craft over her, the craft looks like a glowing green clam with no light source, just radiating light. She begins feeling intense pressure and heat squeezing her equally all over. Described as “so hot that sweat would evaporate”. 

Next thing she knows she her hair is being brushed out of the way as to lie her down on a very soft operating table. Surrounding her are Grey/blueish, opaque, fluid like creatures with long necks, in a brightly lit room. In this room there are two structural columns that seem to be steel but grown over like an abandoned city. In the back of the room there is a one of the creatures, never moving, only watching the operation. It makes her feel afraid of him. Their wastes seemed to be higher than the table she was on. She would not stop talking but seemed to understand was going on through mental updates but without hearing words. She hears a consistent clicking noise inside their bodies. They are like water, when they need a face they just form it around the neck column, when they need hands they form them like water forms a path when spilled. The atmosphere was if they were trying to calm her, and she felt calm. 

They bent and moved all her limbs, turning her head left and right. She recalls them touching her stomach at some point but is sure her chest and in between legs were not touched. On her left are there is a metal retracting cast. Her arm has the palm facing up and what appears to be forceps spreading her arm open. She remembers her left arm hurting a lot. 

At the end a smaller lumpy block entered the room, it barely being taller than the table. It moved like water but made the sound as if a centipede was walking. The noise drove her crazy, but it made rumbling internal noise instead of the clicking. IT did not make her feel at ease, but it came to her arm and made her arm not hurt. Then it pressed the area on her forehead between her eyebrows and next thing she knew she was back in her bed. 

Current Condition:

She says it feels like needles in pressing into the forehead, between eyebrows location on her head when she tries to remember, upon remembering she feels intense fear. Her eyes would stare off in the distance, mouth will tremble, and is unable to speak loudly. Had an instance of forgetting that she was unresponsive for 3 minutes during conversation. Has said that the fear she feels may be something they make her feel and not that she is actually scared. Is scared of me sharing this info, with fear that someone will come take her away.

She has a scar on her left arm in the location of the surgery. Has said that sometimes her freckles hurt. She says that when she presses it, she feels nothing underneath the skin. 

Session ended at 5:30AM at her location, phone call was hung up at some point after I fell asleep (She says she left the call going). She awoke at 10:30AM her time and in her rush she noticed her arm was bleeding in the same location (exact location, it is the scar just longer) of her freckles where they operated, she ran it under a faucet and put a Band-Aid on it. The image looks like a scratch but she describes it as a pain in the bones of that location. (they may have removed the implanted device after her recalling the abduction) This night she describes her dream as, “Mmm I had a really horrible dream where all I heard was just a nasty drone noise and some ticking.” These noises most likely were the drone noise of the craft of the box creature and the clicking of the long neck creatures. Upon questioning her if she remembered she is unable to recall a single detail of the discussion about the abduction but can clearly recall all other bits of our conversation (bits I used to distract her when she became overly fearful) 

Says her Ex (lives in the same house) woke up and went to work at 7AM. Says he felt unwell and has migraines currently. Which if he was involved means they did a rushed job between 5:00AM and 7:00AM. Call was dropped at 1:18 AM my time, thus 6:18 AM her time, I am naming this the time of the second abduction.

Upon showing her this recorded information, her head hurt in the same location, her eyes fluctuated, confirms that she does not remember saying it but says the info is familiar. She kept looking back at her scar baffled. Conversation afterwards especially the part discussing telling others made her very scared and she spaced out again looking fearful.

Describes wound on arm during and now the same, stinging. Says it doesn’t hurt the outside to touch. Had x-ray before for breaking arm and saw nothing there. 

Happened at night

Everywhere was light kind of green, comfiest bed in the world 

Up was a purple kind of uv color

\[Something else was in corner, it was next to him. He wasn’t scary it was whatever was next to him, she could see flicker like a black mask, might have been a weapon\]

They had active air bases near and she was always fascinated by them and she’d go out at night to go look at them, was not in room couldn’t have gotten out, she remembered that the room she thought she was in was her brothers, her bed was at front of house so she could not have gotten out of it, she couldn’t even reach door handles? Mom always made sure door was locked, mom would have known she was up due to creaky house, and they were all light sleepers. She still remembers being in the field and remembered needing to go home due to time. Was sure she was running but thought she was playing. Know she was having “fun”, it was dark, it was a clear night. Flowers on the left, right hand side tall crops she liked hiding in to pop out and scare people.

"Lost two days, saw a gray, and channeled lots of info from something"," Some stuff has happened since my last post here and I thought I'd share an update.

TL;DR:

\- Unintentional astral projection in mid-November. Saw gray alien. Pic below.

\- Missing the entire following Thursday.

\- The next week was Thanksgiving in the US, everything was normal.

\- Missing entire Thursday following Thanksgiving.

\- No more missing days after that second Thursday. First time this has ever happened to me.

\- In early December I started unintentionally channeling something. I got answers to some small questions about aliens but sessions were short.

\- After Christmas, I had free time to meditate. Almost immediately channeled something that provided nine pages of content on humans and aliens. Transcript below.

\----------------------------------

Longer version.

Interesting things started happening in mid-November. In this order:

**--)** Around November 18 (I didn't write down the exact date), I was extra tired and decided to take a nap before work. Almost immediately upon getting comfortable, the loud roar and vibrations that happen before astral projection started. This isn't unusual for me. I've trained myself not to resist (though I find this unpleasant) and usually, it happens in the same way -- I end up floating with my face a few inches under the ugly popcorn ceiling in my bedroom, where I let myself fall asleep and wake up in my body like usual.

During this nap, I felt myself separate and elevate, the noise and vibrations were replaced by the stillness of being out of the body, and I felt myself stop moving. I assumed I was under the ceiling and opened my eyes expecting to see a face full of popcorn ceiling. Instead, I was surrounded by black with what appeared to be an array of bright white lights like LEDs arranged in a long rectangular grid above me. It was impossible to tell how far away the lights were.

This has never happened to be me before, ever, that I can remember. I've never seen anything like it. I didn't feel afraid, but I was very confused. I looked at the lights for a bit and then looked around. When I was looking down the left side of the light array, I noticed movement on the other side and looked back to see a scowling gray alien face had appeared and was staring at me. This is the first time, to my memory, that I have ever seen one of these beings.

It looked like the drawings, but its cranium was a bit wider at the top and it looked kind of old with creases and a weathered look to its face. It had large black eyes and stared at me without moving. I stared at it. I didn't feel afraid -- I didn't feel anything. But I was surprised in the sense of not expecting this. I didn't look away because I didn't know what was happening. It just stared at me. Then a very clear and strong idea entered my mind: ""I don't want to see this. I will go to sleep now."" I repeated this to myself as the exact same thought played in my head again.

I closed my eyes and the next thing I knew, I was on my bed shortly before my alarm was set to go off. Nothing was unusual or out of place and I physically felt fine. I never at any point felt like I had been asleep.

Here is a crude sketch I did to show what I saw while out of body: [https://ibb.co/Y3TKwqF](https://ibb.co/Y3TKwqF)

\---------------------------

**--)** Thursday, November 21, 2019, was normal as far as I can tell. But something strange happened. I woke up on Thursday like normal, got dressed, showered, got my coffee, went to work, settled into my desk, and then checked the calendar to see what was scheduled and was stunned to discover that it was actually Friday.

Now, let me explain. Every so often in the past I've lost track of the days in my mind for a moment and would be like, ""Oh, haha, right it's Tuesday, duh, I had a brain fart."" I'm sure we've all experienced this at some point.

This lost Thursday was NOT like that. I cannot even explain how I felt, it was like the floor had been ripped out from under me. This wasn't momentarily losing track of the day -- I had a complete sense of time and every cell in my body believed it was Thursday morning. The discombobulated feeling from the actual day not matching the day my body felt it should be made me feel sick. I got sheets of goosebumps from it. My memories from Thursday were still there (I checked the previous day's text messages and remembered sending them), but it was like an entire day-sized chunk of time itself had been perfectly erased from not just my brain, but also my body.

I convinced myself that I must have mistakenly thought it was Thursday, even though I didn't believe it. But every time during that day when I glanced at the calendar, I'd get nauseous and have goosebumps all over again. It took around 48 hours for the disoriented, discombobulated feeling to go away and for my body clock to feel like it was synced back with the right time again. It was such a bizarre, uncomfortable feeling.

\- The next Thursday after this was Thanksgiving in the US. I stayed with relatives and had already forgotten about the missing Thursday from last week. Nothing weird happened. I returned home on Sunday and everything was normal. I wasn't even thinking about the stuff from the week before.

\- On Thursday, December 5, 2019, it happened again. I woke up, went about my normal routine knowing it was Thursday, thinking about what I was going to do on Friday night, only to fire up my work calendar and see that it was already Friday. When this happened, I basically lost my shit. I almost threw up. Not even from fear, but from the overwhelming sense of reality itself fracturing and the complete incongruity between my internal sense of time and it being out of sync with actual time. The fact that it happened on the same day of the week but conveniently skipped the holiday felt almost like being teased.

\-----------------------------------

Over the next ten or so days following this experience, I found myself randomly linking with some other being or intelligence in what was essentially channeling. This is something that used to happen to me when I was young but hadn't happened to any substantial degree for many years. It was as if my body had some internal battery that had been recharged and I was fully back online for the first time in a long time.

The presence never felt threatening at all, but I was busy with the holidays and work and didn't have the inclination to sit down and entertain the presence for a proper session. I did, however, at times ask it some questions before bed and I got some responses. Here are some things I asked that you guys may be interested in:

**Question**: How many intelligent species exist in our galaxy that have equal to or greater than intelligence compared to humans?

**Answer**: 7,248,492

Note: When it said that, I thought to myself, ""Hah! That's obviously bullshit, come on now, that's an astronomical number."" Until I Googled how many planets are located in the Milky Way. Estimation: 100 billion to 400 billion. I can't even wrap my head around that number, it's so big. From what I read, it is estimated there are tens of billions of planets that may be able to support life. Seven million is a minuscule percentage of tens of billions and practically nothing compared to hundreds of billions. So I guess the number isn't so comically massive after all. Though I still take it with a huge grain of salt.

**Question:** How many intelligent species have visited Earth, including ones that are no longer here and ones that may still be here?

**Answer:** 84.

**Question:** Why don't they just announce themselves and stop with the obfuscation?

**Answer:** People cannot know. They will be afraid. Too hard for them to understand.

I had asked some other questions verbally that I didn't bother to write down, but I did write the answers since I was funneling these questions into automatic writing that night. One question I didn't write down but can remember was:

**Question:** Is there anything in my body right now that could be considered an implant? And if so, where?

**Written Answer:** Yes. Thigh. Left. Upper. Not much upper. Kind of deep.

**Question:** What does it do?

**Answer:** Monitors.

**Question:** Is it somewhere I can feel it and dig it out?

**Answer:** No.

I also asked it if there was an energy breathing pattern I could do that would benefit my body (I accidentally discovered pulling energy into my body a few months ago and am slightly obsessed with figuring out new patterns right now), and it gave me one. I can write it out if someone is interested but it's off-topic, so I'll avoid it for now.

So, that happened off and on for a while. Fast-forward until after Christmas. I was finally back home in the peace and quiet, was developing a cold, and not in the mood to be around anyone for a while. After working for a few hours that morning, I played some games, then sat down to meditate and within minutes was fully linked with some external being or intelligence that was very talkative. At first, I was automatic writing in a notebook but the info was coming so fast I had to switch to my laptop to type it out.

I shared a transcript of the channeling session elsewhere recently without the wider story attached. Here are PDF and plain text links. It is nine pages long and includes some discussion about other species, humans, and a brief talk about alien abduction. The PDF has the best formatting but will be hard to read if you're on a phone.

https://docdro.id/XzI7669 \[PDF\]

https://pastebin.com/XEZsK7VL \[Plain text\]

That's all at this point. Twice since I have felt what seemed to be an attempt at further communication (whether from the same communicator, I have no idea), but I am traveling for work right now and too busy to try another session. I will return home on Friday and hope to have another fruitful session this weekend.

If you're interested in these channeled messages, you can follow my Reddit account. I plan to post most of the messages directly to my Reddit user page so I don't flood any single subreddit with messages. If I ever get anything super interesting that comes through, though, I'll share it with the wider community.",0

A dream or abduction?,"I'm your average teenager, I never really believed in aliens but believed something else besides us must be out there. Last night I had a dream that was so realistic i'm starting to doubt it was a dream. Typically I have short sexual dreams and then my mind goes blank and I sleep. 

It started by me feeling intoxicated, very cloudy and slow with decisions. I also remember waking up in a super bright room and the light hurting my eyes. I walked into a room with many other humans there sitting on a seat ledge. My mom was there and so was my sister and running coach, I sat next to my mom. It was dead silent and everyone looked very emotionless. There was a red swaying curtain and I lifted it up and looked through windows it was covering. When looking at the windows I became very motion sick and almost threw up. When I woke up this morning I was face down on my pillow and I had blurry vision for a solid 10 minutes. I didn't take a picture in time before it went away but I had a perfectly shaped triangle scratch on my neck and on my arm and a rash on my neck as well.  What's making me feel it wasn't a dream is that I could feel the ground when walking and also smell, I could feel myself sitting down too. I don't know if its my eyes fucking with me since I've been thinking about it a lot but my clothes slightly sway in my closet from time to time. I somewhat jokingly told my parents and they laughed and said i'm crazy, my 9 year old sister said the same thing happend to her but she's probably playing along. Has anything similar happend to you? I'm not gonna tell anyone because everyone will think i'm insane.",0

If any of you know what documentary I'm talking about or would like to help then please help me out. Thank you in advance!",0
"Guys. All due respect. Intense and severe sleep paralysis accounts for many of your abduction stories. Nust trying to be friendly. It is known sleep paralysis can cause experiences just as powerful as this, and the delusions are anything under the sun that come after about the world",0,0
Can Anyone Relate?,"This is a vague yet vivid childhood memory that's always stayed with me but that I don't usually tell people about or if I do brush it off as probably just a dream. Well two different memories actually. I didn't really know anything about aliens when said events occurred between 4 and 5 years old. My story isn't the typical abduction story because I wasnt abducted (that I'm aware of) but ""visited"". I was around 5 years old and the sun was beginning to rise and I woke up and my long blonde hair was spread out over my pillow and there was a hand resting there with my hair kinda laying on top of it, a long gray hand, non human. I did not look up at the being whose hand it belonged to but I felt calm. It was communicating to me telepathically in a way difficult to describe because it wasn't really human language but I knew what it was communicating. I sensed there were more than one of these beings. They communicated that I was one of them and that even if I couldn't see them they would always be watching me and no matter what happened to me they would never let anything get too bad that I couldn't handle it because I had some kind of purpose. Then they went away. I didn't tell anyone about it for a long time but I was never scared of it /brushed it off later in life as probably just a dream. There was another time shortly before this where I was playing in my bedroom and my parents were in the kitchen when I saw what appeared to be a giant frog man humanoid watching me from outside my bedroom window (we lived in a remote rural area). That time I was filled with fear and labeled it as the boogeyman. I ran out to the kitchen crying, telling my parents they had to come to my room bc there was a big frog man outside my window. They laughed at me and told me I was imagining things and continued on with their adult conversations. I anxiously went back to my room and the frog man was gone. Anyone else have any similar experiences? I'm having trouble finding any info on the internet.",0

UFO Abduction is not real,Deal with it. Fall of bed and get a boo boo. Oh no alien abduction. Need attention welcome to r/Abductions,0
Did any of you guys believe in aliens visiting earth before you were abducted?,"What's your backgrounds, where are you from?  I have a lot of doubts about aliens abducting humans though I believe in intelligent life in space.",0
Was I abducted?,"Ok, I've always had this scar on my left wrist that looks like a tiny white tracker. I don't recall how I got it but I've had it since I can remember. I used to watch X Files with my Dad, we would talk about aliens all the time, and for a long time I thought the thought of other beings out in space was cool. Until this past June and last night. 

I'm shaking writing this. My husband is a skeptic and he believes I could of been abducted before. So here it goes: 

Whether I was or wasn't abducted, I've always felt watched at night. Every night. It's usually right before I go to sleep. It feels like I'm being pulled out of my own body right before I go to sleep. I had several nightmares of being kidnapped as a kid then they just stopped. But that fear of being taken has never changed. Lately I've had this pain in my...you know...the place aliens study the most. But the strange thing is this pain started weeks ago. It was before my experience last night. 

Honestly I recall how I felt more than what I saw. I told my husband about 30 minutes ago but he was half asleep so that's why I got on here. 

We went to bed at about 11PM last night and it felt like I was only tossing and turning for a few minutes.  It had been 6 hours. My husband chose to sleep on the couch since he had been snoring and didn't want to keep me awake. Moments after he left the bedroom, we live in a one bedroom apartment so the living room is only a few feet away, I felt like I was pulled out of my body and kept hearing humming sounds. Like a high pitched machine coming on.  I tried to bring myself back by screaming but I could only gasp for air. I did a couple times as loud as I could but my husband didn't hear me. We leave our bedroom door open and he's a light sleeper. 

I've seen these blue and green lights on the outside of a UFO before (back in June of this year). In that first experience I just brushed it off as a dream. Back in my first experience this summer, I found these two little kids in a red pick up truck in the middle of a commuter lot, they had no idea where their parents were so I took it upon myself to drive them to safety. I dropped the kids off at a nearby gas station and told the employee to call 911 to find their parents then I hopped in the truck and got back on the highway.  I was on this highway alone in the middle of the night for what felt like forever, the whole experience was creepy. Then out of nowhere there's a saucer shaped orb coming towards me. It was the ideal picture of what a UFO would look like when it got close. The door opened and the beam was like a rainbow but it was mostly white, and I was sucked up like a vaccum into pitch black darkness. I was immediately back in my body in bed. 

But last night there was light coming from the door instead of pitch black darkness like last time. The beam of light sucking me up was the same rainbow, bright blue/white color. The room I was in was all white, and shimmery like marble. The ceiling, walls, floor...everything. And several feet in front of me were four aliens. One medical table. And they were slowly pulling me towards them, I was floating in the air and being pulled by their power. The weirdest part was hard to describe. I didn't see their faces but their bodies were exactly like the greys description. Tall, grey, long necks, humanoid. It was like they didn't want me to see their faces and when I tried I heard this incredibly loud buzzing like TVs used to do when that freaky white noise channel would come on. Y'all know what I'm talking about. 

Within that sound was what sounded like a crowd. Just hundreds of people. Men, women, children, babies crying. I didn't know what to do. I was paralyzed, I just wanted to go home. I couldn't see it but I knew there was another room behind them, I just had this bad feeling that something terrifying was behind that door. Pitch black darkness with who knows what inside. Then right before I was taken back there, my husband has a coughing fit and it felt like I was sucked back into my body. All I could do was gasp for air before I got out of bed. 

I brought my blanket out, told him what happened, he reassured me I was safe (probably so he could just go back to sleep). But the odd thing is I don't feel safe. I never do. Especially at night after he goes to sleep. Thoughts? Am I crazy or is this really happening? Both times felt real.",0
Finally telling my story.,"I've never shared anything on one of these pages before and actually just discovered Reddit this morning. 
I've had many alien encounters, mostly in dreams but I want to share with you all the most important one I've had. 
Back around February of this year I had a dream. In this dream I ""woke up"" in a room that was all white. I was laying on a bed but there was no padding and it was more like metal. There was also a sink in this room but that was it. Anyways, the whole dream consisted of telepathic communication. While laying down they told me to get up, but I didn't have control of my body. Next thing I know I was standing and the door to this room opened by itself. They told me to follow the line on the floor (which is funny because I had no control and they were doing everything for me). After following the line I find myself standing in a huge open room. There were tables and windows to the left of me. I believe I was on some sort of ship because outside the window it was dark and I could see stars. While standing there I noticed about 6 other people with me. I saw their faces and most of them were men, they were human but I'm not sure if they had any idea what was going on. There was also an observation area above me with double sided glass. There were beings behind it, and that's when I heard ""we are waiting for ""The ___"" I cant remember the name they gave him but it was significant. After waiting for what felt like forever he finally arrived and said ""we have you here so you can help us, each of you individually will know what it will be in time"". After that I woke up with the worst headache of my life. It was awful and I was shaking. But the kicker is a week after this experience I discovered that I'm a medium.",0
Here goes nothing...,"I hope in this community of over 4k members that this story I'm about to share resonates with someone. To start, I have always had sleep paralysis. Off and on my entire life. This was NOT an episode of sleep paralysis. This was a series of very, very REAL experiences. 

The first episode was in the summer of 2016, I think. I remember waking up and seeing a being standing in my doorway. Upon realizing what I was looking at, absolutely all of my senses were disabled. Speech, hearing, eyesight and I was physically paralyzed. The being was able to disable my consciousness too. It was as if ""static"" completely filled my mind. Once my senses and mind were disabled, I was completely paralyzed and it would fade to black. I would awake in the morning, in my bed like wtf was that. I'd suppress it and try to chalk it up as a dream and go on with my day. 

This happened over and over that summer. I'd say at least 4-5 times. In one instance, before the being entered my bedroom, I awoke and was able to see it with my mind walking in my foyer downstairs. Its so hard to explain. Its like you have to experience it to understand it. That summer it was, I guess, ""the greys""-- your typical, small statured, big-eyed extraterrestrial. But one encounter was much different...

I awoke to 4 beings at the end of my bed. 1 male and 3 females. My son and daughter were sleeping with me that night. The females took my children out of the bed and over to the couch across the bedroom. I knew the kids were ok, the females were doting on them and seemed to be very nurturing. These were not greys, but rather multi-dimensional beings. They were light bodies with a blue hue and almost transparent. Once the females were away from the bed with the children, the male being made sexual contact with me. I don't know why but I knew there was a purpose. There was a reason. I wasn't scared and it wasn't frightening. I was in a relaxed, other-worldly state but I knew what was happening. Once he completed, the females said good bye to the children and placed them back in bed with me and we fell back to sleep and they left. I woke up the next morning completely beside myself because I KNEW what happened was very real, very WEIRD and that I could never tell a soul because someone would have me committed. I felt like a LUNATIC. Later that day, riding in the car my son asked me who the ladies were last night. I pretended he did not say that and I can remember my heart starting to beat rapidly and told him nobody and he must have had a silly dream. He was 6 at the time. 

I have since been visited 1-2x's by the greys. And it was the same as it always is with them, disable and paralyze. No recollection in the morning. 

Has anyone else in Reddit-land had a similar experience to either that of the greys or the multi-dimensional beings?",0
Not really sure but i had some weird experiences as a kid,"I wanna preface this by saying that ive always been deathly afriad of aliens, but also fascinated by them. Theyre literally the only thing im terrified of.

When i was way younger, probably around about ages 6-10 i vividly remember feeling nauseous throughout the night, and waking up to my vision almost zooming in and out repeatedly. One of the most vivid memories would be of my alarm clock across the room spinning and moving around. 

I had nosebleeds almost every night this happened, and never found out why. I also would be covered in random bruises (but thats more likely just normal kid things from running around outside and playing, but i figured i might as well add it). 

I also used to sleepwalk often, normally with no memory of it at all. My parents would find me standing at the foot of their bed mumbling gibberish or talking about completely random topics. 

I also used to bang my head against my pillow every night. My parents took me to the doctor for this and he said he never saw anything like it before. 

Finally, ive always been able to tell when something bad is about to happen. Either i get a really bad shiver and a feeling of anxiety comes over me, or i get a nosebleed or both. (Ie: i remember before the mandalay bay shooting i got a really bad nosebleed out of nowhere)

Anyone have any ideas?

Vivid recurring childhood dream I still recall perfectly today.,"When I was a kid I used to have this recurring dream that to this day still terrifies me and fascinates me. It’s a big hard to explain and it was even harder to explain then but the images have never left my mind. I used to try to tell my dad about them but I never seemed to know how to describe it. These dreams would usually start while I was awake lying in bed awake, over top my reality like images playing, but once the dream was over I would wake up in bed as if I had been sleeping. Sometimes it would start the middle of another dream while I was fast asleep other times before I even fell asleep. In fact I have had trouble sleeping my entire life because I used to be afraid to fall asleep in case the dreams came back. Sometimes they happened anyway. It would usually happen suddenly and violently I would be almost snatched either out of reality or out of the dream I was having. Usually if I was dreaming it would happen with a collision. One time it started as I was dreaming about a brick wall, I was looking at it and there was a potted flower on a stool. I turned around and saw two headlights and a screeching noise and then the truck would collide with the wall and everything would turn white. One time I was dreaming I was at a pool party and when I hit the water with a loud collision I would wake up in this same white room. It wasn’t a room per se... I was in whiteness. A big white nothing. There would be voices but I could never understand them. But I knew they were talking about me. Deciding that to do with me. After thinking it over the years I almost assume it was a sort of psychic language perhaps. Something I couldn’t comprehend because I don’t remember the voices just that I knew they were talking about me. They would sometimes ask me questions and I would answer. Sometimes they would try to push me into tiny spaces and I would scream at them that I didn’t fit. Sometimes they would try to roll me out flat like I was a shirt going through an old fashioned ringer. I remember there would be two massive rolling pin like wheels and I would be pushed into them. When I say pushed, there was no one actually pushing me.. I was floating in whiteness... the rolling wheels were white the walls were white and these... people or whatever they were would be talking somewhere in the whiteness... as if they were so big I couldn’t even see them... as if they were also dressed in white and shining so bright I couldn’t make them out from the rest of the room. I remember feeling flattened and then stretched out and then really big and really small over and over again... this sensation of being really big and really small. Like I was being tested for how flexible I was. I really hated that part of the dream it terrified me and I remember protesting the whole time trying to tell them I couldn’t be rolled flat or fit into a tiny space but they still tried. I remember there was a woman though.. I don’t remember what she looked like but she was a motherly figure, like my mom and she would comfort me. I would wake up and be terrified of this woman and what had just happened to me and scream for my parents. This happened so regularly. It was the same, every single time it was the same. There were periods in my childhood where this would happen to me every night and I was unable to sleep because I knew they would come at night. I know this sounds like an abduction but I’m curious to know if there are any other possible explanations. Why does this still haunt me to this day and still so vividly? Why was it the same dream over and over again? I think it actually stopped happening to me sometime around puberty but that was around 10-11 and by then I was already staying up nightly to 3am at least unable to sleep. Sometimes even till the sun came up. Even now I am posting at almost 7am because I don’t sleep at night. I remember this dream often coming to me while I was awake, terrified and waiting and then the woman would show up and I would immediately fall asleep and be in the dream. If I was quick I would scream for my dad to come help me. To this day he tells me I used to talk about a woman in my room. And for those who are wondering, yes I have sleep paralysis, all the time. It sucks. I hate it. It happens when I’m wide awake too. I also have a rare genetic disease called Osteogenesis Imperfecta (type 1) inherited from my dad. Also, my blood type is AB-. My mom says neither she nor my dad have that blood type so idk where it came from. My mom is a positive not sure about my dad.",0
Waking up with weird marks on my body for years. (PHOTOS),"About 4 years ago I tried posting this in r/Aliens without any response or information so I forgot about this and let it go, that is until more recent developments. The 1st picture is when I lived in California. I woke up with a square shaped sub-dermal rash on the back of my arm, it didn't hurt, it didn't itch. It lasted about a week. I pulled on it at an angle to get a photo so it is skewed but it was almost a perfect square. Also I looked around my bed for anything that might have that shape and maybe indented on me and found nothing. The 2nd and 3rd photo is in a hotel middle of nowhere Montana October or so of this year. I woke up at around 4AM with a headache and a small triangular cut in my ear. Happened again last month in Minnesota but I woke up at 2AM from a weird sound and my ear had another triangular cut 4th and 5th photo but it was bleeding. I spoke to my mother and she told me my ears used to bleed all the time when I was a child and she figured I was scratching the inside in my sleep, which is a possibility I guess, its just that all of these are geometric shapes which is weird from three separate occasions. I also have weird dreams and some weird occurrences if this gets any traction or if there is some interest I can go into some of those. Let me know what you think. 

TL;DR Been waking up with weird marks on my body and want to know whats going on.

I got abducted by the greys,Last month I was abducted by the greys assuming I am not just making this up I have a few questions as to what they might have done to me. After I got abducted many changes happened to my body. First thing I noticed was my ass and balls hurt (semen extraction?) like hell and my stomach was in severe pain also. So obviously I may have gotten an anal probe of some sort which is pretty cliche for an abduction but what I cannot find any reports online about abduction is the severe pain I got in my teeth and gums I could barely eat for a few days and my gums were degrading I could just rub my tongue on the inside of my cheek and skin would fall off any idea as to what they might have done to me and why? I know there will be lots of skepticism as to whether or not I am just making this up and I wouldn't blame you but just assuming I am telling the truth what would you think they did to me?,0
Not sure what happened one night...?,"So a couple of years ago I decided to air bnb a cabin up in Humboldt county and get away for a few days with my dog. Cool spot for sure. Small cabin on someones property, not far from the main house but plenty of privacy and my own hot tub. Decided to go out one night to arcata and meet some people. Stuck around at a taproom, had 2 beers and left back to my cabin. I had also brought an eighth of mushrooms with me and decided it was a good time to break those out and blend them into a smoothie once i returned around midnight. Enjoyed the smoothie, turned on my bluetooth speaker, some tunes and started to roll up some weed as I began to feel the onset of my trip. I remember everything starting to look bubbly and colorful, the walls were breathing and smashing pumpkins was playing on the speaker. My next memory is waking up at 7:30am, it was quiet, I was fully clothed with my blankets over me laying in the same spot I last remembered hanging out. A whole mushroom trip and no memory of anything at all? I had to have been active because how else would I have grabbed the blankets that I had left in the bedroom downstairs and brought them back up to the den and couch upstairs? If you've ever done mushrooms you would know that one just can't easily fall asleep especially with the dose I took. This is where the story gets weirder... 
After wondering what had happened after waking up I noticed that my leg hair on my ankle that covers a small tattoo of a flying saucer was completely missing. No signs of shaving or irritation, the hair was just completely missing over the tattoo(it took a while for the hair to start growing again). What exactly happened that night?",0
Keep dreaming of Aliens trying to take me away... What does it mean?,"
I've had a couple of dreams lately of aliens (greys) coming into my parents house and me running away from them. They always arrive at the garden (which is in front of the house) and I run towards the back to escape them.
Last night I dreamed that I was at the third floor and started seeing blueish white lights, like very strong flashlights and me getting very scared, knowing who they are and running away towards the back of the house. I woke up quite altered. The thing is I'm in Asia at the moment and my parents house is in Mexico so I'm quite far in terms of distance and time difference. The previous dreams have happened while in Mexico. 
Another dream I had was also at my parents house and seeing tall greys arrive at the garden and me trying to run away from them towards the back of the house.
Another dream I had was also them coming and me not wanting to go with them and then, they dressed as monks or something trying to lure me away with them.
What do you guys think this means? Are they trying to contact me? Is this a predictive dream? Any similar experiences?

Dreaming of meeting a Pleiadian man?,"Idk whether to call this an abduction, dream, astral projection, dream invasion, or what, but here it goes:

It was nighttime and for some reason I was out in the woods, surrounded by pine trees and the stars were shining. I was looking strait, then around, and when I looked strait again the man was there a few feet in front of me, it seemed almost like he had a glowing yellowish-white ring outlining him; he was standing strait, and if I recall correctly, he was holding his hands down in front of his stomach with his fingers and thumbs touching tip-to-tip while aimed down.

He was a tall, physically fit white man, with blue eyes and long blonde hair a few inches past his shoulders, it was combed back out of his face and behind his shoulder, it was strait but also a little wavy towards the ends (I think; It's been a while since the dream so I don't exactly remember), and he had no facial hair. His wardrobe consisted of a long white thaub-like outfit with a dark redish-purple sash wrapped around his left shoulder, I also think he may have been wearing brown sandals... So yeah, he was basically dressed like Jesus.

Anyway, I was a bit surprised to see him there and didn't know what to do so i just stood there a bit wide-eyed and expressionless, and we just looked at each for a moment without saying anything before he gestured with his left hand, swinging it gently away from his body towards the woods on the left. I followed the motion and saw a large rock formation sticking out of the ground with a medieval planked wood door on the front, which was shut.

I looked back at him for a moment and he slightly nodded at me, then back at the door, and just as I was about to walk towards it I woke up.

Idk, I've always had this natural interest and attraction to Pleiadian-looking men since i was very young and knew nothing about the Pleiadians; Long blonde hair, fair skin, blue eyes, no facial hair, and well-built; I still don't know if it's just a natural interest or a connection to Pleiadians from some time before this life that has me beckoning to that type. Not to mention that years later I learned the Pleiadian star system is actually inside my astrological zodiac sign; Taurus (the bull).

&#x200B;

I know this could just be a simple dream from watching TV or looking into alien stuff too much on the internet, idk. I just thought I should share.

1973 Pascagoula UFO Encounter/Abduction (Audio Clip),"This clip is from the secret tape that convinced the police that Calvin Parker and Charlie Hickson truly believed they were abducted by aliens. (4min, 30sec)

*The police at the time would interdigitate people in separate rooms, then put them in a common room and record the audio, most of the time this recording would reveal the truth, they would hear them talking about what they said and corroborating their fabricated story, in this case.. not at all!*

Possible abduction by the Short greys remembered as a 'dream' (Long/detailed),"Short Greys: I quickly sat up, waking from a sleep, in a huff, I could feel my heart heart gently pounding and was staring in confusion at the ground trying to collect myself. Staring in the direction I was, and out of my peripheral, I could see I was not at home, yet I wasn't scared of that fact; Aside from waking up in a panic, I was completely calm about everything else that was going on around me.

I was in a wide metal room that had dim lighting except for small sources of light on certain things. The walls didn't have sharp corners, but rather sloped corners with random metal 'bubbles' occasionally sticking out near the ceiling and floor, towards the ground it almost looked like there was black rubber lining the walls, and I could see a few chair-like tables lined up (I think) 3 horizontal and 4 vertical, with 2 extra on the far left that run perpendicular to the parallel rows. I want to say it was some form of a 'alien' hospital or testing area.

The chair-tables were positioned on top of a thin metal table that sat on top of a single metal pole sticking out of the ground with 1 inch-thickish metal arms connected and sticking a out on the sides near the top of the table; And small individual bendable lights on the arm of each chair stuck up and were turned on, lighting up a small area. They were very flat and simple in design. If I recall correctly, some chairs had 3 flat sections to them that looked like they could bend; These were black-grey, if I remember right, and others were slightly sloped with many very slightly cushioned ridges, but didn't look like they could bend; I believe the chair colors were a beige/yellow/orange in color.

As I looked around my surroundings I noticed my chair. I was positioned on the 3rd and last table in the 1st column on the left side. My chair was much different than all the others; It had a full metal underside that took up the length and width of the chair; Even a bit past in some areas; the chunky metal connected and crawled up the wall behind me and then stuck out a longer piece of metal that was positioned above me; There was a small dim light shinning down on me with something bigger positioned on top. My chair was beige, more sloped, and had multiple more cushioned ridges, and had large bubbled side bars connected to it; I assume to keep me in one position and from rolling out. The severity of the slope made it seem like I was sitting and laying down at the same; Sitting up made my knees closer to my chest. I recall I was fully clothed, but don't exactly remember what i was wearing, I'm pretty sure it was the clothes I had went to sleep in; A black T-shirt and pajama pants.

The entire room was empty except for 6 small beings and 2 unconscious humans on the 2 extra tables on the left side of me. I noticed that the being were abnormally thin, small, and even in the dim room I could tell they were very pale, and knew they had to be the Greys, yet I still wasn't scared. I think it may have been a young guy (judging from the lack of a chest), I couldn't see his face due to the position the chair had me sitting. I recall him being nude, but I think he may have some sort of white paper towel covering his genitals. I could see small tubes sticking out of him and a bright light directly over him that was connected to the ceiling.

It didn't look like they being were trying to be cruel or harmful, but rather like they were trying to perform some sort of delicate operation. I couldn't get a good look at the tools they were using due them blocking my view with their bodies while working and staying out of the light when not working, but their outlines were small, some looked like they may have been scalpels and scissor forceps.

One being was doing the surgery while 3 were doing other occasional minor-looking tasks and handing the 'doctor' the surgical tools; All without talking; Seemingly just knowing what to do and when. The other 2 beings were checking on another body in front of that one.

The ceiling light on this person was off and I couldn't tell if they were male or female. they were hooked up to a machine with different colored lights (green, red, yellow, and blue) and I could still tell there were small tubes coming out of them, I could also tell they were fully clothed; I just couldn't tell exactly what they were wearing. One being was checking the machine while the other was watching over the person.

Thinking about it, they may have just finished performing surgery on both me and this person since we had our clothes on; But mine may have been over a bit longer as I don't recall being hooked up to anything or having any tubes sticking out of me. My chair also seemed more like a comforter; Making sure I relax after operation, while the other person was still on one of the medical chair-tables possibly still getting their vitals checked.

As I saw this all going on the being who was watching over the 2nd body heard me breathing hard and immediately turned and looked at me, noticing I had awaken they proceeded to quickly walk over. When they got to me they put a hand on my right shoulder (I don't recall how many fingers they had) and gently pushed me back into the chair and instead of fighting it I followed their instructions. They then proceeded to get a sort of oxygen mask-looking device from on top of the light above me and put it on my face; The device had a strip of black rubber-like material around the frame of the clear mask that covered my nose and mouth which was connected to my light by a black tube.

As soon as they put the mask on me I immediately blacked out and woke up in my room in, what felt like, a second later.

The entire 'dream' happened in the course of what seemed like 30 seconds.

\- Some extra things I noticed about the Greys:

\*They didn't have any sexual organs where their genitals would be; Instead it kind of looked like maybe a circle, slit, raw or something; I really didn't know what it was.

\* Distinction between genders could not be made.

\*No nipples.

\*large head and eyes, small thin body, short (about 4-5ft tall).

\* Their eyes weren't completely black, but rather their irises were extremely dark - almost black like their pupils.

Im sorry it's a somewhat large range of time but my memory is hazy as to the exact year when my experience occurred and im wondering if it was just an extremely vivid dream that I only remember because it was traumatized me as a child (I was between 5-7 years old but for some reason, it's the most vivid memory I have of those years in my life)",0

It was the middle of the night and I was taking my dog to the bathroom in front of my house. I lived in a dead end street surrounded by woods. I was waiting and I look up and about fifty feet above my head there was a very large metallic green ship flying very slowly making no sounds. The ship was shaped in a right triangle and there where lights underneath. I’m unsure how long I was there. It felt like minutes and before I even saw if it left I yelled for my dog and ran inside.

Again I don’t know if I had time loss. When I went inside to share my experience everyone was asleep.",0

"My Mums Alien Abduction in 1988 - Melbourne, Australia","During spring/summer 1988 when my Mum was 16 she recalls a night where she believes she was abducted by extra terrestrials.

At approximately 10:00 PM on a spring/summer night of 1988 my Mum walked her then-boyfriend to a bus stop down her street which was only a 2-3 minute walk from her house. Her boyfriend lived about 20km away and to get home he had to catch a bus to the train station, catch a train to then switch train lines where he would then switch train lines again at a further station and walk the rest of the distance which would take approximately 70-90 minutes. My Mum recalls saying goodbye and watching him leave on the bus. She then walked back home and when she arrived home the phone was ringing and when she answered it, it was her boyfriend. At first she did not believe it was him and then she asked if he was calling from a pay phone at the train station. He explained to her that he was calling from his home phone (mobile phones did not exist back then). In denial my Mum hung up and dialled his home phone to see if he would pick up, and he did. This left my Mum feeling startled and her boyfriend confused. At the time she threw around the idea of it being some sort of abduction but never investigated further.

However, a couple years ago when my Mum first told me this we did some research and found this UFO report:

*16.09.88 BALLARAT, VIC 2005hrs (NL)*

*AX 1988-001*

*Looking south-westwards towards a distant storm, two men noticed a white, spherical light pulsating on and off, and moving erratically in step-like motions. The noiseless object quickly moved in a north-easterly direction until it was lost from sight, after about five minutes.*

During the spring of 1988 a UFO was spotted around 8PM in a town about 135 km away from where my Mum was living. If on the same night the UFO would have had no problems getting its way to the city (where my Mum lived) in 2 hours (10:00 PM). Even if it was not this exact night there were still sightings around the same time as these events occurred.

We also searched up symptoms of alien abduction and found:

* Reports of missing time
* Celtic/Native American DNA
* Disruption to radio signal when close

These are just a few symptoms that are common in people who claim to have been abducted which are also true of my Mum. The most interesting part about this though is that after reading this we instantly made the connection to the fact that there is a radio in our house that whenever my Mum stands nearby to it becomes static and loses signal. My Mum also reported losing her sense of time (as stated when she arrived home to realise her boyfriend got home at the same time). My Mum is also Native American with some celtic ancestroy, I read that apparently extra-terrestrials target individuals of mixed celtic and native descent... not sure why? anybody know?

Growing up I also realised that my Mum has a lot of 'psychic' tendencies where she has fortold events and also connect with spirits. The latter is especially true as she lost a close friend of hers to suicide and she often tells me how she dreams of her friends children and then those things she dreams of become a reality.

What are peoples thoughts on this? Anybody else from Melbourne, Australia experience anything similar from the same time?

It all started when I was young..,"When I was a kid alot of weird stuff would happen to me. I can remember my childhood mainly by these weird moments of me wondering about the things happening to me, even though I was just a small child..but it got weirder as I got older.

I was about 15 or 16 years old now, I became interested in watching the sky at night because I wanted to see shooting stars. I lived in a ranch and the view of the sky was pretty nice, not super clear but you can see more stars out there. I ended up seeing very few of them from time to time, but I noticed the white light flashes some nights. And for some reason after a while I knew when to go outside to see them, and somehow I knew when to go outside. I was good at it I even showed my sister because she would make fun of me, but after i showed her she was amazed. Summer came and my sister left for vacation for 2 months to my grandparents so i would sleep alone in my our room. We had these old glow in the dark stars glued to the cealing  but they were quite old, old enough not to really  glow anymore. Years old.

One night I remember waking up to the feeling of weightlessness,  like if I was floating,...I didnt know I was actually waking up to this, I felt it more dream like. And then..I started to feel my bed. As I opened my eyes I suddenly felt as I was was being place on my bed. I felt my body touch my bed, and I opened my eyes wide. And that's when I realized the stars on my cealing. They were at full glow!! As if they had been under a light, but to be that bright and that old all I can imagine is them being hit by an extremely bright light....for hours!!  And the brightest glow on the dark stars were above me. I remember realizing that and being like wtf!! But then I guess I passed out real quick because I remember waking up again but this time it was day. And when I had woken up to the bright stars it was still dark..
 
And that was only the beginning to the strange things that were to happen next.",0
Dont Remeber Abduction.,"Me and my daughter were home alone, we went to bed like any normal night. i woke up and grabbed some water and i have a window above the sink, and i live in a small town with a population of 100 in northern Canada. behind the bushes i saw greyish figures with eyes that look like cats eyes at night. from there i went to the back door to double check if it was locked, from there something happened, i blacked out but i faintly remember it was busted down. me and my daughter woke up in bed stiff and above the covers. i woke up like i was in dream but wasn't, not that much time passed, but i woke up frightened and paranoid. i went back to the window and i checked the back door everything was normal, but what wasn't was that that me and my daughter were in bed like that and i had a small bump on my leg that disappeared the next day. sounds weird but i cant explain what happened but that we were abducted. it wasn't the first time UFOs were sighted in my hometown. i would like to hear if anyone else has had the same experience.",0

I keep seeing it in my dreams,"This place I can't stop seeing in my dreams for as long as I can remember.  I believe myself to be a lifelong abductee.  I suspect they may have had my consciousness  there and it became seared in my mind.  It is not a good place.

The place is like a giant city but feels like it's all under one roof.  No roads or cars- carpeted hallways packed with rooms.  A maze- countless rooms, hallways, stairwells.  Long hallways of offices, swimming pools, churches, gyms, clinics, amphitheatre rooms (I see stage dramas going on), stairways, catwalks, lots of round rooms, exercise classes, dentistry, nursery and school rooms that eventually stop abruptly at the end of the hall and becomes a vast and busy laboratory/ medical complex.  People of all ages everywhere, hurrying to and fro- harsh, serious people, humorless, cold, unwelcoming.  

Usually I will find myself wandering around the place, trying to figure out its' secrets, what happens behind all those doors, it's so secretive, they won't let me see.  I spend all my time aimlessly wandering because I am not included as one of the people who belong to this place.  I am apparently only supposed to be in the laboratory but I'm too scared of being in that place.  I think of Auschwitz.

The laboratory-hospital is immense, like a city.  It's mazelike halls seem endless.  I see high tech equipment everywhere, wires,  pipes, computers on carts, beds and rooms and curtains, men and women in lab coats and gloves.  It looks like a hospital but more colorful- tangles of blue and orange wires everywhere.  I see bodies on white carts all over the place and medical instruments and I feel death and suffering in the air.  I sneak around, I try not to be seen by the lab workers.  Sometimes I am taken and operated on, sometimes I am allowed to wander.

I am drawn to hallways full of strange offices.  Fascinated, I cannot read the colorful words on the doors that explain what all the different offices are used for.  I know intuitively I am not supposed to be seeing this, and that's why I'm drawn to it, I need to know what this place is.  I do not like this place at all.  I do not like the people.  I especially do not like the lab.  I know if I am seen in these office hallways I will be in trouble, so I sneak.  But without being able to open the doors or understand the words on them, I can't find the answers to my questions.  Strange things go on here for sure, things that I feel in my bones are very wrong.  

Could I be describing the inside of a UFO?",0
Probable alien message sent through me. I need probable explanations or similar stories.,"Well this is my first post ever, and as weird it may sound I think I served as a tool to send a messages to someone or something. 

This happened just last night and it was crazy realist. 

I usually stay up until late night so last night wasn’t too different from other nights, and also I have to clarify that I have experience sleep paralysis several times, so I’m used to that kind of experiences where is impossible to move at all or it is very difficult almost like if I was trying to swim upstream or if like gravity was too much to overpower and move. So with that explained, I’ll proceed to describe my experience as detailed as I remember.

As I said, I usually stay up until late night so last night was one of those days that I just didn’t go to my bedroom and lay down in the sofa, I like to sleep there because is very comfortable so nothing special or weird in particular, so I was practicing some French and let a video playing on my cellphone but felt asleep while listening to it, then when I realized I left the video playing I opened my eyes, paused it, locked it and put it aside and closed my eyes falling back again to my empty black dreams (cause I don’t have dreams very often).

So, after that I opened my eyes with a high pitch noise in my ears, almost like if a was listening to an old tv’s static at max volume, I immediately knew something was off so I tried to move but I couldn’t, I just moved my head a little bit to look around, and I don’t know how but all the sudden I listened a voice in my head and I quote “We need to send a message through you, yes or no?” and at the moment I was like wtf!! it was like if a was just listening to my own thoughts, so in my mind I ask back “do I have to decide now?” and the damn pitch in my ears became even louder and I thought (not trying to be funny at all, I really said this in my mind) “shit, I think that’s a YES” after that I stayed like 2 or 3 secs just hearing the now super high pitch sound and thinking about it, so I said (obviously in my mind) “Yes” and I felt like if I was passing out, cause saying I was falling asleep is way too different, and while my eyes were closing I saw a fucking alien, a grey one to be specific, I saw it cristal clear, it opened it’s mouth while I was getting closer to it, so when I went into his mouth (felt like falling into a hole) I started hearing like if a radio have been turned on and part of the “message” that I remember it said something like “you know that we are really here” after that I just felt asleep and the next thing I heard was like if there were people in my garage talking very softly or murmuring and heard like if someone was about to open the door, and then all the sudden the voices faded and heard just birds chirping so I woke up at 6 am, but I swear it felt like not more than a minute, also when I felt paralyzed and I opened my eyes it was dark, I could see the pitch black night even though I didn’t know what time it was I knew it was late night cause when I laid down in the sofa was almost 3 am.

Another weird thing, as I’m writing this, two flies are flying around my head (thing that is weird cause the house was totally closed last night), and a damn spider just walked beside me out of nowhere not something weird but just giving details. 

Other thing to add is that when I woke up I felt like if a was in a different position, and my crocs were too perfect aligned beside the sofa almost as if I had put them on and went for a walk or something.

I know is a lot to read but I wanted to give as much details as I could so I would like to hear your opinion I don’t know what think or what to believe.",0

Was this real? I’ve never forgotten it,"Ok so I’ve always been a believer. I’ve seen ufos a few times in my life but I wouldn’t say I’ve ever been abducted or anything. At least not that I can remember. This experience is a little different but it seemed so real to me when it happened that I have never forgotten it and the only conclusion I can come to is that for a split second, when everything was quiet and I was relaxing, I saw something in my mind that scared the fucking shit out of me. A flash image. Like reality had pulled the curtain back and I was seeing something behind it that perhaps I wasn’t supposed to see. That’s how it felt anyway. 
Years ago when I worked the dinner shift at a restaurant I was laying down in my room in the middle of the day. Just laying on the bed. My eyes were closed but I definitely wasn’t asleep. I was the only one home so the place was quiet. I wasn’t thinking of anything in particular, just laying there. Then it happened. Bam. For a split second an image flashed in my mind, clear as day. It was of a dimly lit space like a cave or something with all these membranous pods sort of growing out of the wall in a row. They were kind of glowing, or giving of an orange red type of light. I can’t really explain it but it was like the only light in this room or cave was coming from these pods. They were person sized I would say, like a grown human could crouch inside one. There was a humanoid figure standing over one off these pods like he was examining it closely. I saw his face and it was almost like his features were melted or something. Or like they hadn’t properly developed. He was covered in grease or something like Vaseline. He didn’t look human but he was humanoid. Also, my immediate thought was that he was male and also that these pods housed either human people or aliens. It was over in a second and I sat up thinking ‘what the fuck was that?!’ It was so clear and so real looking. Nothing happened after that and I went about my daily life with no bother but I’ve never forgotten it. I can still see it as clear as the day it happened. Did I imagine it? Has anyone here ever had a similar experience? I’m looking for possible explanations but also just wanting to share my experience with people who are interested.",0

Second Guessing a Childhood Experience...Was it and Alien Encounter?,"I work a pretty easy going office job and I consistently listen to podcasts while I do my work.That being said I've always had an interest in the paranormal and unexplained, so that's typically what I listen too.I was listening to a interview by Astonishing Legends with Terry Lovelace about the things he encountered and what he experienced from a camping trip in Devil's Den back in the 70s.To sum it up he touched on what happened to him and a couple of things stood out to me. It reminded me of something that happened to me as I kid that I always chalked up to sleep paralysis, but now it has me second guessing myself.

I must have been in about the 3rd or 4th grade. At the time we lived kind of on the edge of a bunch of farm land and woods. Our back yard opened up to our neighbors whom owned acres upon acres of land. And to the left of that was just endless farm land and forest. We lived a few miles away from a really popular and huge dairy farm, but we were also a mile or two out from a main road that leads into town. I guess the point I'm getting at is we were kind of secluded but not completely isolated. The Midwest is like that at times I guess.

My room at the time was in the basement, and the stairs that led down to it was right in front of our backdoor. I slept with my bed right in front of my bedroom door as well. It was summer break and after finally decided I was tired I went to lay down in bed. My memories goes in and out at that point and there's missing spots in between because I think as soon as I laid down I just blacked right out.

I remember I just woke right up after passing out, and I'm not sure how much time passed between these two point in time. But I immediately looked at the foot of my bed and the door to my room is wide open and theres this blinding light outside my room. I remember seeing this figure right in the door way to my room. I couldn't make out any distinct features because of the light coming from behind it. All I got was an outline and the shape of how it looked. It must have been not that much shorter than me as I was a kid at the time. Probably around 4ft I think. It had a huge bulbous head and a tiny body. In retrospect it was shaped like a Grey but I don't know if that's a cliché to say.

I just remember this utmost primal sense of fear, and I couldn't move. I've never experienced that level of horror before, and I haven't felt that feeling sense. I was laying on my back in my bed and all I could do was stare at it. I was trying to scream but nothing could come out of my lungs and I couldn't get up to run out or anything, I was completely paralyzed to that spot.

I blacked out again, came to, and it was closer, right at the end of my bed. At that point I tried screaming again and still nothing would come out and yet again I blacked out.

I came to that morning at the opposite side of my room, flopped across this little couch I had.

It's hard to explain it too because there's nothing in between these points of time its just a blank spot.

I tried to explain to my mom but it was just chalked up to sleep walking and a nightmare because I stayed up to late or something to that effect. For a while after that I was horrified to watch any from of alien movie or even just anything in tv that resembled what that thing was shaped like. I would have a full blown panic attack and start to hyperventilate. I've gotten passed that and that doesn't really get to me anymore....However I still to this day cannot sleep with my bed in front of my door or with my door open. I don't even like sleeping near the door, I need to be as far away from it as possible. Even during the day if I'm doing something in a room I need to have the door closed, having it open sends this just massive feeling of discomfort and anxiety, I can't do it.

I've experienced weird things through out all my life but after a while and with growing up I just always chalked it up to sleep paralysis but I'm not so sure anymore?

Can anyone offer any insight? Or at least tell me if I'm crazy or not because trying to explain it or even think about it just makes me feel like I'm nuts.",0
My experiences with abductions as a young child,"Earlier this year, I posted my story on r/aliens but the mods deleted it for some reason. I've decided to share it again because it took me a long time to come to terms with it and it is the unembellished truth. I also want my story out there in case there is another person out there like me, someone else who does not believe in their own abduction until they see the account of another abductee that's identical to their own. In my case it was watching a talk by a man named Jim Sparks, and his recollection of his abductions were practically identical to my story. I've included links to his talk later in my post. 

I have direct memories of only one abduction event, but I am pretty sure I underwent routine abductions up until the age of six or seven. As a very young child, in the 1980s, I used to be taken by the ""Easter Bunny to the North Pole to play with Santa"" every year on Christmas Eve. I was sworn to secrecy about this or else the Easter Bunny said he wouldn't come back. These visits happened every year without fail.

At the ""North Pole,"" we would play together in a two dimensional space and the games we would play were educational in nature but very fun. The experience was more like a projection or video game but I would experience it as real. It's hard to describe. I have no recollection of the specifics outside of brief memories from my last visit.

What I do know is that I *loved* these trips—so much so that before my last trip (at the age of six or seven) I was actually *more excited* for the Easter Bunny to come and take me than I was for Christmas the next day! On this trip I was told I was getting too old for these visits and this would be the last one. I was profoundly sad.

For a couple years after the last Easter Bunny visit, all was quiet. Then, when I was nine years old, the first and only abduction I can clearly recall occurred.

I do not recall the initiating events. By the time I came to I was already being led into my front yard. It was lit up like day. I say ""being led"" but I cannot remember if I was alone or had some sort of escort. I want to say there were entities to either side of me.

My childhood front yard was basically a jungle, but there was one patch of grass that opened into the sky. On more than one occasion I had ""sleepwalked"" here as a child and awoken on this patch of grass in the middle of the night. In the center of the patch of grass was a tiny silver craft, what I would describe as a typical flying saucer only extremely small. The craft was so squat that I probably couldn't even fully stand up inside of it as a nine year old child. I would estimate it was five feet tall and twelve and a half feet across and it hovered about four feet off the ground. I do not recall if there was any sort of landing gear or if it was freely floating.

In front of the craft, walking toward it (and perpendicular to myself) was a classic grey alien. It did not acknowledge me. The creature was childlike in stature, probably a foot shorter than me at nine years old. I, having only seen my first drawing of a grey a few months before this event on a television program, should have been terrified (after viewing that program they'd immediately become fixtures of my nightmares). Despite that, being confronted by one in real life for the first time, I felt perfectly calm and serene.

There was some sort of opening into the craft but I cannot recall if it was a hatch or gangway. I was escorted toward the opening and I remember as I passed the outside of the hull there being Egyptian-looking hieroglyphics inscribed along the lip of the craft.

I black out.

I am seated on a bench in front of a glass screen. Across from me is a grey. Our attention is devoted to one another and we are interfacing through the glass screen device. I am in what I take to be the interior of the craft but the room is far far physically larger than would be possible based on the exterior of the saucer. There are other beings in the room who are engaging in other tasks besides what me and my partner are doing. My attention is wholly devoted to the screen and the task at hand.

The screen is a clear glass screen set on a table, approximately four feet in height, and there is some manner of console (on my side) that I am using to interface with it. I do not recall the grey having anything to use to interface with the device. The task I am devoted to had something to do with communicating between English and the alien language. 

A thought suddenly comes to me: *why am I using this device to translate between English and the alien language when we can just talk using our minds?* I find this thought very funny. I am having fun. Though the precise nature of what is going on eludes me, what I *believe* I am doing is typing in English and having it translated to the alien on the other side. This doesn't make much sense though, because I understand these beings to be able to communicate telepathically. As I use the device, the grey is also using it at times, whether to teach/correct/communicate with me I cannot recall.

I black out again.

The final stage of my abduction is a series of movies projected directly into my mind. I only recall two of them. In the first, I'm in an inlet in a sea in a sort of land before time. The Earth is primordial and pristine. I am moving through the water toward the mouth of the bay and along the coasts on either side is luscious, undespoiled jungle. It is profoundly beautiful.

The second is a snippet of apocalyptic environmental imagery. I see a breakwater or a coastline with a lighthouse situated on it. Waves are surging over the sides and consuming the coast. I am made to understand that humanity is responsible for what is happening here.

The abduction ends.

When I awoke the next day I didn't feel scared or terrified but a sense of calm and inner peace. My mind however felt totally overloaded, like way too much had been put in there to ever remember. I was startled by the fact that I hadn't been afraid of the greys because I'd been having constant nightmares about them as soon as I'd first learned about them a few months prior. I was far more concerned—fixated even—upon remembering the message I had been given. This message which seemed all-consumingly important began to slip through my fingers as soon as I'd awoken. It was only through sheer will that I was able to retain the two snippets I recall here today.

For many years I myself chalked these memories up to sleep disorders or being the fantasies of a child. I left them in my past. Then, a few years ago, I stumbled across a claimed abductee named Jim Sparks, and the parallels to my own experiences were insanely uncanny.

Instead of talking about medical experimentation or sperm extraction or other common abductee claims, he talked about how the aliens would place him in front of a glass screen to learn how to translate the alien alphabet. What's more, he talked about a mass abduction event that would have occurred when I was nine years old in which the abductees were all gathered and shown images of Earth's oceans undespoiled, prior to human damage, and then the deleterious effects of human industry and pollution upon the world. He talks about the specific environmental imagery the abductees were shown [here](https://youtu.be/UibJ-w0ieOM&t=05m06s). He talks about the mass abduction event at length in parts [five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl-YDHLz7ag&t=04m15s) and [six](https://youtu.be/UibJ-w0ieOM) of his talk. I will not vouch for the veracity of anything else he discusses because he does make some very outlandish claims. I am very hesitant of anyone claiming to know the nature or purpose of whatever this insane phenomenon is. I cannot deny though, at least for my own abduction experience, he was right on the money. What he describes is precisely what happened to me.

As someone who had repressed these experiences I just couldn't do it anymore after seeing his talk. It really *did happen* to me. The thought was liberating and terrifying.

I now make my living as an environmental scientist (ha, I know, right?). These memories do not dictate my life. For many years I used my scientific background and demands of proof as ways to dismiss my childhood experiences. But I was being dishonest with myself. I will now say whatever this phenomenon is, I am an experiencer of it.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I'm happy to clarify any details you may be wondering about.",0

Friend and Cousin abducted from bedroom, Not my story but my friend I call josh and his cousin told me that they  were abducted by aliens from his bedroom. This happened back in 1999 on  Long Island. My friend and his cousin were both 13 years old at the time  of the abduction. My friend told me that they were sleeping when a  light shine through his bedroom. Both of them then felt themselves being  lifted into the craft. Once entered the craft they walked down into a  hallway were they might six grey aliens. My friend and his cousin were  told by the aliens that they are going to perform experiments on them  because their race is dying. Both of them agreed to the experiments.  Then the aliens brought them into a medical exam room which had two  tables. Once there the aliens told my friend and his cousin to remove  all their clothing which they did. Once they got naked the aliens told  them to lay down on the table which they did. The aliens made my friend  and cousin to lay spread eagle on the tables which then the aliens  strapped their wrist and legs so they can't move. Once that happened  three alien performed experiments on my friend and others on his cousin.  My friend told  me that the experiments were the same. They took skin  hair blood samples. Also my friend told me that they also took sperm  from and his cousin by putting a suction device or their penises. They  did this by making them getting a erection once they were erect the  aliens put the suction device over their penises to extract sperm from  them. They thanked them for their sperm and dna samples. The aliens told  them that they can get redressed which they did. They were put back in  my friend bedroom. Only my friend told me what happened and no one else. Dose anybody else have similar stories,0
Two new pics and a request,"Alright, two new pics and a request. I'm willing to do hypno regression. I have reached the point of desperation for answers. I feel like I cannot proceed further in life beyond this rut as long as I know too much, but not enough, if that makes sense. I posted [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/Abductions/comments/c8yy0j/my_experiences/) before that explains the major stuff.

Can anyone point me to reputable hypno therapists in this field who are located in the United States? I'm willing to travel anywhere within the US to visit them. Every person I've found who has a reputation in this field seems to no longer be accepting clients. I want someone who isn't going to act like I'm insane and who knows what they're doing -- I don't want someone leading me on or implanting memories because they think it's easy cash.

Here are two new pics:

This is a new clearer image of the scar near my right knee I shared in my last post. I was playing with my camping headlamp and accidentally discovered it has a bright red light setting. The scar is super visible in red light. It measures exactly 1/2-inch long.

[https://ibb.co/Y77TXTZ](https://ibb.co/Y77TXTZ)

Because the headlamp is so insanely bright, it immediately illuminated the scar (which is otherwise nearly invisible) when I turned it at an angle on my leg. So I used it to scan the rest of my leg and other leg for any other scars. That's how I found a second very similar scar in almost the exact same place just under and to the side of my left knee. It is basically impossible to see in natural light from looking down. I have no idea how long it has been there.

[https://ibb.co/X2tk1SF](https://ibb.co/X2tk1SF)

It has the same bowed shaped and dips down like a chunk of skin was scooped out. When I lightly rub it with my finger, I can feel a very hard lump directly in the center that is fixed in place and feels about 1mm wide. It is not painful. Because it is located immediately beneath the skin, I plan to try to remove it myself as soon as I'm able to buy a proper scapel and scissors. I'll report back with what I find.",0
"Sleep paralysis, or visitations?","Sleep paralysis, or visitations?

Firstly, this is my first ever reddit post so bear with me, I’m not very good at “story telling” or explaining things. I’m after some opinions here or possible explanations as to what I experienced as a child, also it’s going to be a long post... so TL;DR I think I’ve been periodically visited by aliens as a child.

It happened to me roughly 5 times, and I still remember them very vividly as if it was only yesterday. My parents always passed them off as dreams, and I myself thought “oh must just be sleep paralysis” as the symptoms match - but not exactly; and I’ve never heard or read of anyone having a similar experience. Even when describing their experiences with sleep paralysis.

The first time it ever happened I was in my new bedroom at the back of the house, my baby brother was just born and his nursery was my old room.
It was a normal night, I’d say around 2-3am here in Australia and I was awoken by the usual sounds of my baby brother crying and mum getting up to make him a bottle. I was around 7 at this time and I thought “I’ll get up out of bed and ask mum to get me a drink”
As soon as I tried to move, the room began to have this dark grey almost green tint wash over it and it became EXTREMELY hard to move, I wasn’t paralysed, it was just like everything was in slow motion. Trying to raise my arm felt like I was trying to pull it up against a strong water current and very, very slowly. I tried to scream, shake my head, make it all stop but it wouldn’t.
Then the next thing I saw was 7, very tall grey figures approaching me and then standing around my bed and looking over me. All the while this is happening I could still hear my mother and my youngest brother going about their business as normal... then nothing. I woke up in the morning.

This continued to happen a few more times throughout my childhood, exactly the same every time, except one time it actually happened when I was standing, just about to leave my bedroom to use the toilet, and as I said earlier my parents passing them off as dreams; but how could they be? I was so aware of what was happening and my surroundings.
From what I’ve read on sleep paralysis/night terrors is that you’re 100% paralysed and you can’t move, and it’s almost 99.9% of the time a demon or other spirit.
Ever since then I’ve been left with a strong interest in extraterrestrials and contact.",0
"Smells, sounds and other questions for abductees.","So almost every story of abductions i've read are mainly focused on what people see and feel. I feel curious about what you experience with your other senses. Can You guys tell us about your encounters?
What smells do You recognize when You are around the beings? Smells on board their ships/medical room? 
How do they feel to the touch? (If they ever grabed You) are they warm? Cold? What's the texture on their skin? 
I know 99% of the time they communicate telepathically, but since i've never experienced that, what do they sound like in your head? Is it like the sound your own voice have in your head? Do they sound high pitched? Different beings sound different from one another?
As someome with a little bit of synesthesia (i savour some specific textures when i touch them) have You had more than one sense triggered at once around them?

Have You met different species? Do all of them smell/sound/feel different from each other? In wich ways?",0
"Called on aliens at night, something weird happened","I called on aliens at sunset to take me away because im tired of being here, then very late at night I heard a loud bang next to my window and some activity. I felt there was someone in my room and suddenly something was dropped from one side of the room to another. I closed my eyes scared and saw a tall reptilian like entity looking at me from my third  eye.....I heard voices in my head that were in another language. Upon researching these words they meant ""slave, submit, bow down"" (I will post them later) and no wonder reptilian entities see humans as slaves to their cause . What's strange it's that I SPECIFIED TO GET THE GOOD GUYS/ALIENS AND ONLY POSITIVE BEINGS OF LIGHT/LOVE but this bad one still came through. WHY?

In the morning I went to check for weird stuff around the evidence and found HUGE FOOTSTEPS all the way fom the hall to my window. There was no distinctive marks on the footsteps and almost looks like the sole of the shoe was completely smooth, anyone seen these before in your abduction stories? I mean it felt like a giant was walking around, reptilians are pretty tall so I guess their feet would be pretty big right? Anyone else had this experience of calling aliens and feeling activity later?",0
The paralysis method [Idea],"I'll start with a quick intro. It started when I saw a couple UFOs, nothing crazy, just orbs that would appear and disappear. There was enough daylight to ascertain these were not man made. At this time I had zero spiritual awareness. Fast forward 6 months.

I am now fully immersed in the whole spiritual realm and have interacted with other entities through the use of shrooms and meditative practices.

I take trips around my state in order to commune with places of power, last night I decided to take a break and stayed at a small motel. 

I got my room and tried to gauge its atmosphere. I then asked my spirit guides to carefully watch over me. As I lied down in bed I received a particularly strong intuition. 

You have to leave, leave this room, get out.

I decided I had already paid and ignored the message. Well, not entirely, I might've been abducted when I was younger so I was familiar with the sleep paralysis procedure. I told myself if it happened again I would pay even more attention to the procedure.

I left the tv on and started drifting into a slumber. In my sleep I'm woken up by the image of the UFOs I'd seen, I heard the words, return. I open my eyes, paralyzed, but I'm extremely calm because I kind of expected this. I see the image again followed by the word return. I then calmly asked, who are you? I got no answer. The paralysis fades and I can move again.

The paralysis effect: It seems the brain goes into a specific pattern of activity in our sleep, when we wake up paralyzed we just become aware of this mental activity. I felt as if the paralysis procedure was a way of locking the brain into in this state. This time rather than letting my thoughts carry me into a panic, I focused on my senses. I heard the tv, but it kept cutting out in a wub wub wub fashion. Like rotating a volume knob back and forth. All sound was like this. I then brought my attention to the peculiarity of being paralyzed so I got myself out of this paralysis by changing my mental state. It's what happens naturally during meditation as we ""stop"" thinking and ascend into a different pattern of brain activity. Just like that I felt like I popped out of the lock and I was capable of moving again.

I've never been able to get out of a sleep paralysis that quickly before. This time I felt comfortable in this state. 

I don't know if this was the precursor to an abduction. Last time I woke up paralyzed, heard a voice in my head, and then I saw the greys. This time I just broke out of paralysis before I could see them. I don't think they were expecting me to be able to ""phase"" out of this mental state lock so quickly. That or it was simply a message. The thing is, when you send a message that is negative to the recipient you usually follow it up with a threat or other motivation. I really have no intention of going back to the place I saw the UFOs. There was a strange honesty to the word though. Almost as if there is knowledge to be gained from going back, curiosity is the motivation, and breaking out of the lock so easily was a lure in order to get me to believe I could fight their paralysis....

I don't get it, if they wanted me there they could just take me there themselves.

During a strong meditation I attempted to remember if I had actually been abducted as a kid or if they had just stopped to do an initial assessment and left without taking me. 

I couldn't really recall anything except for an empty, hazy, white room, and the words, ""This is not real"". This is something I would've told my younger self in order to feel better. It's also something I would've told my present self who is aware I can imagine fake memories. 

Once again I can't tell what is what, or what to do next. Anyone familiar with the ""this is not real"" phrase?",0
Do you think can be an abduction?,"
Some years ago there was a periodi Where i often woke up in the night with José bleeding. 
Then sometimes i woke up because i felt like the bottom part of the bed was rised for a brief moment. 
Sometimes i wake up with sore throat. 
Last month i saw 4 times an orange orb flying in night sky from West to East and slowly disappear (because of this i begun to read about ufos and abductions) 
Sorry for bad English. What do you think? Can i be an abducted?",0

"A little of books about abduction studies as recommended by ufologist, Keith Rowell.","""Abduction Studies

Today abduction studies occupy a big part of ufology. Understanding of the abduction part of UFOs came slowly to ufology. And it was only in the 1980s that the extent and complexity of the abduction phenomenon was realized. Some ufologists believe that this is the key to understanding UFOs.

Bullard, Thomas Edward. UFO Abductions: The Measure of a Mystery. Vol. 1: Comparative Study of Abduction Reports. (Bloomington, IND): Fund for UFO Research, 1987. 402pp. This study by a Ph.D. folklorist is must reading for anyone wanting to understand the depth and breadth of the abduction enigma. Bullard concludes UFO abduction stories are much too internally consistent down to small details to be classed as traditional folklore or typical dream material.

Chalker, Bill. Hair of the Alien: DNA and Other Forensic Evidence of Alien Abduction. New York: Paraview Pocket Books, 2005. 341pp. ISBN 0-7434-9286-2. A top notch Australian researcher presents evidence that demands attention. DNA tests on hair found within the context of alien abduction tend to prove that something strange is happening. Read the full account here. This is an example of the kinds of research that could be done if adequate time, money, and expertise were ever devoted systematically to ufology. But the powers that be (the secret part of your government) are determined that this does not happen. So, Chalker and ufologists continue to be marginalized even though their work is intellectually respectable.

Conroy, Ed. Report on Communion: An Independent Investigation of and Commentary on Whitley Strieber's Communion. New York: Morrow, 1989. 427pp. ISBN 0-688-08864-3. This journalist was a boyhood acquaintance of Strieber. When Strieber published Communion, Conroy decided to see if his story would hold up under an investigative journalist's scrutiny. Conroy says yes.

Druffel, Ann and D. Scott Rogo. The Tujunga Canyon Contacts. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1980. 264pp. ISBN 0-13- 932541-7. Good book about abduction/contact experiences.

Fowler, Raymond E. The Andreasson Affair. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1979. 239pp. ISBN 0-13-036608-0. Fowler's first book about a now famous abductee, Betty Andreasson Luca. This book and Fowler's other books on the Andreasson abductions incorporate Betty's fine drawings of her alien abduction experiences.

Friedman, Stanton and Kathleen Marden. Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience. Franklin Lakes, NJ: New Page Books, 2007. 319pp. ISBN 1-56414-971-4. The definitive study of the famous Betty and Barney Hill abduction case.

Hopkins, Budd. Intruders: The Incredible Visitations at Copley Woods. New York: Random House, 1987. 223pp. ISBN 0-394-56076-0. Hopkins' second book. He says it is likely that aliens are mixing our genes with theirs, and this is a major purpose of the abductions.

Hopkins, Budd. Missing Time: A Documented Study of UFO Abductions. New York: Richard Marek, 1981. 258pp. ISBN 0-399-90102-7. Hopkins' first book about abductions.

Hopkins, Budd and Carol Rainey. Sight Unseen: Science, UFO Invisibility, and Transgenic Beings. New York: Atria Books, 2003. 406pp. ISBN 0-7434-1218-4. Excellent book about how many of the phenomena described by UFO abductees and experiencers might be explained by mostly cutting edge science. Speculation, but informed speculation — the kind that people who treat UFO evidence with a calm, patient, methodical, and rational habit of mind are capable of.

Jacobs, David Michael. Secret Life: Firsthand Accounts of UFO Abductions. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1992. 336pp. ISBN 0-671- 74857-2. Still one of the most important books on UFO abductions. Start here because the presentation is a just-the-facts, ma'am, blow-by-blow account of what Jacobs believes is happening. He says essential aspects of all abductions are absolutely real in ordinary perceptual and space-time reality. However, there are definite perceptual and space-time anomalies too. When people report that they had a missing time experience of two hours, Jacobs says they are actually bodily missing from planet Earth, or at least human beings cannot find them on Earth! A warning to extreme skeptics and debunkers: this book may be hazardous to your mental health!

Jacobs, David Michael, ed. UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge.Lawrence, KS: University of Kansas Press, 2000. 382pp. ISBN 0-0-7006-1032-4. A bunch of UFO scholars have their say about what it all means. Dry reading, but where the UFO is inevitably headed if the U.S. military opens up, which may never happen because of the serious potential national security implications of public knowledge of UFOs as a certain reality.

Leir, Roger K. The Aliens and the Scalpel: Scientific Proof of Extraterrestrial Implants in Humans. Columbus, NC: Granite Publishing, 1998. 231pp. ISBN 1-893183-01-7. You want hard evidence? Sure, everyone does. Here it is. Do you think the academic establishment has completely ignored this? Gosh, you would be right. Now, I wonder why? It isn't lack of rigor or lack of proper methodology or lack of intelligent application of reasoning in this book. It's the lack of backbone and intellectual honesty in the academic establishment which causes their abject failure to do real science in the face of hard evidence. Doctor Leir has come and gone now, but his legacy lives on in his work in ufology.

Randles, Jenny. Abduction: Over 200 Documented UFO Kidnappings Investigated. London: Robert Hale, 1988. 240pp. ISBN 0-7090-3276- 5. A British UFO researcher does a book about abductions. It is important for showing that abductions are not just a North (or South) American phenomenon.

Ring, Kenneth. The Omega Project: Near-Death Experiences, UFO Encounters, and Mind at Large. New York: William Morrow and Company, Inc., 1992. 320pp. ISBN 0-688-10729-X. An early important study of the psychological characteristics of NDE-ers and UFO abductees/experiencers. Turns out there are many, many similarities. Why? Easy. Because UFOs are part of the transpersonal/spiritual world.

Rodwell, Mary. Awakening: How ET Contact Can Transform Your Life. Leeds, UK: Beyond Publications, 2002. 301pp. ISBN 0-903782-03-1. Author Rodwell, a mental health professional from the UK and Australia, details what it is like to be a UFO abductee including the spiritual aspects.

Abducted from baseball practice," My friend Nick and I were both 13 years old at the time. We were walking  back home from baseball practice when both look up and saw a ufo it was  big. We tried to ran but it caught up to us . We were both beam up  into the ship. Once we entered the ship we were  approached by 4 grey aliens. Two took me and other two took my friend  to exam room, which had  two tables. The aliens told to remove our  clothes which we did. We unbuttoned our baseball uniform shirts, took  off our shoes, socks unbuckled our uniform pants  and removed our boxers. Once naked the aliens told us to lay down on  the tables which we did. Two aliens performed experiments on me other  two on my friend. The experiments were the same. They took hair samples  from us blood and skin samples . Then they took  sperm samples from us by putting a suction device over our penises.  They made us to get a erection which they did. Once we had a erection  the aliens put the suction device over our penises to extract sperm from  us. We both had our first orgasm. Once done the  aliens told us they need our sperm because their race is dying. They  told us to get redressed which we did. They put us back were we first  got abducted. This was only time anything that happened to us. We didn't  tell anyone.  Does anybody else have similar stories?",0

Please tell me everything you know about “tall whites”.,"A friend of mine has been having some dreams, time loss, sleep paralysis, and today she told me she was having “hallucinations”. She saw a tall person with white shin and white hair in a white robe in her closet. When I mentioned the abduction theory she didn’t know any of these things are pretty common with abductions and didn’t know of the “tall whites”. It’s been going on for about a month now so I was wondering if anyone else has had experience with tall white aliens or has more knowledge about them.",0
Weird dream last night.," 

Last night I watched that new joe rogan video about aliens before bed.

I went to sleep and had a series of weird dreams, one of them was I was in a hospital room of some kind with Drs and that were either putting or pulling something out of my arm or both. A few seconds after they did that I woke up quickly to my phone resetting itself - which it sometimes does but I've never woken up to it before - it was a bright white light before the Verizon logo. And my arm hurt in the spot that i had been operating on in the dream.

Shit was weird. I'm not one to really believe stuff like that. But i was left with the thought that it was a preparatory surgery of some kind. I have had the sense I will die soon and I felt like it was a part of a transition process.

Wether or not it was aliens or my subconscious preparing itself. Who knows. But i thought it was a cool story and that I would share it.",0

Super spookey events,"Ok so when I was 11 I woke up with fear and my room was a different color like pure green and I was scared, I ran into my moms room and was shaking violently It’s hard to explain but I think I was abducted. I had a dream about a little spaceship a soccer type aircraft but it was about the size of a medium sized dog after I ran into the room, it flew under the front door of our house and slowly kept toward the back room where I was at and then it changed to being in this strange place with a bunch of different beings. I woke up next to my mom startled but I don’t know I just pushed it back.
When I turned 13 it happened again except  I was in sleep paralysis I couldn’t move, I was looking at a computer screen that had a bunch different pictures it would cycle threw, well it got stuck on an image of smoke that looked like a demon coming out of a building it wouldn’t change to the next picture, I couldn’t move and I was stuck when I finally got the strength to move witch took every thing out of me I was filled with dread and fear and ran into my step moms living room. 
There was one more time I went into sleep paralysis In a hospital the patient next to me said he saw a lady looking figure in the corner of the room staring at me and I was making noises, I remember trying to scream for help and to move my arms and try to stop whatever it was but all I could do was tap the wall in the end before I passed out, it felt like I had a seizure the next morning after it happened. 
The last time i can remember having an encounter was just 3 years ago me and my Wife were sleeping in our old room in a basement I remember having a dream but it felt real, I was yelling telling my wife  that it was going to be okay and that every thing was going to be fine, they were taking us somewhere, a couple weeks later I was talking to her about the dream and just general freaky stuff and how I thought it was real  we lost about two hours of time when we were in the car talking, I pointed it out to her because there was a general sense that time had transpired but I couldn’t remember, she started screaming and crying running back into our house I’m only 26 now. She still doesn’t like to talk about it and gets mad if I bring it up.",0
Sleep paralysis or abduction?,"Last night was odd for me. Here is some background: I've lived with hypnagogic hallucinations for most of my adult life, their onset happening in my late teens / early twenties. I haven't had an episode of sleep paralysis since my early childhood, though. Back then, it was a fairly common occurrence, but they stopped for the most part around the age of fifteen. 

Last night, I had the worst headache I can remember having in years. My girlfriend had to put pressure on my temples (which helps a lot) for about an hour until they subsided to the point where I could fall asleep. I must of slept for about two hours, when I awoke to something touching me. The touch felt revolting to me. It was like fingers touching my feet, legs, and ribs. I remember getting angry and panicking, jumping out of bed (my girlfriend was still asleep), and running into the guest room where I tried to close the door. Something was pushing on the other side of it though. I am not a weak dude, but the thing pushing on the door was way stronger. The door burst open and there is this bright light filling the hallway, and I can't see anything. 

Next thing I know, I am in my bed, lying down with my eyes open. I am wide awake and alert, however I cannot move my body at all. I try to say my girlfriend's name several times, but I notice that I could barely push the words from my mouth. It subsided about five minutes later, and left me feeling the strangest thing. Like I was in my home with the person I loved, but it wasn't my home. Something similar but different in these subtle almost indistinguishable ways. 

I guess I am posting here because the whole thing freaked me out. Today, I felt like I was in a daze. Everyone seemed to be acting different; friends, my boss at work, the faculty at the college I work at. Has anyone had something similar happen? Any advice?",0

I remember being shown holograms,"I have a collection of different memories from my childhood that I am starting to believe might have been abduction experiences. My first was from when I was around age 5 or 6. I remember being shown planets. Now that I am older, I realize it was basically a large hologram.

I remember looking up and seeing planets and stars. It was 3D, I remember the planets getting closer and closer and then it would change to a different hologram. They showed me one of an astronaut floating through space at one point. I remember someone taller being to the left of me, I feel like they were controlling what was being shown to me or something. 

Is this common in abduction experiences? Are there other reports of abductees being shown holographic images? I’ve heard of it a few times but I’m curious just how common it is.",0
Forced OBE w/ Encounter - Maybe Someone Can Make Sense of It,"Hello. I am hoping this is the correct sub for this, as I have read other posts containing OBEs but there seems to be an alien interaction in its typical form (extra terrestrial)  Although Ive had encounters of various kinds, this deals with an alien being in the context they were non-human entities and foreign to me.  I had the feeling they were more of what you'd think an angel-type of some sort is, but they weren't glowing in light and this was not a religious nor ND experience (I didn't die, as far as I know) . Regardless, maybe someone else caen glean some insight...I hope!

Everything was a typical day for me, except my children actually went to sleep on time with no issue ( haha I should've known something was up!) I remember laying on the bed and the moment I closed my eyes, everything spun.  I had a sensation of being sucked up and out of my body as my physical self spun away.  Almost like if 2 suction cups were put together and then, after good suction attained, pulled apart. 

I was guided and although I had a wtf moment, there was no sense of panic.  Everything was dark, maybe pinpricks of light far away and curved around, as if I were in a curved place (like looking at pictures of the world- how everything arcs). I don't recall much until i reached a place that to me, i knew was Italy.  I could describe the landscape in depth, but to save time and not go Stephen King descriptive, I'll be brief.  I glided over countryside, mountains, saw ocean but *everything went whizzing by*, I could not linger and felt like I was on a rapid guided path... like an otherworldly conveyor. I only slowed slight and recognized Venice. Then it was through a peculiarly low door, something ancient.  I remember the color of rust and brick, but then it was down down down.  The door never opened and I went through a dank, cobblestone style brick? corridor.  That's when I saw *them*....
They were massive.  Larger than I could truly comprehend.  6 gigantic ""angels""? but they had their arms crossed in their chests, which had theri bodies encased or imprisoned in these bricks.  There were what I think sarcophagi in alcoves in either side.  Giant lecterns in front of them with a proportionate book.  They were all ""meditating""... but they were in chains.  Terrifying to look at something so huge and alien to me but also so human looking.  I didn't have much time to look at them as I felt my being forced into another door, for some reason in recollection i think of a pub and i feel there are parts of this my mind locked away. 

That's where I saw ""Him"". It felt as though I were in an interrogation room, as I was placed inside this bizarre, perception altering room.  It felt as if the side of this white marble half- wall counter were meant for my height yet He was massive. He wore a brown very old style outfit, I'm talking year 1AD style, almost caveman-ish in that it was only covering one shoulder in brown, handwoven linen type fabric. He had shoulder length brown hair, kind of air dried or possibly dirty, but not matted. And it had mild waves, not stick straight but not curly at all. I guess I was allowed a moment to take it all in, I am very confused right now in telling this. I don't understand.  I also saw wings. Beautiful black wings but they were ruffled, like he was injured a bit.  

There was a long silence and he was patiently looking at me.  I noted too, at this point I was in a grayish- white dress, almost like a sleeveless night gown. He was slightly smaller than the beings outside and appeared to be seated.  My mind started to drift back to my descent through the door and then what felt like miles of earth to reach this corridor.  But then he spoke.  It started with an introduction, for the life of me all I can remember is the name he gave began with a T and was 3 syllable. He spoke actual words, not inside my head, and explained he was a neutral being.  That there was a division and he refused to take sides and that he was too remain there until some event.  But he stressed that they needed me and when the time was right I would remember everything. Thar I had something really important to do and if I didn't, then it would fall to my oldest child, as she ""carries the inner mark as [I] do."" I remember that at one point, the light was dim and dank light candle lanterns, and there was a soft murmur behind him of several people.  It felt like I was in an underground pub of sorts, and there was a big bald ""man"" (he felt human) that kind of sideways said something to T and then I heard the clank of glasses. T said something back that I couldn't understand and then gave me a strange look.  Thinking now, I would nerdily say he was sort of chaotic neutral and I have to laugh at this, because I'm truly flummoxed. 

We had a bit more conversation that I don't remember, but then he told me to go back and wait to be contacted.  That I had to go past the 6 giant beings and not say a word to them.  I was gently and firmly pushed by what felt like a giant warm energy source, firmer in the middle and softer as it radiated out from the center, back into the drippy cool hall in front of the door. I put my head down and walked as silently as I could past the 6 to a bright blinding white light at the end of the ""room""  I remember it took an eternity to cross and in the musky the was a circular opening covered by a grate that looked like a well that went forever.  I couldn't step over this grate, wrought iron like a massive gate in the floor and I felt a feeling of terror if i were to disturb those... those being from whatever they were doing.  

As I got to the light, the were really large slabs, similar to the rest of the hall, only here everything was massive.  I got to the second step and heard what sounded like heavy chains rustling and felt a crippling headache. Like a migraine.  Then I heard the groan.  I hid behind the last pillar, these didn't have the candle lanterns as the ones in the room.  It was dark and the intense light didn't saturate the room, it was almost contained, i guess.  So the only light was from lanters along pillars and the dome in the ceiling. 

 I cannot emphasize enough how massive everything was, and yet I never felt small as a presence.  I just knew these things were incredibly old, strong and chained up.  Like 50 yards tall from the waist up.  The chains and wings were so much, I remember being literally and still to this day, I remain in awe.  My mistake was I looked back.  It felt wrong, even though the sounds from the chains and that horrible groan filled my head and made me turn.  1 was looking at me.  It felt like contempt.  Then I was scared.  This wing that seemed to span maybe that of 3 or 4 extended pickup trucks or suburban suvs... the eyes were not ice blue but had some green to it.  They weren't human eyes, like a baby alligator is the closest I caen think of to describe them. Jet black hair, again slightly wavy and maybe dirty.  Features somewhat asain in the brow bone and eyes when closed. Flawlessly built.  

It was awe inspiring and terrifying.  When I ""returned"" it was as if I stepped through the white light, was consumed and then I felt a distinct *pop* and I was in my bed.  A moment later my daughter woke me up.  I looked at the clock and it was 02:11. I went to bed between 00:30 - 01:00. She said I scared her because I wasn't there.  She fell asleep in my bed and why did I ""wake [her] up by jumping on the bed?"" That changed how I thought if this.  I thought it was a dream. 

Many times I felt that spinning when laying down and would wake up and not recall anything but blackness. 

Some things to note, and only because they apply.  I am a Muslim female, I don't dress in short sleeves nor, do I appear in public without a headscarve. Also, at this point in my life, nothing frightened me as I accepted things as God's will.  To wit, I do my best and if He wants to take me from this earth, I accept it and have had experiences testing and confirming this acceptance and lack of fear   The events as I was leaving frightened me to the core. 

This is not an r/nosleep. It is as real to me as my life.  I just wonder if anyone ever heard of something similar or could help me make sense.  My searches to date have yielded nothing.  I also don't practice lucid dreaming and meditation (outside of prayer, if it's considered such). As I mentioned earlier, I have had other encounters and the galaxy-eyed man that I posted about, he visited maybe a year after but not longer than that. My mental state was good and I had nothing chaotic occurring.  So, if you will ... (questions are fine, but please don't be mean spirited) I look forward to hearing constructive feedback!

PS - ETs can have many appearances, this is also why I don't state that the beings encountered were angels, aliens, jinn, demons etc. I forgot to pick up a copy of Extra Terrestrials 101 - The Definitive Guide to Classification ;)

I will see if I can sketch the room and show on imgur. I also have a feather that we found, but we're renovating and I put its cae into storage.  It is a feather easily 1 yard / 3 feet in length and approx 4 inches wide. My daughter found it the next morning in my room. My hair and skin had a strange smell to it also, as I had showered before bed.",0
"Alien Abductions: Are They Fact, Fiction Or A Sign Of What’s To Come?",0,0
Suicidal Abductee,"I guess the weight of all the trauma has caught up with me, the worst event was having an ""implanted dream"" experience where I was forced to walk across a bridge with strangers being screamed at by an alien man that we'd been ""chosen for survival.""  In that abduction experience I did not know where I was, where I was going, where my family was, hell where the earth was.  

That was the straw to break the camel's back.  Years later, I am deeply confused, why did it feel so real?  It is this trauma which is eating me up inside, I've had multiple abduction experiences of waking up in an alien world, not remembering anything.  Before these experiences I was deeply religious and had a strong faith so I was coping as well as could be expected with death, because I believed all my loved ones & my soul would end up in the same place after death.  That was my stability.  The one thing in life I need to be sure of.

The abduction experiences have made me terrorized about living, terrorized about being taken, about ""survival"" and apocalypses.  The idea of waking up in another world alone...without my family, without my memories.  I was not fearful of apocalypses before.  I was not dwelling on death before.  Now I am obsessed with death and too distraught to move.  I just want sleep, I'd sleep forever.  I didn't remember to eat yesterday & still not hungry.  I am numb, numb I can not feel. 

I keep thinking the only outcome for me is suicide, if the aliens are gonna take my world away.  I just want to die so it can't happen, understand.  I want the particles & atoms that I am made of to rejoin my loved ones after death.  But these abductions have caused me to panic, and I am lead to the conclusion that I must suicide so they can't take me.  I am hanging on by a thread.  If I suicide, my mom wouldn't be able to take it.  I'd destroy my family.  But if I don't suicide, the ""entities"" are making me believe that I'd be forced to survive an apocalypse.  This would not be a preferable option to death.

I have asked whatever gods may be that if there is an apocalypse I can remain, and stay with my loved ones, die with them and go on into after death with them.  I would never have it any other way.  I don't see a way to go on.  I feel trapped & that I will need to break my body to end this crippling anxiety over the unknown.  How can I get them to leave me alone?",0
Any cases of tech making objects transparent ?," Anyone know of any cases where aliens or ufos use some sort of tech to make objects, like cars, houses, etc, turn transparent ? Any cases involving some sort of blue light makings things transparent ? Or any colours, tech info, details on cases, years, etc ?",0
Two odd things...,"This is probably going to sound odd.  One of the entities I've seen during my abductions asks the same question, over and over.  I don't understand why they ask it, and I certainly don't know the context nor the answer.

The question is, ""Where is the ship?""

The second odd thing is a phrase that runs through my head when I think of a specific abduction experience.  ""Green means stop.""  The entity that asks the 'Where is the Ship' question was present.  I'm not sure why the phrase pops into my head.

I'm interested in any theories of what this might mean.",0

"Bright Blue Flash, anybody else experience something similar?","About 10 years ago a friend and I were walking in my neighborhood at around 2:00 am.  We live in a quiet area in the suburbs outside of a large city, so it's pretty dark at this time of night.  We were making our way back to my house when suddenly there was an extremely bright flash of blue light coming from about eye level right around the corner of the block.  We headed that way and were where it seemed to come from within 20 seconds, but there was nothing at all to see.  We both felt like we had seen something we shouldn't have, but have no explanation for what we saw.  All these years later we both still remember it vividly.  Is this something anybody else has experienced?

TL,DR: Friend and I saw a bright blue flash of like late one night in a place that certainly doesn't have anything to produce the kind of light we saw",0
Bob Lazar brought back a flood of memories...,"When I was 8 or 9 I started to have horrible sleep paralysis, it became constant, almost a nightly experience. Eventually I fought through the paralysis to where I could tear through what felt like a sheet of numbing material placed over my body. One night I lifted my head up during an episode of paralysis and at the end of my bed I saw a 3ft tall skinny figure with a large head, large black eyes, small mouth and Caucasian colored skin, this was my first experience. I had several short experiences that were similar but always wrote them off as dreams. 
I eventually moved out to the country in my teens. When I was 14, I was taken. I woke in a very plain gray room, and there was three grey aliens, pale in color. One was right next to me smiling, he had a device that looked like an Iphone and he had it up to his head as silly as that sounds but this was back in 1999 or 2000, well before iphones. Now the reason why I bring Bob Lazar up is because his description of the inside of the alien craft was exactly what I saw, three small panels, child seats and that’s it. The metal was cold to touch. I woke up at 4:23am that night, went to the kitchen and just started to wash dishes. My mom walked out at 5am asking why I was up doing chores I replied “you won’t believe me... I was abducted”. She said, I heard a door slam and saw lights but I thought it was your step dad, she panicked and called my step dad who was a cop at the time, he wrote it off as a dream, but this was too real. He never stopped at home that night. 
Since that night I’ve only had one similar experience. Right after my daughter was born I was sleeping in the living room of my apartment with my wife and baby, I woke up in the same state of paralysis but fought it just as I did when I was a kid, I saw a tall figure standing over my bed, this time I couldn’t see any other description other than a shadowy figure. I woke my wife up, as she awoke the figure faded away as if it was sand falling through your fingers. My daughter said she sees small people now, or someone would be staring at her at night. I don’t sleep at night anymore because of it. I don’t want her to go through the terror I went through as a kid.",0

Possible CE in childhood,"A couple of things 1st: English is not my native language so if there's anything that comes out a little confusing just ask away. Also, i'm typing this on my phone, so editing may be a little wonky. And last, this is a throw away account, but i Will check it periodically.

A little bit of introduction, I'm from south america, this happened in 1992, I was 7 years old then, I was not the only witness of the event because I was with my cousins that night, they were 6, 6, and 5 yo at that time, and the few times we have spoken of that night again, we still remember the same, and 2 of them are reluctant to talk about it.
It was april 3rd, i remember because it was my grandmas bday. Regular autumn night. My grandparents lived in a rural area, they had a farm and some animals. Next to my grandparents house, There was a few acres of crops, and i'm the other side, one of my uncles had his house.

It was around 9.30 pm and everyone was gathered at my grandmas house enjoying the party except me and my cousins, being kids we wanted to play, run, and do kids stuff, but being autumn it was cold outside and we were not allowed to go out and play. So my uncle decides to go to his house to fetch some wine across the crop field and we asked if we could go and play There a little bit and the adults were ok with that. My uncle accompanied us and we stayed There playing in my cousins room while he went back to my grandmas. If we wanted to go back, we have to use the phone to call to grandmas and ask for one adult to come fetch us. 

I can't tell exactly how long we were There, but we started to play a game we liked, that involved turning the lights of my cousins bedroom off, and start to throw her stuffed animals (she had dozens) at the dark trying to hit each other. The rooms window panel was a little bit crooked so There was a little bit of light coming from the outside lamp. 

We were throwing toys around when my youngest cousins receives one flat in the face, she falls and hurts her head with a chair, landing right into the only part of the room where they light from outside filtered through the window. She immediatly starts crying and we gathered around her and started consolating her.

It was then when we hard a thump in the hallway and some footsteps, we were trying to make her stop crying because if an adult was There to fetch us back to the party and saw her crying we knew we were un trouble.
There was a bright light on the other side of the door and the door knob started to twist, the door then opened like an inch or two, the light on the other side was really bright, it was not the lightbulb from the hallway. My little cousin was still crying loud and the rest of us was crouching next to her at the corner of the room, wondering what was happening that no adult was coming from the semi opened door.

One of my cousins started asking whos There, thinking that maybe it was her older brother, he was 15 back then. But nobody answered. She asked again and no response. Then we all saw the same thing a small hand with long fingers grabbed the door really slowly and the door started to move, we could see half of the silhouette of that thing, standing There holding the door with one hand, peeking inside the room, with the bright light from behind. It was in no way taller than any of us kids. We started to panic and screamed at it. I'm having goosebumps all over my body as im typing this, i can't Even describe the feeling of pure, raw, fear and dread we had at that moment. It just stood There, watching us freak out and hold eachothers while screaming and crying. For a second it looked like it hesitated to go back, but then it started to open the door, always slow, we screamed Even harder. Then it took a step forward and all i could think of was to throw some stuffed animals that were laying near us, and one of my cousins joined me. So, 2 kids, 7 and 6 years old, scared to death, throwing stuffed animals across the room to whatever entity was There standing at the door. We never hitted it, in fact i don't know who, but one of us grabbed a shoe and threw it, it slammed hard on the door and made a Lot of noise, it was There the thing stopped, took a good look again of the 4 little kids screaming and crying on the corner, closed the door and left.
All we could do was hug eachothers on the corner and cry. We were to afraid to Even go close to the door to turn the lights on. We just froze There crying and sobbing, and calling for our parents through the window. No one came, and eventually the bright light on the other side disipated. I don't know how long it was, maybe 10 minutes or an hour before someone came to the house because we were taking to long, but it felt like ages. 
My 15yo cousin came looking for us and we couldnt stop crying and told him what we saw, he seemed to believe us because i remember him taking us out of There, running through the crops and back to grandmas. Every adult There laughed us off and told it was nonsense. We were really frustrated. 
We are not really sure, to this day, what we saw that night. Personally i think it was an ET, the closest i can think of as to how to describe it is those little guys from the movie close encounters, the ones that come off the ship in the end. But we couldnt actually see any facial features because of the light, just the silhouette.
Someone told me years later that maybe it was an angel (im not religious) but that wouldnt explain the deep fear and feeling of dread that thing caused.
Since that point in my life, almost 90% of my nightmares, involve semi closed doors, whenever i see then in my dreams i jump on them and try to close them while something from the other side pushes to open it, sometimes i can Even see the long fingers holding it.
Over the years, sometimes talking with my cousins, that night comes up, we still remember the same thing. But the last time, 2 of them didnt want to talk about it at all. We all agree we saw something that night and that it scared the shit out of us little kids, and it would still scare the shit out of us in our 30s.",0
Think I may have just been visited.,I think we had a encounter tonight. Me and my gf was in bed. She was sleeping and I was watching TV. Our bed faces our TV and the doorway is directly to the left by about 2-3 feet. I happen to see a figure out of my peripheral and seen it was peeking in our bedroom door then I made direct eye contact and still seen it. It was about 3-4 feet tall and had really pale skin. Couldn't make out facial features due to looking at the TV in the the dark then glancing over and looking directly at it my eyes didn't have time to focus because it ran away too quickly. When it seen that I looked directly it pulled out of the doorway as if it was running away. I jumped up and ran to look for it then went to kitchen and glanced at the time on the stove and it was 3:33 AM. I must have woke my GF up because she came to the kitchen and I explained what I seen. She proceeds to tell me she seen a flash of light reflecting through the the cracks of the curtains on the wall. I head outside and didn't see anything on the ground or in the sky.,0

absolutely awful Experience from June of 2015.,"   I'll try to keep this clear and concise. Back in June of 2015 I was 15 years old and my sister (3 years older) was 18 and it was the summer before she was going to head off to college. Back then all 4 of us (me, my sister, father and mother) lived in a 3 bedroom house south of Portland Oregon. 
  
   On the evening of the 26th of June 2015 (Believe it was a friday) I had been at training to be a summer camp counselor all day and after 10 hours I was exhausted. Although I was physically tired I had trouble sleeping that night since my mind was racing for some reason. After laying up in bed for a few minutes I decided I would do what I always did when I had trouble sleeping, crack open my kindle and start reading. I proceeded to get out of bed and grab my kindle and then go down stairs into the living room. For reference my parents room as well as my room is upstairs while my sisters room is downstairs near the back of the house where the stairs start. After going down the stairs I went into the kitchen to get a glass of water and then I walked to the living room to sit down on the couch, I remember opening my kindle and the time reading that it was past 23:00 hrs already but I was planing on reading until I was tired so the time didn't seem to matter to me at that moment.

   After sitting down I began reading silently on the couch in the living room. About 10 minutes after I began reading I noticed a light noise coming from the kitchen, it sounded like a person walking barefoot on a tile floor if anyone reading this has heard that before. Thinking it could have been my sister I decided that I would get up to see what she was doing out of bed so late. When I walked over to the Kitchen was when the weird stuff started happening. No one was there, at first I was confused and agitated but I reasoned that It might have just been my mind playing tricks on me. Standing there in the kitchen I felt different from how I had felt seemingly mere seconds before. For one thing I was not only more tired (physically) than I had felt at any point in that night but I was also mentally tired to the point where I just wanted to go to sleep right away. My stomach also felt slightly upset (mild but not horrible nausea)

   Feeling out of it, I decided I would go back to the couch to grab my kindle and then go to bed, but my kindle was not where I left it. At this point I started to get freaked out and went to my room, When I got into my room I looked at the red numbers on my alarm clock and I will never forget what it read, 3:32 on the dot. Unable to reconcile how 4 hours evaporated in what seemed like 15 minutes I started thinking I had gone through some kind of neurological episode or that something was wrong with my brain, I spent the rest of the morning researching what it could have been until I finally fell asleep at 7 am or so. For the next few days I acted like nothing was wrong but what had happened on the night of the 26th had deeply bothered me to the point that I worked out the courage to talk to my sister about it nearly a week later.

   The moment I mentioned what happened on the night of the 26th to my sister all the normal joviality of her personality ceased in an instant. On her face was an amalgamation of emotions that I have yet to see again, there was anger, frustration, fear, anxiety and even some sadness on her face. I remembered that she looked over my shoulder to make sure my parents weren't around and she started to tell me that she's been having weird experiences similar in nature to the one I had experiences a week earlier since she was 13. Red geometric dots on her wrists, behind her ears and around her abdomen as well as missing time, items that had been moved inexplicably around the house and especially scary, she had *On more than one occasion, including the night of the 26th (the same night as my freaky experience)* woken up with her pajama pants and underwear on inside out. It was after talking with my sister in july of 2015 that I started to research abductions and it sank it that not only is my sister likely being routinely taken in the night by those disgusting things ,but that I was likely taken as well on that one instance. 

Because of this I have suffered for paranoia and constant anxiety about being abducted again, It got to the point were I was taking extra strength sleep aids to make sure I could sleep and that I was locking my bedroom door at night even though it was only my sister and parents at home. Although those disgusting creatures find locks not to be a barrier what so ever, it is more of a mental coping mechanism. Since my sister left for college and has now since graduated she had been reluctant to talk of her experiences in the past but she has mentioned to me that once she and her boyfriend moved in together that it has largely stopped.

   No matter how much I want to forget, there is a part of me that wants to do hypnotic regression therapy even though I'm terrified of what I might see and don't want to relive the experience a second time.",0
Imaginary 51 Alien drawing,0,0
Have I been abducted?,"I've always had a fascination with Aliens/UFO's.  I grew up hearing about my parents' UFO encounter long before I was born with a huge circular UFO on the Natchez Trace while driving through Mississippi.  My dad said it was over a field and that he could see things in the windows and multicolored lights going around the top and bottom of the craft in different color patterns.  They couldn't make out any details on the bottom of the craft, but he said it blocked out the stars and that he thought it was probably only about 100 feet or so up and probably the size of 2 football fields.  He had stopped the car, because he wanted to watch it.  My mother became frightened when the UFO started coming towards the car and made him get back in.  My oldest sister was a baby (now in her 50's), so this has been a long time ago.

&#x200B;

I share this just to give a little of my background.  I grew up loving Star Trek, Star Wars, reading Sci Fi books, and later UFO books.  I also had recurring dreams as a child of seeing what looked like an Armada of different spacecraft and then later in the dream, looking down onto rolling hills from inside one of the crafts.  I always took this as a dream and nothing more, but I don't know anymore.

&#x200B;

I woke up about a week ago at around 2:20am, still with my sleep mask on and earplugs in (this is how I normally sleep).  I couldn't move at all and I had the strangest feeling across my entire body that I have ever felt.  It felt as if my body was being pulled up by something.  It was almost like the feeling of suction, but very strong and full of vibration.  This happened for what must have been 30-45 seconds, but it felt like eternity, because I had no control.  Then, suddenly, I could move everything again, and I pulled up my sleep mask.  I was in bed alone.  I had goosebumps everywhere and my arm hair was standing up.  I remember reading about astral projection when I was younger and even trying it (without success).  So, I thought maybe this was what I had experienced.

&#x200B;

Then, a few nights ago, I woke up with a throbbing ring finger on my right hand.  It felt like the tip of my finger had been slammed in a car door.  My fingernail and the finger underneath were both extremely painful and sensitive, but with no bruising that I could see.  Then, the night before last, I woke up with a triangular bruise on my left forearm.  I know for a fact I did not go to bed with this bruise, and it's very painful, when I press on it (I'll attach a picture).

&#x200B;

If it were just these things, I still honestly might not attribute it to anything supernatural or extraordinary, but I have been practicing meditation over the past 6 months or so, and when I meditate before bed, I now always see the faces of what look like grays peering down at me, almost as if from above.  The first time this happened, I thought I was losing it, and it still startles me every time, because this seems to happen when my mind is completely empty of thoughts in meditation, and it feels like it is coming from outside my mind (if that makes sense?), almost as if I am communicating with something.

&#x200B;

I honestly don't know what to think of all of this, but I feel almost afraid to go to bed now.  I'm hoping others may have had similar experiences and can share.  I guess right now, I just need to know that I'm not alone in this.  Thank you for listening and thank you in advance for sharing your stories.",0
I tried to punch an alien in the face,"&#x200B;

Now, you may think I'm joking, or that this is a troll, but it certainly felt very real to me: even if I don't think it's a big deal if it IS real. In the end I just wanna get it off my chest to see if it helps anybody, or something.

&#x200B;

Anyway, to add context to this so that you approach this with A LOT of salt, I fancy myself as an artistic visionary. I've had quite a few insane, vivid dreams over the years, most of which have absolutely nothing to do with aliens, and I think about imaginary scenarios for my intellectual properties all day long. I also tend to get sugar highs, and go off on existential and inspirational escapades: the outlet primarily being artwork and writing.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, I've always thought about the cosmic, and how we apply to it in many different, and nihilistic ways: including a myriad of questions and scenarios about how real aliens would interact with us, and to what extent I could push the boundaries of Humanity's narrative power opposed to the actual, uncontrollable reality such beings would likely pose.

&#x200B;

Not to mention I've always personally feared aliens ever since I was a child: you know, having potential experiences with them, even though I never did. Paranoia. You can blame shows like Ancient Aliens on fucking History Channel, or choice documentaries on other channels for that kind of terror shit. Especially John Carpenter's The Thing, which I watched like 10 to 20 consecutive times when I was an early teenager. I haven't seen it since then on principle because of the nightmares, and my vivid recollection of it I'd rather let dull (I'm 23 now).

&#x200B;

So it's safe to say I'm not an outlier, nor innocent of mind from this. In fact, I probably could've come up with a similar scenario on multiple occasions. And when you add on the anticipation of such an event occurring, you would think that would just cause the dream to happen. I'm honestly surprised it took this long really, since it's been a chronic fear since childhood. Tbh, I kinda feel like the person(s) Maynard's talking about on Rosetta Stoned by the band Tool lol.

&#x200B;

But here it is anyway, for those that want it:

&#x200B;

A couple months ago this year (2019), I ""wake up"" to the classic dreamy haze. It's not particularly vivid, but I certainly remember the actual dream itself. Save for certain elements.

&#x200B;

So I wake up in a totally white expanse. I think I'm standing on a floor, but there's no way to tell, it's just too white. There's this blurry guy next to me, a Human. I don't know if he's wearing clothes or not. He's telling me that I'm not gonna like this, but he needs to show me something. Now, I don't recall getting a good look at him, but I vaguely think he had true brown hair, and was kinda tan. Togusa from Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex comes to mind, though with shorter hair. After he says what I recall, I don't remember him saying anything else, or doing anything else: he just needs to show me something.

&#x200B;

I turn, and look over to my right, and... There's 2 of them. One of them standing in front of the other right in front of me, facing me directly: the one behind a little off to the left, and the one in front slightly off to the right. They're not blurry. Actually, I recall exactly what they look like.

&#x200B;

They're both Greys a little shorter than me, maybe a foot or half a foot. Their eyes are pitch black semi vertical seed shapes, classic: not shiny at all though. Their heads are not spherical, but like as if a Human head has its jaw elongated downward while the skull casing is higher in elevation. Obviously bald. Strangely handsome looking, but at the same time utterly uncanny valley. However, it's clear to me their heads overall are massive, bigger than mine. Also, their noses appear to be strangely Human-like, and their bodies are slim with shoulders ending a little after the jawline, but not overtly small: actually they're a little chunky in the gut region, which I'm not sure is lighter than the surrounding skin. Their overall skin is pure light grey/gray.

&#x200B;

The second I see them, I feel a drop in my stomach: a sense of pure, unadulterated dread. They're both looking right at me. They don't speak, but they both seem to be frowning, with maybe slightly angry brow lines, and I get a sensation that they're VERY threatening. I get the feeling they're going to do something terrible to me.

&#x200B;

The dream ends when I quickly lurch forward flexing my right arm, and go to punch the Grey on the right in between the eyes: which I remember my fist getting very close, if not right on it. I don't know if it truly connected.

&#x200B;

After that, I don't know what happened. I wake up for real, and honestly only feel terror for like a minute before I get up, and look out my window at the night: starting to view it as a rather beneficial oddity of perspective. Which I still believe.

&#x200B;

On one half, even though I think it's probably just a nightmare, the implication of it being real makes it a very humbling thing. Cosmic bullshit that could kill all of us, you know the drill with all of that. I've known about those things for a long time now. But this in particular, if it IS real, it just proves to me that we're all just shit out of luck late to the race. Enjoy it while it lasts.

&#x200B;

On the other half, the matter of me actually retaliating instead of being truly powerless perhaps posing a different message entirely. Or maybe it's just fleeting flails of a doomed race.

&#x200B;

Ultimately though, I feel like whatever, walk circles around me like adults around a toddler, not like I can do anything about it. If they're real, then they're just a bunch of lousy, elitist bullies who think they can walk all over us, fuck em.

&#x200B;

Anyway, that's it. I can try and give more context if y'all want, but I really can't remember anything else about the dream, sorry. Also, sorry if this isn't the usual scenario, this is just something that happened to me.

Edit 1:

\- Sorry for any grammatical or structural errors, I typed this up on my glitchy phone: making an edit on my PC now. I only changed some misspelled words, and fixed the Togusa part of the blurry man's description (dunno why half the sentence went to the next line).

\- To add context for why I decided to post this, I actually woke up from a pseudo sleep paralysis nightmare earlier in the night. A nightmare about me in a dark house trying to sleep in various rooms while fearing a dark entity coming to get me from the closets. Not really anything to do with aliens, but I have read about the witching hour of the night, and I tend to stay up past 3am out of superstition. Afterwards, going to bed with ease. And about the whole ""abduction stigma"" thing, and why I decided to wait until NOW to post... I just forgot about it. And honestly, I don't care about stigmas, if anyone has a problem then they can go fuck off. I'm not the type to wave off things like this as crazy talk, nor am I the type to truly believe in it: I'm just open-minded about it.

\- The main reason for the Edit is a bit of info I actually just remembered about the dream, despite what I said about not remembering anything else about the dream. It's not much though, more about the reaction I had upon seeing the aliens. After reading through this a few times, I get the impression from my own impression that it may come off like I was unusually brave in the face of their opposition, which I STRONGLY would like to correct. It's a very strange feeling, but in the moment it felt something ENTIRELY unlike bravery.

\- When the blurry man told me he wanted to show me something, the transition from me to seeing the aliens was very quick: I was turning casually after all. But upon seeing them in full, you could say it was a lot like a horror movie jump-scare in ideal, though in that moment I did not jump. I do think I was slightly startled though, and I remember a sensation of the light somehow getting brighter despite the light already being bright. And when I did see them, I remember just a sheer... There was a very quick disbelief at what I'm seeing alive right before me, but then immediately a core, just crushing realization that it's real. A kind of visceral fear without adverse reaction, being in a kind of situation where YOU'RE subject: like a terrorist seeing you, though I've never been in that kind of situation. I just stood there, staring at them, and I remember my expression being completely blank from fathoming what I'm seeing. They're fucking standing there, REAL aliens, looking at me, completely out in the open clear as day to see. And I do indeed remember the sensation of there being sound, even if there wasn't any noticeable sound other than the blurry man talking to me. But when I saw those aliens, I remember a dead silence. It was extremely silent. And that moment seemed to last for at least 2-3 seconds before I did anything. It was still far too long, however.

\- And to add onto the punch, I think it might of been flight or fight rather than purely cognizant. Not sure about it, it just happened. I've on occasion had dreams about trying to punch things, feeling my punches being really weak. But in this scenario, I went to punch with REAL oomph.",0

Not sure if there could be any relation but..,"So I’ve always been interested in the topic of aliens since I was a child.. so has my dad and even my nan. I’ve seen stuff in the sky before but I’ve never really had any crazy possible abduction stories but I was thinking that it could’ve possibly happened. Every time I’ve been on holiday with my parents, the security systems always beep me and my dad without fail. Never do I have any metal on me at all and neither has my dad and the weird thing is it’s only started to happen for the past 5 years (with me not my dad) I never used to get beeped at all. I’ve not looked into abductions much or the idea of being probed but could it be possible? Me and my friend were followed by an object in the sky once so I have had weird encounters but I don’t know..",0
My story. anyone relate?,"First off I would like to say yes, I do have panic disorder and ptsd. I developed ptsd from a traumatic event that took place when I was 4 years old. I strongly disbelieve that my dreams or encounters are from that, however the dreams or abductions maybe make it worse at times. Anyway, as a young child I remember being terrified of the wind, constant dreams of flying, strange lights coming through my window, and even bright lights looking down at my face while sleeping. I had these psychic abilities and premonitions that I'd warn people about that my parents were baffled by, because they all came true. My parents had a difficult time putting me to bed. I remember coming clean with my father telling him such things like ""They're coming"". I remember him reading Bible verses in my room. As I grew into a teenager and still had these issues, he said ""What makes you so important that if they existed, they would come to you?"". It sounded harsh but true to me. I grew drained of trying to explain to anyone. I remember having repeated dreams of the same house, like a maze filled with trap doors and different escape options. I knew each time I had this dream, it was a test. It always up felt like they were testing me. Up until this day, I still have this dream. Same house, different options. I feel this scared sensation, this buzzing, vibrating, humming noise that only I can hear in my body. And that's how I know that they're close or coming. I started to see them in things I looked at. Their faces. It would send a feeling of my heart dropping into my stomach. I felt ""watched"". When I would forcefully say to myself ""I'm sick, I'm ill"" very rarely would I experience anything to do with them, like they were afraid of sickness, and I was also relieved when it would rain, a silly thought that they never show up when it's raining for some reason. I would move to different locations and it would take a few months for the sensations to start up. I always felt like I was being tracked. My first sight of one was when I was a child, I was asleep, and I awoke to a horrible smell and one standing beside me in a bright white room, it was tall, darker skin than my future encounters. I couldn't move to see but it's torso to the bottom of its chin. In my head I heard an order to ""close my eyes"". Which I always have, and when I wake up, I have this feeling of just loss, or being lost. Similar to a few years ago I awoke to seeing nothing but light infront of a being. I could feel myself panic and it said ""You are fine. Close your eyes and you will be back."" all in my head. They terrify me, yes. But for some reason, when I catch them enough to remember, it's like they know when I'm panicking, and offer me a type of reassurance. The encounters that I do remember, they're not hurtful or violating. But they leave an impression. To me they're short memories in gaps. I often times want to know more of my memories, but am too afraid. I haven't experienced anything that I remember for nearly a year.",0
I think I was abducted?,"I wasn’t really involved much in the alien scene and were terrified of the things when I was a kid. When I was fourteen, I had sleep paralysis but woke up and around the bed were four typical greys. The window was open and a big light was coming through. I got this hard fear before getting what felt like, forced to sleep. I woke up later and told my parents and they laughed so I didn’t mention it again. 
Then I moved away and I got sleep paralysis again, and when I opened my eyes I remember something being in the dark room. I remember feeling like my legs were being spread and something being shoved into my body; I think my eggs were perhaps taken? I had serious cramps the next day and my whole body hurt. 
Since, nothings really happened but just wanted to share it.",0
June 2001 UFO experience,"I posted this originally in the UFOs sub, but that place seems like it is just for sightings. I think this was more... Please read on.

I was driving cross-country with a friend, and witnessed some very unusual lights. This was in the prairies, just outside Saskatoon on Highway 16 heading east.

I had pulled over to the side of the road to take a break from driving, it was very early in the morning. There was a highway interchange some distance behind me, a hundred meters I guess. While I was relaxing and discussing the drive with my friend, I had a car pull up behind me. I could see it was a Police cruiser and it turned on its lights just before a uniformed officer exited and came up to my window. 

Usual license and registration (I hope there isn't a file on this somewhere). Basically, I was told that it was not safe for me to be pulled over off the highway here to rest from my long haul driving, and that I should proceed to the next town and get a motel or at least a parking lot to rest up in. He made a strange comment about knowing the neighborhood I was from, like he had lived there or been there. I am from a small town, very far away from Saskatoon, another province. Weird coincidence? I thought so, he was kind of intimidating but not outright threatening. I was 18, so I just did as I was told and got my car moving. The police officer pulled a 180 and headed back to Saskatoon, I assumed.

So I was driving again, and it was a few minutes later and I noticed an orange light out to the right of my vehicle. There was just farmland on either side of the highway, and the light was far away. I tried to examine it as I drives and it looked like it was some kind of illuminated structure. Sort of squat and cylindrical with a convex outer wall, some spots lighter shade in color. It seemingly was a complicated thing. I remember wondering if it was sitting on top of a hill or tower, but it was so dark I could not see. The object was pretty much motionless at its height, sometimes it seemed brighter, other times a dull glow. 

We discussed the oddity of it as we drove past. I think I made some spooky comments to unnerve my friend, but ahead there were more lights. Two of them, I think or maybe the same one twice.

I notice a light on the opposite side of the highway first, and pulled over to observe it. There was an old rundown wooden structure and a large tree that was somewhat obstructing a clear view of this light. This light seemed to be a light blue, and I only caught a momentary glimpse of it before it disappeared from view. I couldn't tell if it was the tree or the building or what, I remember intently focusing on the area, but the light did not emerge as I expected it would. 

Looking around, I saw another (or maybe the same?) light in the empty field on my side of the highway this time. I also checked for the orange object, and it was no longer where expected. This new object, orb-like, floated maybe twenty feet above the ground and illuminated the grass below it in it pale blue light. It moved back and forth, and I got the impression that it was looking for something. It's wierd to assume, it's just that if I was looking for something that I only had a general idea of its location, I would search in this back and forth pattern that I saw it move in.

Unfortunately, I took this as my call to adventure. I suggested that we check it out, which of course my passenger was firmly against. She did not like the idea one bit, but I convinced her that I would be okay. There was a small service road just ahead that joined the highway. It was just big enough to pull my car on to comfortably and so I moved up to it and pulled off the road, facing the fence and gate where the road met the field.

It was very early dawn, twilight. The light was in the field. I exited my car, friend reluctantly accompanies me in my idiotic quest.

This was a big fucking field mind you and the object wasn't as close as I had initially assessed. The ground was also uneven, undulating, rippled. I guess that's what happens when grass grows back over a plowed field? In any case, it slowed our progress toward the light. We walked steadily toward it, not speaking. Maybe less than ten minutes. I think I became confused.

The next thing I remember was that we were exiting the field walking back toward my car. It seemed to be a mechanical and robotic directive. Just get back to car, get in car. No other thoughts contradicted this objective. Daylight had dawned, we sat in my car and I turned the ignition. I struggled to read the clock's red digital display. I couldn't make sense of the numbers. I realized that something was wrong.

Well several things. Firstly, I was overcome with panic and dread. I had no recollection of what happened in the field. Similarly, my companion could not account for her time. We struggled to communicate with each other, but in time came to our senses somewhat. I was able to read my clock again, and it appeared roughly an hour and a half had passed. My throat felt like it had been scraped raw, and it hurt to speak and swallow. My friend complained of abdominal discomfort (she would later discover that she was menstruating unexpectedly and with alarming volume). The gate was gone? So was the wooden building across the highway, and the tree, and the interchange that I expected to see far in the distance back the way we supposedly came.

Panic gripped me and I felt that we had to get the hell out of there. I cannot say where we were, for sure, only that it was not Highway 16. As we fled, we did not immediately come to the conclusion that we were displaced but as the highway stretched on with no signs or markers if upcoming stops, it really began to sink in that we were lost.

A vehicle MENACED us. I have no other way to describe it. It was a pickup truck and it drove crazy down the oncoming stretch if road, and then pulled around behind us crossing a grassy median to get to our side of the four lane highway. Even though I was driving flat out, it easily gained on me and rode close to my rear bumpers before aggressively passing me. Once it got far enough ahead, it whipped back around and repeated this intimidating display, circling around and bearing down on us once more. I couldn't make out the occupants, but it was scary as fuck.

So we drove on terrified, not knowing what occurred, where we were, or who was after us. My old classic-era Nokia cell phone's battery was long dead. We drove on for what seemed like forever, I was still having a lot of trouble comprehending the passage of time. 

We eventually found a tiny rest stop on this road with an old diner and a boarded up A&W. We had breakfast, the few people inside eyed us strangely. The clock never changed in there, the orange juice burned my throat. We were scared to ask many questions, but determined that we were now headed toward Regina by talking to the waitress.

After we left there was a other strange occurrence where an oncoming vehicle lost control in front of us, crossed the median and then jumped our side of the highway. Nobody was hurt, just a bunch of twenty something Asian kids on drugs. The driver had passed out and pissed himself. I offered help, but they refused.

We ended up in Regina hours later, I remember thinking that we were being followed. In Regina we slept in my car, in a truck stop parking lot for a full day. We were both feeling very unwell.

I don't know what happened in that field, nothing good.",0
Abduction?? Let me know what you think,"         So this started happening when I was around 17 and persisted for a few months, still happens sporadically. I only remember one instance very vividly the rest seem to have faded out of my memory (I’m 19 now). I know that it persisted for a while because I remember the conversations I had with friends, family, and even my English teacher; who recommended I see a doctor. 
        From what I remember it starts with me lying in bed at some point in the night. I then feel like my body is vibrating in a rhythmic fashion, not just random pulsating. I’m being pulled from my bed to somewhere and then it’s over and I wake up. When it first started I was terrified and after a few instances I started telling people. I researched to see what was happening and I came to the conclusion it was sleep paralysis. 
         Time goes on and my experiences persist but something changes. I’m not scared anymore. I have this weird feeling that no harm is coming to me and I’m ok with whatever is happening. I read posts about people’s horrible abduction stories but something in me suggests that harm is not the intention: knowledge is. I start wanting it to happen because I feel like I’m being given something. 
          Or it could be sleep paralysis and I’m imagining it all. Everyone wants to feel important, like they are special and chosen. Maybe my mind is manifesting these thoughts to make me feel important. I honestly don’t know. I wish I kept a journal of when this happened to me so I could somehow make sense of it. The unusual thing is how often it use to happen and I can only remember one specific occurrence. I can only remember the feelings afterward and the conversations. 
           Let me know what you think.",0
Alien Abduction Case of Betty Andreasson,0,0
My experiences,"I don’t know, I just feel like talking about it tonight but can’t tell anyone in person. I’m in my early 30s now and have spent the majority of my life trying to figure out what was wrong with me and unraveling this hidden mystery in my life. 

I guess most of this might be hard to believe, but it just is what it is. 

I was sheltered as a child, homeschooled, no cable or anything. So no exposure to anything pop culture including aliens, therefore nothing that could have influenced thoughts or perceptions related to this. 
  
At this point in time I think I must have started experiencing what is considered an alien abduction experience at a young age and I think it only got serious when I started puberty -- got my period at age 11.

I only started putting together the alien connection in my late 20s, until that point I just privately anguished over unexplainable memories, missing chucks of my childhood, other things. 

Okay, so, when I was around 11 or 12, I noticed a blood blister type of thing near my knee and assumed I fell on a rock or something while rollerblading and promptly forgot about it. Every now and again over the following months, I noticed that it was still there. It was dark purple and red, about the diameter of a US dime coin or a bit smaller, and never hurt even when I poked at it. 

One day I was bored, I decided to pop it and squeeze the blood out so it could heal. I was able to easily break the skin over it just by pinching at it with my nails and it peeled off easily, almost like a blister. That's when I saw that it was actually a deep hole in my leg with some blood pooled in the bottom.

When I wiped the blood out, I saw a dark circle and thought a small rock had gotten embedded in my leg and that's why it didn't heal. Well, I eventually was able to grab it with my nails and pulled it out. It wasn't a rock, it was a long super sharp metal cone. Solid black, about an inch long, very slight ribbing on it like deck nails have to keep them from wiggling out of the wood. 

I was shocked to put it mildly. This thing was insanely sharp but indestructible. I stabbed stuff with it and tried to break it but I couldn't even dull it. I eventually took it home to show mom and she didn't believe I pulled it out of my leg until I showed her the hole by my knee. Then she eventually told me she didn't know what it was and gave it back to me. 

When I got bored with it, I tossed it in the weeds and went back to playing.

I forgot all about it until about four weeks later when I turned the leg that had the spike to the side, the light cast a shadow where I saw that suddenly I had what looked like a deep bow shaped scar where the spike had been. 

The spike had been only about the diameter of pencil lead and was sharp, so it didn't cause a big mark on the skin. The scab had healed quickly. But now I had this big wide surgically precise scar fully healed out of nowhere in the exact same spot.

There's a pic of what it looks like today. Black and White because it shows up better with the contrast. After twenty years, it has gotten a bit less deep and precise, but still largely looks unchanged. I have never been able to explain how it got there.

When I was around 13, I started waking up feeling like shit, for lack of a better explanation. I stopped telling my parents because nothing was ever wrong and I'd feel fine by lunch time, so I was accused of faking. 

Well, one day I woke up feeling extra shit. I felt terribly depressed for no good reason, my stomach hurt, head hurt, body ached. I thought I was going to be sick and went into the bathroom. My lower stomach hurt like bad cramps and I thought maybe I was getting my period. 

I tried to put a tampon in but couldn't. So I felt in my vagina (which had been evaluated in my first brief gyno exam not too long before all this as totally healthy) and long story short, somehow over night I had gone from healthy to having a stage 3 uterine prolapse. That means the uterus was all the way to the vagina opening, stage 4 is when it's outside the body. 

No doctor has ever been able to explain how this happened. I've been told it is basically unprecedented. This type of prolapse is only seen in kids who have birth defects, which I didn't. It's basically only seen in older women who had given birth multiple times during their life. A couple doctors didn't even believe my story because they said there's just no way it could happen overnight like that, that it didn't even make sense.

There were a lot of things during those years. My only friend was a boy who lived two houses down. Well, I had these ""dreams"" that involved him that lasted a couple years when I'd have been around 6 to 8. Literally one day in my early twenties, I randomly thought about them and had a ""holy shit!"" Moment when I realized how ducked up they were. 

Basically, when I was a kid, I'd have what I for some reason had thought was a dream even though I felt wide awake and lucid. It was fucked so warning. I remember on many occasions just sitting at the back of a gray room that for some reason I thought was my friends living room even though at the same time I could plainly see it wasn't. 

I'd sit there quiet and watch as he was on a metal basically angled hospital bed and someone was using medical instruments on his genitals and stomach. It was silent. I didn't feel fear, it never occurred to me to talk or even think about the situation, I was perfectly content just sitting there. 

For whatever reason, I had the idea that the person who was messing with him was his mom even though it wasnt. My brain couldn't seem to put those two pieces of info together even though I was aware of both facts separately. 

He was awake and seemed kind of out of it, he never spoke or reacted and didn't seem distressed. The person messing with him had a platter next to him with instruments on it. I can still see this entire scene so clearly in my mind. I remember one instrument was like a handheld with a long thin wire that was inserted into the boy's body. 

He was hooked up to hoses that I'd thought of as IVs. I remember that the wire instrument was inserted into his penis and at some point into his stomach. I remember a hose or thicker wire type thing was inserted up his anus at some point. I remember very long needles, fluids being taken in tubes about the size of fingers and those being sat on a tray.  I remember one big needle being put into his upper abdomen area.

At some point while watching this, I'd just realize I was lying flat on my back in bed staring at the underside of the upper bunk and what I was watching would suddenly be a scene in my head and I had the strong idea that this was just a daydream and that it was time to go to sleep. I never felt fear, never thought about it during the day, never brought it up to the boy.  It never seemed odd. 

Now, of course as an adult, all I could say was what the actual absolute fuck. Keep in mind, I was homeschooled with helicopter parents, I wasnt even allowed inside this boy's house without my parents there and also I had zero exposure to media or sexual things of any nature. So how the hell was I ""dreaming"" such realistic, detailed, fucked up things that I shouldn't have even had the knowledge to dream about?

When I was 14, my brain broke for lack of a better explanation. I also remember that clear as day. I went into my room to work on a hobby that used to bring me so much joy. I sat at my desk, turned on my boom box, and then sat there feeling empty in a way I couldn't understand. I just suddenly felt stripped on my emotional depth. 

It's hard to explain. It wasn't like depression or anything. It was totally neutral. It was the absence of something I couldn't even remember. The project was of no interest to me. Working on it felt like nothing. The music playing felt like nothing. I sat there staring straight ahead trying to understand what was going on. I couldn't understand why I felt nothing at all. 

Eventually I put away the project, turned off the music, and thought maybe I'd be back to normal the next day. That was 17 years ago. Nothing has changed. 

I am no longer a whole person. As of that day, I have had aphantasia. I literally cannot visualize a single image in my head even though before that time, I could watch movies in my head if I wanted. I can't even remember what it's like to be able to see images in my head.

The world is flat. I have not felt passion for anything once since that day. Not like depression. I haven't been depressed for years, in fact I can feel joy and happiness in a roundabout way now, but it's not the same. Like, I can watch something funny, I can laugh, I can be all the “normal” things, yet there's something missing. 

This caused me huge distress in my late teens and early 20s because back then, I could still remember what it felt like to be normal, and every day I was acutly aware that _something_ in me was missing. Oh God, I wanted it back so bad, but I couldn't even understand what it was. 

I think it doesn't distress me now because it has been so long I can no longer remember what it's like to be whole. I can no longer remember what I'm missing. Still, I know it's gone.

During my late teens and most of my 20s, I meditated extensively. Sometimes for several hours a day. I wanted so desperately to fix myself. Well, one day amid this deep meditation, I suddenly became aware of a part of my mind that I realized had always been there but that somehow I didn't notice until that moment. 

It's so hard to explain, but it's like there's a partition in my mind that I can reach out and touch but not access. I know for a fact that the missing part of myself is in that partition, but so is something I can't remember. That, I've become certain, I'm not supposed to remember. I've become positive this part of my mind was deliberaly, against all logic, somehow sealed off from my conscious access. 

I have tried to force myself into it. That is a bad idea. If I start trying to forcefully connect with this part of my own damn mind, almost immediately all the muscles in my torso lock up. If I don't stop, it's like something gets triggered in my brain and I start losing my ability to speak. 

It's literally as if my ability to communicate with the world gets knocked out if I come anywhere close to accessing this part of my mind. First my jaw will clench. Then if I try to talk, my mind will just lock up and I can't speak. Literally just go straight up mute. I've fought against this as hard as possible and the most I could get out was a few words with a terrible stutter.  It feels like forgetting how to speak. I can't form words even in my head. 

If I keep fighting against this, it's basically like short circuiting. My teeth will start to chatter, my hands will tremble, my head will start jerking to the side rapidly, my torso muscles will squeeze so hard I'll struggle to breathe, I won't even be able to form language in my head, a feeling of utter anguish will fill me, and then just when I think I wont be able to handle it, something will literally feel like it releases inside me. 

When that happens, it's as if my brain is rebooted. I'll feel as if I just woke up. All muscle tension will be gone. I'll instantly be able to talk again. The entire day up until that moment will feel like a foggy dream, I'll barely be able to rememver what I was doing before that. 

I've come to hate this. It sincerely feels like a defense mechanism in my own mind that is doing everything possible to keep me from accessing that partition in my own mind even to the extreme of making me incapable of speaking and then, if I don't stop pushing, just purging the cache and rebooting my mind  entitely. 

I still meditate. I no longer try to access that part of my mind. I'm more aware of it than ever. I could reach out and touch it if I wanted, but I no longer try because it's just fruitless, pointless pain. But I wish to God I could remember what is hidden in there. 

There's many other things but this is already so long. I have brief unexplained memories. I remember clear as day being in my favorite pet store as a kid and a man coming out from the back room and taking my hand. He asked if I wanted to go in the back and see more animals. None of this struck me as odd for some reason. 

When we went in the back, I remember the thick bright green light, so thick it was somehow tangible in the air kind of like a laser. I remember seeing a big upright tube kind of thing, and then the memory distorts badly and basically my mind will start looping and not working right, it's my single clearest memory of the green light, but I have a less clear second memory of it. 

I will randomly have flashes sometimes of odd things I can't explain. Like in Ralph Wrecks the Internet, the scene where he gets lifted up by light in the modem to get whisked into the internet, a wave of total familiarity washed over me and I had the clearest thought, “I know what it feels like to float like that.” But I have no idea why. 

There's more but I'll stop there. 

Honestly, I try not to think about it, but some days I just want to know so badly. I feel like I had my life stolen from me. I have no passion, can't truly feel properly, I can't remember what it feels like to be whole. I feel like a puppet going through life properly, I seem normal to everyone around me, I make good money, have a decent home, but ultimately I have no true sense of self or identity. 

I'd give up everything I have to access that sealed part of my mind.",0

Why do you guys share your experiences?,"Hey Guys

I'm doing a school assignment on alien encounters/sightings and one of the questions I have is ""For what reasons would the people who have had alleged encounters/sightings share?"". If you guys could give me some information that would be pretty handy.

Likely sleep paralysis but part of me wonders if it was a abduction,"I was about 15 and living about 45 min outside
NYC on Long Island 
It was winter time I think or at least very cold that night 

My childhood house was 2 Stories with the second story sitting back so you could legit climb out my window and sit on the roof or someone could climb up and into the second floor etc 

 I was sleeping facing the wall on my side with my hands tucked up by my face. I “woke up” to what I thought was a blast of cold air on my back as if someone opened the window.  I know it was wintertime or at least fall and Very cold so I would not have opened the window.
I remember thinking the clock said 3am.

As I was now “awake” i wanted  to know who the hell opened the window but I could NOT move or turn around to see it. I remember I could move my eyes and fingers and that’s it. 

I remember the cold air getting more powerful and the sound of something stepping into the room. 

At the Time I was heavy into karate classes and tried to get my hands into fists, thinking you need to be able to turn, slam your fist into whatever this is, then run to parents. I kept thinking that over and over. 

Then I felt like whatever it was got into the bed with me cause I could feel that sensation of the mattress moving cause something else was in or standing on the bed.
 I kept thinking it was getting closer and I still couldn’t move so I started to panic and recall beginning to try and pinch my hands since my fingers could move to wake myself up. 

Then I got the feeling I could move so I think I turned slamming my fist into the bed or just turned fast
nothing was there.

I think I fell out of bed or jumped out and I turned on the light. Yep nothing

I went to my door with the intention of running to parents but my childhood dog was there at the door alerted.  She was an female German Shepard and I remember her running around the room as if she was looking for something, scratching at closet door so she could look in. 

Then for some reason I got back into bed and left my dog in the room.  I woke up with her still in room next day. 

And that’s all I remember

1. What makes me think possibly just a god damn awful dream is I used to also have an issue with sleep walking as a teen.
Waking up all over the house, basement, kitchen by the front door by the back door, Put on shoes, etc so I had sleep issues 🤷🏻‍♀️
2. and that i never did run to my parents.

What is the real part that scares me and makes me wonder is I DID the next day have red marks all over my hands that my mom questioned. 
And the dog running around the room as if in search of something and she kept looking. Plus she HATED sleeping in anyone’s bedroom for longer then a few hours without starting to whine.  her spot was top of stairs or next to front door for her whole doggy life.

So I have no idea. My mom believed me cause she had similar experiences but again sure could be sleep issues I inherited. 

I’m a big paranormal and UFO believer that was one of the situations that got me into it. But again could just be cause I believe in the stuff.",0

Recalling an Experience from Childhood,"Not sure if this belongs here, but I haven't found another sub where people openly share these types of experiences. While this sub focuses on the third and fourth kinds of experiences with these things, mine is about an encounter of the first kind.


I grew up in rural Colorado. One of my friends had a sleepover and we were all laying out on the trampoline admiring the night sky. I took for granted the visibility and expanse of what I could see, because that's all I knew. Today, If I were to try to look at he sky with the intention of getting the same view I had from childhood, I would have to travel to some very rural or wilderness type terrain.


We laid there that night looking at the stars and not only recognizing but being able to tell the difference between the satellites and the stars and planets. Parents called the kids to go inside. The other kids were preoccupied with ice cream and starting a movie inside, but while I laid there gazing at the milky way, I saw what clearly was a battle happening far off. I am unable to know how far away it actually was. Seeing the beams of light and things moving around so swiftly made me feel like a crazy person. They even had opposing color schemes. I know it sounds too perfect to be real. One side had red colors, the other green. 


Whether or not children are capable of visualizing things from their imagination would be relevant here, but there was never a time in my childhood where I was able to create a reality from my own wishes or desires. What I saw surprised, shocked and scared me. 


I've not shared this experience with anyone because I don't have much information. I assume people will want to know more. All I can say is that I saw a star wars battle. For years I've put it out of my mind because it's too insane to be true. I've maintained my fascination with extraterrestrials and what this all is. Only recently has this memory resurfaced and I've decided to ask others with experiences of their own what they think.


I'm fortunate, as far as I know, to not be victimized by these things and for that I am grateful. I've heard real life stories from family who have been abducted and shown me their scars. Although I have friends and family who believe I also have friends and family who strongly disagree with any UFO phenomenon. Why does this have to be so hard?",0

Beings Made Of Light *PS MODS: I messaged you!:)*,"I have had at least one contact experience with a being whose skin appeared to be made of moonlight. 
I couldn't make out any facial features, and it was wearing a cloak, but the skin I could see was bright white and appeared to be glowing, like moonlight.
I have heard of many other people meeting them, and it seems to be an overwhelmingly positive thing. 
In my experience, it was more neutral feeling. I definitely felt like an observer, and I wasn't scared, just interested. 
I felt relatively safe as well. 
I would be very interested in hearing about other encounters with these, or similar, beings made of light.

Here's my real story. Fuck it.," 

 I am 27 years old and I have been abducted by ""aliens"".  


My story begins in what was my studio apartment at the time. The location is in Tucson, Arizona. I was 24 years old  


I am afraid to tell you my story. For my own reasons. But I feel like I have to.   


It was an ordinary night. I was going to bed. I had on my television that was playing an audio book from my local library. When all of a sudden the power went out. I didn't think too much of it because it was a shit neighborhood in South Tucson. So I waited for the power to come back on. Eventually it did. But something was wrong I couldn't tell what it was, so I just went to bed while the audiobook played.   
This is where the abduction begins. The next thing I know I am floating up into the sky. I look down and I see the roof to my studio and my adjoining neighbor is gone. Not gone just 'pushed'. It was a portal. They had separated the matter, stretched it into a circle in order to get me out. When I was high enough the portal closed and it made a sound. A sound I can't really explain but I can mimic. When the portal closed everything looked fine. Not a hair was out of place.   


As I'm floating I am looking around the neighborhood. I've never seen it from that high up in my life. I look up to see what's pulling me in. It's an enormous, circular spaceship. It's so enormous that it reminds me of Star Wars.   


I pass out. When I come to I feel like I'm dreaming but I'm not because my hand is grabbing something and I know it's real. I'm laying face down on a foreign floor. The best way I can describe it is one of those gates they use to protect closed shops.   
But the one I'm laying on is much, much thicker and stronger. When I open my eyes, I see one of them staring at me. It's a tiny little grey alien with a big head and LARGE black eyes. It has no nose or mouth and I realize that they don't eat. It's body is tiny, so tiny they have small torsos and string like arms and legs. their fingers are longish and slim. I realize why: so they can survive long term with no gravity. How can they develop any muscles, etc, in an environment with no gravity?  


As soon as I realize what has happened that I have been abducted. I immediately go into a blind rage. I go on all fours and charge the alien staring at me SCREAMING OVER AND OVER ""I'M GONNA RIP YOUR FUCKING EYES OUT!""  
When suddenly, in a selected area around me a BLUE LIGHT emanates. I can't move. I try with all the power I've got in me but I can't move a bit of my body. The aliens don't move either. They just watch me struggle. Then the blue light disappears and I collapse on the floor. Exhausted. It's then that I notice how surrounded I am. They are everywhere, but most aren't paying me any mind whatsoever. I see them flying around the ship. They are so lightweight that they move very fast and direction themselves with their minds. They remind me of fish.   


Now I can't remember exactly but I think I rushed the alien again. Most likely screaming the same obscenities. And they put the blue light on again only for a much shorter time. I'm completely spent at this point and can't even bring myself up. Then I hear it!  


It's a voice. But I'm not hearing it. It's inside my head. Like internal thoughts, but it's not my voice. It's one of the aliens. Talking into my head. It said:  
""Hey. I'm just doing my job. We/I are/am not gonna hurt you. We/I am/are just doing our/my job.""  
Then I feel EMOTIONS being pushed into my brain. This is not like how humans experience emotion brought on by a trigger. This was the feeling of guilt/remorse coming into my BRAIN and then consuming my BODY from an outside force and not only that, the emotion was AMPLIFIED to such a level that I actually apologized to the aliens for my behavior!!!!  


Writing this now it's hard to believe but it's true.   


Anyway the next thing I know I'm shambling down an ENORMOUS corridor. It is so enormous it reminds me of a church. Beside me are two or maybe three aliens. One to my left, right and maybe one behind me. The reason I was shambling is because the gravity was SO HEAVY. I could barely move. Back to the corridor. It was so tall that I don't think I could even see the top. And it was DARK. The only light to be seen was from.... The chairs.  


The chairs. The chairs. Bad memories about the chairs, man. All along the corridor to the left was a row of chairs. They were black steel and cast a green blueish hue from them. The worst part was the people in them. People. Black, white, every race. People dressed from different times, too. Some had fucking rags on, man. Like Pocahontas shit. Not all of them were filled though. Like there would be five in a group and then several empty and then one or two or three filled and then empty ones again.   


Okay. Let me catch my breath.   


Me and the aliens stopped at an empty chair. They put the thought in my head to get in the chair. I immediately start crying and begging them to not put me in one of them. I'm already sitting down in it. Their mental influence is overpowering. The alien tells me telepathically:  
""Calm down. Everything's going to be fine. It's okay. You're going to be okay. I promise everything will be fine. I'm just doing my job.""  


I take a deep breath and say ""okay.""  


The rest is blurs. I know they put something over my head that is connected to the chairs. It's like a glass mask. I don't know what the purpose of the chair is. I theorize that it scans the persons brain. But I have no clue.   


The next thing I know I'm in a room. It is BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT from all directions. Even the floor is white light but dimmed down just a bit. I am naked and in front of me are two women. One is a white woman with a slim build and bright red hair almost an orange and the other woman is a heavy set black woman with curly hair. They are both naked save for one thing covering their genitalia. It is like underwear but it isn't. It is not like anything we have on Earth. Let me explain what these women were doing. They were kissing, touching all over each other as I watched and the whole time I'm watching the fabric that is covering them doesn't move. It doesn't fold, stretch. NOTHING. It's as if it's part of their skin.   
I can sense the aliens in my brain again. They are urging me to join them and I do. But I don't do anything with them. I just sit with the women while they rub me, kiss me, etc. I can feel the aliens get upset that I am not having sex with them and because I'm not getting an erection. Some time passes and I still haven't done anything.  


BLACKOUT/TIME SKIP  


We are nearing the end of my experience. I find myself on ""the table"" you know the one everyone talks about. Yeah, that table. It reminds me of a surgical one. I can't say for sure what happened to me on that table. All I can say WITH ABSOLUTE IRON CERTAINTY is that there was one... ABOMINATION standing over me. He was tall as any human male. His head was like theirs but smaller and he had eyes, a nose and a mouth like ours and he was just staring at me. I've never felt such hatred before in my life. I told him ""If we ever meet again. I will fucking kill you."" He just kept smiling at me. He had a face like us and it burned into my mind. I will never forger it. And if I ever do meet him again. I will do my best to fucking kill it.  


Next thing I know I'm back in bed. But I can't move. Not one bit I still feel stuck and I can see HIS FUCKING FACE OUTLINED IN MY VISION. Like looking into a light and then looking away. When I could finally move I checked my testicles and all over my body and everything was okay. The only thoughts in my head was what I just experienced 100% happened and what we call ""Aliens"" are genetic engineers building something to do with humans! They don't want, need, eat, sleep, etc. They are like ants. One mind. One goal.  


I told a close friend and asked my neighbor if he had seen or heard anything weird last night. He just told me that some weird blue light was bothering him and confirmed that the power had went out.   


Anyway that's my experience. Not a very pleasant one. I shake my head every time I hear someone say ""I want to meet an alien"" and when I'm with someone like that in person I tell them ""No. You. Fucking. Don't.""  


You can believe this story or not. I know it fucking happened and at the end of the day it doesn't matter if anyone believes it or not. They are real, they are here and they have a plan.

Its like they tried to push me out of Reality,"  

The Occurrence….I don’t want to call it a dream because this felt too real and I was too aware of everything to diminish it to just a dream. But anyway The occurrence took place a few weeks ago. I was on this table and there was this being in a White lab coat kinda thing examining me. I couldn’t see its face but it didn’t feel human…It felt like it may have been human at one time but it has advanced to something that is just not human. I can’t really explain it. Its likes it didn’t have emotions, or empathy or any of those Human traits. It didn’t dawn on me that we can feel those things until I encountered this thing that didn’t have them. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was just observing me in a cold “I don’t care about you but this is my job” kinda way. Every 15 or so seconds I felt this intense pressure on my lower back…not painful but it felt like if someone took a smooth 2X4 piece of wood on its long end and just pressed it as hard as they could into your lower back. Progressively getting stronger and stronger 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is where the words that we currently possess become extremely useless but im going to try to explain. 

As the pressure got more intense I saw these images of…things that I remember but shouldn’t have?  It felt like when you see a toy or a show from your childhood, that overwhelming feeling of Nostalgia. But it was images of things that I’ve never seen. Or that I have seen but not in like this reality. The pressure would stop and I would try to catch my breath. The Thing that was watching me would take a note and then the Pressure would start again. More aggressively than the time before, this time the images became clearer and it was like my Brain was trying to get me to accept these images as real reality. Like my consciousness was trying to get pulled out of my body . It was exhausting because I was struggling to keep my consciousness in my body I felt like if I just let go and accepted it…that I would never “wake up”. Im sure that’s what Dying feels like. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Its like The thing was trying to see how much of this physical/mental pressure I could take but I guess it gave up.  It sat me in front of this screen which really wasn’t a screen but like a image being projected in my mind. It was the clearest picture I have ever seen in my life. It was a ""man"" laying down in a field on sunny day He was in this world that I remember but shouldn't . He was talking very softly it was super calming. I thought it was a movie but then the man looked over and started talking extremely aggressively ..He looked directly at me and yelled ""YOU..IM talking to YOU…why won’t you just come?"" 

I was awaken because my phone rang I was super disoriented. It was my coworker telling me that everyone we work with had just gotten fired. It was so confusing. I feel like I jumped into a different dimension or something…I just don’t know. Just wanted to share.",0
"Roach River Camps, Maine.","Edit: Obviously a throwaway account because of the stigma 

When I was young (maybe 6 or 8 in the 80's) my family stayed at Third Roach River Camp, which is a series of camps on a stream descending from Moosehead Lake in northern Maine. I can give an account of the whole day except for a few hours. 

I was sent out to put a white Styrofoam cup on top of the broken down gas pumps,(300 ft.from the camp) as a chore to placate a small child, to see how much rain we were about to get. 

On my way back to the camp there was something hanging in the air over a flooded marshy area adjacent to the camps. I felt drawn to it and couldn't stop myself from walking towards it. That's the last thing I remember until my mother's boyfriend found me bone dry on the camp porch after searching for me for hours in the rain. He was pissed. It took me a long time to understand why.

Estimating as an adult now, from a childhood memory, I would say it was at least 100 ft across. At that age the only thing I could equate it to was the Millennium Falcon, only perfectly smooth with nothing sticking out and no rivets or seams, perfectly round and semetrical. The stereotypical UFO.

What freaked me out, even at a young age was that there were no rivets or seams, it looked like it had been poured into shape, like liquid metal. It was just, perfect.

As an adult now, I'm tempted to go back to that place, but terrified of the thought at the same time.",0
Serious Question: Why do we not have a lot of video/photo evidence from abductions?,"Hello Abductions subreddit,

I was a normie on UFO's until about 2 months ago, Richard Dolan primarily being the main person who convinced me the phenomenon is real. So I'm not a skeptic, just someone with a question I'd really like answered.

I've never been abducted but I know a lot of people tell stories of how they are abducted on a regular basis. This has led me to plan how I would try to document an abduction if it ever happened to me regularly. It seems that the ET's can paralyze, mind wipe, and even turn off electronics around the house they are operating in (Stan Romanek) -but still there has to be a way to get evidence. Have any abductees tried to hide a camera in a lead lined/or shielded box? or if you live in the country, put a camera a hundred yards from their house with a zoom lens on it and a motion sensor? Thermal cameras are expensive but they can work from a distance as well. If digital doesn't work, what about some kind of analog solution with high ISO film that triggers from a pressure plate?

I know the beings are telepathic so maybe they would read your mind and find out your trap? I'll admit I'm quite naive on this topic and am just genuinely curious for some insight on this matter. Thanks!",0

Alien Abduction and sleep paralysis?,"Last night i had a really strange experience with sleep paralysis and im wondering if anyone else has experienced this:

I was asleep and like a normal case of sleep paralysis i opened my eyes but i couldnt move my body. I started bearing sounds like people walking all around my house and it kept getting louder and faster and closer to my window like big footprints and shuffling around. Then i saw a bright yellow light shine im my window and starts going in circles outside my window

after that i immediately passed out and got woken up by my drunk roommates coming home a few hours later haha

Has anyone else had an experience like this???",0
It really bothers me that alien abductions aren’t researched more,"If you’re reading this, you most likely already know that yes, aliens exist (greys, reptilians, mantis, etc) and are probably curious as to why they’re here in the first place.

While there is most likely more than one reason as to why they bother coming here, I get concerned knowing that people on this planet get abducted without really getting a choice to fight back or have the ability to NOT get abducted.

It’s so hard trying to research this phenomena thoroughly and I’m afraid we will never understand the alien species as much as they understand us, this is pretty suspect considering we have no way of knowing fact from fiction based on what “they” tell us. Are we REALLY here for spiritual growth? If so why are there stories of higher level beings harming humans? Why does one species say Jesus is from Venus while others say he’s from a different planet? So many contradictions to some stories?

What are your thoughts on the subject? Are we really being duped or am I over-reacting 🤔",0
The Mantis Alien visited 2 different family members of mine at different times,"I posted a few days ago about my brother thinking he’s been abducted his whole life. Here is his second story about an encounter with an “alien”. One day my brother showed up at my house with this story that had just happened to him the night before. 

He was sitting in his living room that night watching TV when suddenly he heard clicking sounds and a knock on his window. He got up to check and there was nothing. He want back to watch tv when he heard the clicking sound again and he ran to look outside, nothing. This continued twice more but the last one seemed to travel from his front window to the back window where his kitchen was at. He ran and turned all of his lights from the outside. At this point he was mad because he thought someone was trying to break in so he had a bat with him. 

His wife came out of the room and asked him what were all those clicking sounds she was hearing outside her window. She also told me she heard them. He told her not to worry and go back to bed and maybe it was kids messing around. He finally went to bed with a bat on him and left the lights on from the back porch. 

2:30 AM came and he woke up thinking it was time for him to get up for work. He needed to be up by 3:00AM. He sat up to look at the clock because it was next to his wife. He said to himself it was going to take him half an hour to go back to bed so he had already wasted his half an hour of sleep he had left. He laid back down, when he looked outside his bedroom door that was open he saw a tall man. He said it was about 7’ tall and had long arms passed its knees. The “man” had a long neck with a wider forehead and a very thin chin. He sat his head up and said “what the fuck is that?” And the man or alien noticed him and moved its head to take a closer look at my brother. 

He said his head moved side to side like a bug. He said he became very afraid and he covered up saying “it’s not there, it’s not there” he looked again and it was still standing there. The glare of the back porch light hit its eyes and they looked like the eyes of a fly but the color was red. Suddenly he felt very relaxed and fell asleep. He woke up at 3 not remembering what had happened. Later that day he heard his coworkers mention UFO’s and aliens when the memory came back! He then recalled that he had heard these same clicking sounds his whole life since he was a kid. He always thought someone was trying to come in through his window and was always afraid someone would break in. 

Ok, about a year later this same thing happened to my sister. For her this mantis alien grabbed her foot and she was able to move it out the way. It let go of her foot and looked closer at her the same way my brother described his. She also got sleepy and went back to bed. My sister has always lived with my husband, children and I, the scary part is that she said the only reason why she was even sleeping in that room was because I was afraid to sleep alone that night so she slept with me since my husband was working graveyard. I’m a grown woman I was probably 26 and I do remember being afraid to sleep alone that night for no reason.

Edit* my sisters story goes like this. she woke up in the middle of the night when she saw the same alien standing in front of her. The alien looked at her and moved its head from side to side and looked closer at her. She felt so afraid she started to try to move but readily couldn’t. She thought she was in sleep paralysis so she started to move her head side to side. Then she didn’t snap out of it and looked at it. The mantis alien reached out to grab her and she was shaking saying “no, no don’t touch me” it grabbed her leg and she tried to move it away. 

Once she moved it to the side she touched my foot and looked over to her right side and saw I was asleep next to her. She was fighting so badly to move because she was paralyzed but could almost snap out of it at the same time. Suddenly she was able to move her entire body. She could feel it was trying to tell her something or control her. When she snapped out of it she was able to bring her knees to her stomach and got into a a fetus position.She reached for her blanket and covered her face while shaking. She started saying “go away, go away” put her blanket down and it was still standing there, she did this about three times. Now keep in mind she wasn’t paralyzed anymore. She suddenly felt extremely sleepy and started hearing loud bangs but fell right to sleep.",0

My brother thinks he’s been abducted his whole life,"One of my brothers many weird stories has to do with him and 2 other people. When my brother was about 12, he, my oldest brother (13) and aunt (12) at the time were woken up to a strange light. They were having a sleep over at one of our older aunts house when suddenly a big bright light woke all 3 of them up. My aunts living room had a huge window that faced the street. My brother claims the light was so bright the entire room looked like daylight and it even made the room feel hot. They all looked at each other and didn’t say a word. Suddenly my brother recalls getting really sleepy and going back to sleep.

When the morning came they all asked each other if they remember what happened that night. They all had the same story, it was bright, hot and they all got extremely sleepy after being woken up by it, which all fell back asleep.

When our aunt woke up they all went and told her and her husband what had happened to them. He said the weirdest part was that she and her husband looked at each other and then said “who wants pizza?” and both left the room. He is now 37 and thinks my aunt and her husband might had experience that light before but didn’t want to speak of it.",0
Abducted? Or something else,"I remember when I was young I used to sleep walk, but this one memory always come back to my mind. I think it was a dream but it felt so real, but I was walking down the hall to my parents room and I remember looking at the front door on my way there and it was lit up blue outside and it look like there were figures behind it and when I got to my parents room, I can’t remember what happened next. I used to always feel eerie when I was younger and I was always wide awake through the night and would hear noises, my dad told me that I used to come to their room every night and just stand at the foot of their bed, I kinda remember that too. He also told me that every time I would sleep, a dog would always come to my window and bark.

Unknown Memory,"This is something that has bothered me for a very long time and I have tried asking all kinds of people about what it could be. This is the first time I'll have posted in an alien abduction area, as it never really occurred to me to do so.

&#x200B;

I have had this memory in the back of my mind ever since I was a very young child. It was something I didn't think about much as a kid, but as I grew up it unnerved me the more I thought about it.

&#x200B;

The memory is of an examination table. I was young, a child, probably only 3 or 4 in this memory, but it's so fuzzy unlike all my other memories from that age. I am in a room surrounded by medical cabinets, two strangers (Wearing white, but I was too scared to look at thier faces) and one persona who was supposedly a parent. But something felt off and it didn't feel like one of my parents at all. 

&#x200B;

There was a large, circular light made up of smaller lights above me much like the ones used in surgery and they moved it down as I was instructed to lay flat on the exam table. I remember it felt soft and warm, not like exam tables usually felt. That's when things got strange and what actually troubles me. They reached for a metal tool which had a similar shape to a small hand held power drill, but on the end was a long head that had several rows of small bristles running down the length of it. They then told me to hold still, which made me very nervous and I started crying. They told me to stop crying and it'd be over quickly and moved it between my legs where it felt as if it was inserted into my urethra. It was painful and burned, but thankfully it only lasted around 5 seconds before it was removed.

&#x200B;

After removal, I was obviously crying and scared, but I could hear them talking to my 'parent' beside me saying that 'she will probably need to have this redone when she is older'. To which my 'parent' agreed and helped me off the table.

&#x200B;

I asked my mother if I ever had any procedures as a child and she denied any knowledge of it at all. I also had my medical records checked and it was no where to be seen. There was nothing at all like it. I also researched what the heck it could have been if it was a genuine medical procedure, but I've been unable to find anything that fits it exactly. 

&#x200B;

It bothers me, because it doesn't make any sense and it was definitely not a dream. After that age I used to get severe pain when peeing until I reached around 10 years old. Does anyone have any idea what it could have been? I've posted in medical places online about this, on paranormal sites, all sorts and so far no one can give me any answers.",0

something crawlled into my room,"so i been having these nightmares for about a few years, in which alien pulse beams or vibrations into my ear that goes into my brain. but when i wake up my door opens up. im pretty sure im dreaming but, the story gets weirder its like something crawlled into my room, through my windows its not a second story, but, it is pretty high, and i cant imagine anything trying to jump up into it, but here goes, i wake up with a feeling the door opens up, and then closes. like something came in my room and fled as soon as i wake up, its hard to explain. like a game they play, ive seen them, they have monsters like with ground sharp teeth, and theyre the grey's. they dont talk to me. or anything, i do have urges to puke in the mornings. but i cant explain that either.",0
alien mindcontrol/our perception,"ive seen signs and faces sometimes, theyre bad and gets worse, like theyre invisible, cant believe  that telepathy alone can move or tear objects apart to shape these signs or faces, im sure they might be closer to their victims than we think, like a blind spot. in our perceptions in our minds, we do see everything in the back of our heads, and therefore we interpretate, everything, in the strangest ways we might even believe is our self, but if we dont see the same what do we see, and if we dont taste the same thing what do we taste, so many un answered questions. about our blind spots.

Strange dreams about alien encounters. Real or just dreams?,"So, I don't usually dream very frequently and when I do, I don't remember any of it after I wake up. However, this past week I've had two strange dream experiences that I actually remember.

First dream was only about 3-5 seconds, which I feel like is really short for a dream. I'm laying in my bed and a tall, thin alien is looking down at me. I think it was a grey alien that people tend to describe, but I'm not sure. It then moves one arm towards me and pokes me in the shoulder/upper chest. Not sure if it was a finger or instrument or what. I immediately wake up and sit straight up in bed suddenly, feeling very startled. I remember exactly what just happened like it was a memory of an actual event. Usually my memories of dreams fade and disappear quickly, but I still had this very vivid memory.

Second dream was a few days after and is slightly longer, maybe 10 seconds. I'm laying in a bed, but it's not my bed and I see that there are many, many smaller grey aliens standing all around me. Maybe 5-7 of them. I sit up and say something like ""Oh, hey there guys."" Like I'm familiar with them or something, like I recognize them and this is just another encounter. Which is strange as I think about it now, because this is the first dream I can recall seeing these things. I immediately turn to the alien closest to me and grab it by the neck hard and squeeze as hard as I can. I say to them ""If you touch me, I will kill you."" I remember being incredibly angry and threatening towards them, which feels out of character to me. I wake up at that moment.

What was weird about the second one was that it felt more real and vivid than the first. I remember having a 5 seconds of staring at the things and thinking ""Damn, these things are really real and standing right here. And there's more than one."" I feel like they had a smug air about them, almost like they were smiling or something.

I don't know if this counts as an abduction or not. I don't recall a ship or operations or anything like that. I just have these weird memories that don't feel like dream memories because, well, I don't remember my dreams.

Is this just me having a weird dream episode or what? Does anyone have any similar experiences?",0
My very very strange experiences,"So one afternoon I was in the restroom and I had the doors locked. (Prevous experinces have made me ocd about locking doors) I was looking at my hand and observing my aura. A new layer was starting to become visible and as it started forming I heard weird clicking noises outside the bathroom door. At first I laughed and said to myaelf that I was crazy but then the thing started wiggling the doorknob and I froze in terror. I realized this was very very real and I had no idea what it was or if I was about to die. It keot fucking with the door and making more clicking noises. I could hear my cat growling in the living room. It had circled around and banged loud af on my window. I then got images in my head of my fiance needing the keys and I almost opened the door. But then I realized he had the keys and was at a greinds house. I realized the thing was trying to trick me to comw out of the bathroom so I stayed firm. I heard more clicking and then it banged on my kitchen counter. After that it stayed silent and I stayed frozen in plave until my fiance came home. For hours afterwards my heart was racing and I was TERRIFIED. I was literally shaking and I worried my fiance. What was scarier is when he came home I saw nothing but I still felt the presence of it in my apartment watching me.   I'm confused as to why it stopped me from looking at my aura and ive read that they can just walk through walls. How come it was trying to open the door and couldnt get in? It seemed like it had to trick me to come out. Do you guus have any opinouns on this or info that may help?  Ive seen beige looking greys like the ones from the communion but theyve never made clicking noises before. They just stare at me when I see them. This was a traumatizing experience and I put cameras up in every room after that.  

 During a kundulini awakening I felt a presence enter the room from my window and move towards me. This is where it gets weird. I felt it go into my body and it was like the entire left side of my body was a seperate consciousness if that makes sense. 

I had a dream recently where a grey being came into my home and sat next to me while I was watching tv. He told me he was with me for an eternity and that he saw light everywhere. Idk what to think about this dream.  

Another time I was walking home and as I cane up the driveway I saw a grey like the communion ones with no clothing or genitalia staring at me from the bushes. It was hunched iver by my window. I was so scared I pretended like I didnt see it and sat in the living room till my fiance got home. Who knows what would have happened if I had gone to my room right next to that thing.  

Another time I was in my backyard smoking when I saw it by the fence and it was like 8-10 feet tall and was shifting its weight on its feet to get my attention by snapping the twigs on the ground. I of course went inside to get a fkashlight came back and it wasnt there. It made me look crazy in front of my friends bevause I was too frightened to point it out to them and just went straight inside.  

Another experience was when I was maybe 8 or 9. I dreamt I heard my sisters screaming in the hallway so I ran out and down the hall by their bedroom was a short hooded figure. I ran up to it and pulled it into the bathroom. I switched on the light to see what it was and as I was turning my head to see it I felt a pain in my left side and woke up. When I opened my eyes there was a grey literally inches from my face, it was too dark to make feature but I knew it wasnt human. I looked at it fir a couple seconds before it literally vanished into thin air. Confused I rolled over and went back to sleep.  

A recent dream I had was of myself with a group of maybe 10 to 15 individuals who were standing in a line waiting on this platform on an ocean. I saw a moon zip through the sky and dive into the ocean. A large portal then opened up in the water and I saw a very tall blue being with an oval shaped head rise up from the water and make its way to the platform. It came up to me and read my mind and I could see the images in my mind as it did. It showed me I needed to stop drinking and smoking if I wanted to know who I was. I accepted this and it came back to me and reavaluated my mind. It then told me to make my way to a doorway which was alot like the portal doors from Dr. Strange. A human male doctor greeted me and took me to his office. He told me my fiance would have a memory wipe and forget I existed. I was obviously upset at this and next thing I knew I was teleported in the air suspended over the portal in the ocean. I saw a massive city made of metal material with layers and layers of walkways. It looked alot like ZION from the matrix from air view. I was then dropped into it and as I descended yellow strands suspended in the air appeared and moved through me as I fell. Before I reached the city I woke up. 

I also strongly get the feeling I'm always being monitored. Not only from a third person view but from my own eyes if that makes sense. I always feel weird when I look in the mirror like someone else is seeing what I see. I have implants so maybe its a visual form of monitoring I hinstely don't know. All I know is in not crazy and this is very very real. I wish I was crazy :,(

lastly as far as my ""alien"" experinces i woke up in the middle if the night a while ago when i had a random memory flash. i was lying down and i saw this grey looking being looking down at me and it was smiling. it looked very different from the other ones  ive seen. it looked more human. it had black eyes but they were really bulgy and human shaped. its face was grey and round not like the greys who have bug shaped heads. i guess maybe a hybrid of human and grey idk but it weirded me out.",0

Weird dream,"So I was just wondering about a rather vivid dream I had when I was a kid. I remember walking through a metal hall with my head pointed downward. There was some sort of presence behind me, but I was unable to turn around to see it. It was almost like I was more or less a weary observer in my own body. My mind itself was essentially shut down (no thoughts or emotions; pretty much just a pure consciousness witnessing my senses) and my body moved almost as if it was an automatic command. No actual will of my own was going into my actions. I was lead to a table where a girl around my age was laying. I then got over her and, well, started having sex. Not exactly enjoyable as we were both dead eyed and not truly ""present"" or acting upon our own will. Now I chucked this up to a bizarre wet dream, but what was strange was the sensation of the sexual encounter felt very real, which is odd because I was only 13 and had never had sex in my life. In fact after losing my virginity I confirmed that it felt exactly the same. I still believe it was probably just a really vivid dream, but I was curious what other people on here thought.",0

Potential ongoing abductions - or just weird dreams?,"I want to start by getting to the point, because the long posts are intimidating to me, and I'm about to post one. So, for background before what's currently happening, I'll add that after.

So recently I was on vacation at the beach. I had a great time, but on the last night, I had a wild dream that seemed to last about 10 real world days, even though when I woke up it was just the next day in the real world. What I remember is that there were three moons. It seemed like there was the normal moon, another smaller moon emerging from behind it, and a very massive moon that I was sure was going to hit the Earth. I was completely isolated the whole time though from any other people, and made it all the way home. I was extremely afraid the whole time. I thought I was going to die. Once I made it back to my house, I literally locked myself in my room with my cat, and huddled in the corner with it. The room was pitch black at this point, all the blinds were closed, and I was extremely afraid to look outside because of the moons. Even though it seemed like 10 real life days, it was dark the whole time. The first thing I did when I woke up, was tell everyone in the room about the dream, because it was very lucid and seemed very real. It really felt like I had just woke up at the beach after not being at the beach for 10 days, even though I had been for several days.

Everything was back to normal after that. A few nights later, I had the same dream. Three moons. This time I wasn't afraid. I was back at the beach though. For whatever reason when I woke up, I started thinking that the big moon wasn't actually a moon, and it might have actually been some sort of vessel (perhaps I'm reaching).

The next night, I had a very similar dream, back at the beach, but never looked at the sky. Very lucid, at the same beach, but not in the same place. I don't remember much more than that about it. That was a few nights ago. Since then, I've been getting much less sleep, but I'm not tired. It's been progressive over the past few days, until this point. I was very tired when I went to sleep last night, which was around 11 pm local time. I woke up at 3 am local time, but feeling completely rested. I also had a very vivid dream, but this time not at the beach. This time the dream took place here. I was in a parking lot, and had my car keys, and kept pressing the unlock button to find my car, but it wasn't there. There were other cars in the lot, just not mine.

If I had any questions, it would be if this could be an abduction situation, or just random vivid dreams being a result of something unrelated, even though I can't think of what would trigger it. It was a great vacation. I had a great time.

\----------------------------------------------

Back story time:

I've seen various UFOs. The first from my adult life that I remember was what appeared to clearly be a fireball in the sky. I was driving, it was over my city, and I'm 100% sure it existed. It changed direction in 90 degree angles, and seemed to purposely change it's speed. I saw it for at least 30 seconds, was able to make it home maintaining eye contact, ran inside to get someone to also look, but it was gone when I came outside.

The second from my adult life would be a massive flash in the sky. I'd describe it as either being a picture snapped from space, or a galaxy literally exploding. It was massive, and witnessed by multiple people who were outside with me. We were actually staring at the sky, and there's no dispute that it happened, but no idea what it was.

I had another experience with a different friend, where I was driving and we saw what looked like the moon shining through the clouds, but it was so massive it didn't seem like it could be the moon. We talked about that, stared at it, and he was more certain it was a UFO than me, until we actually saw the moon in a different direction, much smaller, in the same car ride which was from one side of town to the other. He still tells the story every chance he gets. - Now that I think about it, that could have been the same thing from the dreams.

I had another experience seeing a UFO during the day. I wasn't 100% sure it was a UFO, but I was almost certain it couldn't be a plane. I was actually with my sister and her boyfriend at the time, standing and having a conversation out side. I literally pointed at it and told them I thought it was a UFO, and they literally didn't even turn around and look at it. I'll never forget that.

\----------------------------------------------

I had vivid reoccurring dreams as a very young child too. I can remember being a toddler. I have several core memories from being three and four years old, and I know I'm not mistaken, because I was adopted when I was four. For reference, I'm 27 now. One of the dreams I told adults about, that my adoptive parents remember as well, is a dark figure walking into the room and beating me. You may want to assume this was a result of something happening in real life, but it's not. I came from a very bad home, but I wasn't abused. I just didn't eat a lot, and we didn't have nice things.

In that dream, which didn't feel at all like a dream at the time, I was sharing a bed with my mom. I had my own room, but I hated being in there alone. It was a daily thing for my mom to tell me that my grandparents were right beside me on each side, even though they weren't there, just to try to comfort me. They were still alive and I saw them all the time, this was just something she would say to make me more comfortable. On this particular night, that didn't work, because I remember I was sharing a bed with her.

She was asleep, and it felt like I was awake and just sitting there. A dark figure approached from my room (the figure specifically was so dark it seemed like it didn't have a face, even though it was humanoid), but I wasn't afraid because there was a child gate on the door, and I assumed he couldn't cross it. He did cross it though, picked me up by my legs, carried me out of the room, and physically beat me. I woke up in the bed, told my mom, told my grandparents, and eventually told my adoptive parents about it at some point. I told them it was real, and that it wasn't a dream.

I remember after that, sometime later, waking up in the middle of the night, and my bed was surrounded by dark figures just like it. There were maybe eight of them, if I had to guess based on the memory, which I still have. I deeply feared these figures as a toddler.

I also had a reoccurring dream on a regular basis that always played out the same way. I was at a gas station, there were people there, but they always did the same things. It seemed like a normal situation, but one person (who was always the same person) would walk up to one of the glass windows, and smash their head into it, through the glass, killing themselves instantly. I don't know if this dream actually ties into this in any way, but I had that dream more than twice, and it was always exactly the same.

\----------------------------------------------

I had two other notable extremely vivid dreams growing up. One where I was in a very big city, that had a lot of neon-style lighting, as far as I could see in any direction, that seemed to last for multiple days. I remember specifically thinking when I woke up, that it seemed like I was on a different planet or something.

The other, I was in a more green area. Something like a field. It didn't feel like a dream at all, and there was one other person there. I remember asking the person what was going on, and they told me that I was just having a dream. This is the only time in a vivid dream where I gained full control of the situation. After he told me it was a dream, I felt aware that it was actually a dream, and just kind of walked around for a while. There wasn't anything really to do in the field, but I had full control over what I did, as opposed to any other dream I've ever had. I remember thinking it might not have been just a dream when I woke up, but didn't think much more than that at the time.

\----------------------------------------------

Anyone that took the time to read it all, what do you think? This is all 100% true. I couldn't make this up if I tried. I'm not that creative. I have my doubts it's related at all to aliens or something, but the more I think about it, the more I feel like it could be something like that. I feel like there's more to include, but I'm hyper-focused on the events I've already listed here.",0
did i get abducted by Mantis Aliens?,"I haven’t thought about this memory in a while but watching this video made it all come rushing back…
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTtLfDtZl9Y
ok i am losing my mind I have seen the alien bugs with blue gray jumpsuits described in the video where the man and wife are driving and they thought it was an ambulance. my whole life I have had very weird experiences and this is actually the most recent one. I always thought they were very weird dreams but having someone else see exactly what I have just cant be a coincidence???? All I remember is being in the middle of nowhere and being very confused, it was a dirt road and I think there was forest around me and it was the middle of the night. the strange thing is, I live in the beach in California. there is no forest anywhere near me. I don't know how the hell I got there but I was just there when I heard these very weird noises, they were almost like clicking noises but I just knew it was a language and I knew it was 2 voices arguing. Then I saw them there were 2 of them and they were standing next to a thing I knew was a broken automobile or whatever vehicle aliens use. i cant remember how it looked like at all but their outfits stand out so much! i remember distinctly the bluish grayish thick leatherlike almost destressed with a bit of shine. and there were all these little rivets and what i can only describe as zippers and pockets all over these jumpsuits (but again i knew they weren't buttons and zippers, they were also otherworldy but i have no terms for it) also iremember they had very strong, tall human bodies like 6'3"" gorgeous bodies (you could see the muscles through the thick material) but they had hideous insect faces and greenish brownish redish bug skin (but not a praying mantis green! more like an alien but i swear that part of my memory keeps switching between greenish and reddish so i don't know why my mind is fucking with me like that) the skin was a base brown with a hint of red and green to it and they eyes were much bigger than a praying mantis. but they did have similar shaped heads. and looking through pictures they do seem to resemble them the most. the creepiest thing is when i type in the description on google right now (i didn't say anything about praying mantis) I just described the coloring and that is what came up. So anyways i was a bit confused when i came to in this road but strangely i wasn't scared but the moment i saw them i can only describe pure terror. like i was sure i was going to die terror. I have seen some horrible things in my life but this is the first time i just gave up. I literally just fell down on the dusty ground and tried to melt into it. I so totally remember feeling the dirt on the side of my cheek and being too fucking scared to even look up. But i know they saw me and i know they walked over to where i was laying and one bent down over me and that is the last i remember. Other than waking up with a scream and recounting the events over and over again. ohh and i remember being exhausted when i woke up, like i didn't sleep at all.... (omg i just looked up what an African mantis looks like because of #arachnonixon post and holy shit if they had big black eyes then that's what i saw! and in the pictures some have green skin and some have red skin so i don't know?!?!)

(ahh i just got up the nerve to look up mantis alien on google and i swear if you put a dirt road in front of this picture this it what i saw!!! the fact they not only drew exactly what i saw but in the location i saw it is crazy!!!! https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjtwqrZjdThAhUJHXwKHYYDDAEQjxx6BAgBEAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fitgetsweird.libsyn.com%2Fepisode-14-the-best-party-aliens&psig=AOvVaw2GkgkfwMM5ZhF8Eokx0XXu&ust=1555486427698069",0

The Alan Godfrey Alien Abduction,0,0
"A true story told seldom in person, never online.","This is a real experience that occurred in San Sebastián, Puerto Rico in the summer of 01.  I've told it to my best friend when it first happened and my girlfriend but no one one else outside of the people involved and never online.

My mother ( almost ever year) took me to her hometown in Puerto Rico for about a month in summer of 01 to stay at my Titi Mari's house with her husband, daughter and son who we'll call Jose, Yary and Chris respectively.  Chris is like a brother to me and just 8 months younger while Yary is about 4 years older than us, we were teenagers at the time.  We were all telling ghost stories one night when Yary tells my mother and I that she's been waking up at 3am by feeling touched and/or hearing things and then just falling back to sleep.  I think that's pretty wild but holds no merit so no sweat...

My mom and Yary shared a bed while I'd carried around a small twin sized air mattress to sleep on in different rooms of the house but mainly stayed in Chris' room.  He and I, like normal, were awake joking around instead of sleepingn at about 11pm when we hear my mom scream in the distance so Chris and I dart to Yary's room to see what's going on.  We go in the room and my mom is freaking out, saying something pulled the covers off of her... I think to myself ""Really?  You're feeding into Yary's bullshit?"". Chris and I then return to his room.  I notice Yary's bedroom feels kind of detached, you had to go through a walk-in closet to get to it.  While the master bedroom, general bathroom and Chris' bedroom all line up one next to another in the main hallway of this concrete one story home, hers is across the hallway and the through walk-in closet.  Everyone goes back to bed.

Tio Jose has a brother with a beach house but not enough room for all of us so Jose and Mari decide to take Chris there for the week while Yary, my mom and I would go and meet them at the beach on Saturday.  I move my air mattress to the floor in Yary's room and everything is normal for a few nights but then Wednesday night I'm awoken by my mother kicking me.  As I'm getting up to ask her what her problem is, she tells me something woke them up by scratching on the window.  If you're  unfamiliar with old school Miami windows, they're tin horizontal shutters that open and close with a spinning handle and once they close little to no light comes in.  I ask my mom if she's sure and i start opening the window to look outside.  I see a thunderstorm in the distance and figured it had something to do with it.  My mom says that's not possible, storms out the room, through the walk-in closet and says in Spanish while looking up at one of the main hallways skylights ""See?! What is this?!"".  I look up and see different colored lights flashing through the distorted piece of glass.  I check the bathroom skylight, same thing.  I say ""it must be the lightning storm!"". My mom says ""No!  That storm was off in the distance.  I'm going to see what's going on it there"". As she's grabbing the key to unlock the gate at the entrance of the hallway (Jose was a welder), I'm standing in the bathroom and I remember... Jose installed the washing machine on the roof of the house and made a small tin structure to cover it, all of which sat directly on top of the skylight...  I ran to my mom begging and pleading her not to go outside or anywhere the roof.  She wass resistant at first but I guess she heard the fear in my voice and obliged.  We were able to calm down and go back to sleep in our beds.

Thursday was hot all day and was about to be hot at night so we decided to sleep in Jose and Mari's room since it was the only room with an ac unit and they were at the beach.  I lay my mattress between the queen size bed my mom and Yary are about to share and a row of mirrors which served as the doors to the bedroom closet.  The room had a lot of windows but they were all closed when it came time to sleep so it'd be pitch black in the room expect for a small amount of light from a streetlight that would barely shine in through a crooked window shutter.  We lay down and we all fall asleep... I'm awoken but by what?  The chickens out behind the house are going pretty crazy, it must've be that... But why isn't Buddy, their aggressive little dog that slept next to the chicken coop, barking? 
""Weird... What time is it?""
The digital clock next to Yary says it's 3:00.  That same green light let's me see Yary turn around in bed to face away from me.  I lay my head back down as my eyes adjust to the dark and look to the feet of my mattress to barely make out a tall, thin figure standing between me and the door.  The streetlight leaks in, reflects in the mirror and reveals a flash of grey.  My heart starts pumping but I become sleepy and pass out.

I awaken to sunlight coming through the open windows, I get up out of bed and try to write off the previous night as a dream.  I go to the bathroom and start brushing my teeth when I hear Yary telling my momb in the distance that she woke up again last night at 3am and felt something in the room so she rolled over to face the wall... I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I run into the kitchen where they were eating bread and butter and I asked ""you saw it too?!  Did you hear the chickens going berserk?*. She nonchalantly says ""yeah that's what I've been tryna tell you"".  The rest of the trip went uneventful and we took our regularly scheduled flight back to PHL.  

On a side note:. I'm not sure if it's unrelated but almost immediately after getting back home i started suffering from really bad sleep paralysis.  I mean having an episode in the middle of the night, turning on the tv on for comfort and go right back to sleep to another episode.  It also includes weirder events like when I ""woke up"" in my bed, got up but stumbled when my legs didn't work, busting my lip on the floor during the fall, laying on the floor calling for my mom for help until I would feel like I was floating from the floor back to my bed and waking up in the morning with a swollen lip.  This continued until I had a live-in girlfriend and now I may have a small episode once in a year.

None of this infirmation has been fabricated except for the names of the people.  All of this is true and a first hand recollection of 30yo insomniac",0
Sammy Hagar and Alien Abduction,0,0
Possible abduction,"This happened late last year (mid September 2018) and I've been having increasingly weird things happen to me since.
I remember falling asleep around noon on a Tuesday (or so I thought). I suddenly startled awake and it was pitch black outside and my houses lights were off (which was weird, considering I always leave the hall light on just for a little light at night). I began looking for my phone to see what time it was, but I couldn't find it (also weird; I always have it charging on my nightstand when I sleep). I stood up to go turn a light on and I felt extremely dizzy, and nearly fell over. A light brighter than I'd ever seen started to shine through my window (especially unusual since my bedroom is a second floor room). I peeked out my window and then the light stopped and I was frozen in place, I tried to move my body, but only my eyes would move. I heard footsteps behind me and an intense fear gripped me. I managed to close my eyes and when I opened them next, I felt like I was lying on cold metal, while a bright light shone in my eyes. I remember feeling the same terror as when I was frozen. I felt extremely sluggish like I was moving through syrup, and I looked to my left. There was a grey standing right next to me looking intently into my eyes. As I looked into its eyes, I grew calmer and my vision faded again. When I woke up, I was back in my bed, and it was still day outside. I reached for my phone and it was right where I left it. The time was around 6 am the next day.
Now, onto the strange happenings.
A few weeks after, I had an ear wax buildup in my left ear, after cleaning it out it was fine. However, I've gone through several pairs of earbuds since, as the left but always stopped working (my over ear headphones haven't stopped working though). Since then, I've noticed sounds in my left ear sound clearer than my right. Days after that, I was sitting at my desk looking through some old files when my thoughts started racing. I was suddenly overcome with the need to write, so I opened a word document and started typing the next 15 minutes were a blur, my fingers moving fast and my mind moving faster. I don't remember much, but I still have the document(I'll link it at the end). This happened a few times over the next few months and I only saved a few (the most cohesive). One time, instead of writing I drew a symbol that I have yet to identify. (Will link at the end) Since then, I've had multiple blackouts (basically memory loss) happen at random times, even while I was doing focus intensive things like playing video games.
I'm not sure if these events are connected, or if I'm just completely losing it, but over the past few weeks, I've been feeling a sense of impending doom that gets to be overwhelming at times. I just felt like I needed to share my story and get thoughts and opinions from like minded people.

The Real Life X-Files: Meet the alien abductees,0,0
Does anyone feel like they are being watched/monitored?,"I have an incredibly long story about how I suddenly feel like something is watching me, possibly inside me. I won’t type it out since most people probably won’t see this topic (if I see a comment asking about my experience them I’ll be more than happy to type it out later tonight (currently 9:37 AM where I’m at so maybe 9 hours later?)

Anyway, here’s a TL;DR just in case:

After reading a book titled Thiaoouba Prophecy (I’d actually advise against reading it because a lot of odd things started happening such as me dreaming a bright light “swallowed” me and I was in a field that had sparkles) just floating in the air and I had the ability to float; not just float up but I definitely remember making swimming motions to move around floating in the air, there was no walking)

I also read a book about some dual soul program. I bought the kindle version, would not mind sharing for free) The book is titled “Dual Soul Connection by a woman named Suzy Hansen. The book describes her life as an individual who shares her consciousness with an extraterrestrial)

Here’s where things get weird. I was studying to be a middle school math teacher. I studied for hours and on test day the questions looked nothing like the practice test offered by MTEL (Massachusetts teacher license site)

The actual math test resembled NOTHING like the practice test. However, the practice test book from a third party I bought for extra studying resembled the real test a little too well.

Anyway, during test day I had a feeling that I failed because I focused much of my turn on the mtel practice exam. With 4 minutes left I remember having 17 unanswered questions, a half assed response on one of the open response questions, and I did not even finish the 2nd open response question.

When I left the testing center I had the feeling that I failed because of the open response and me guessing 17 questions. Turns out on my score report I had a thorough understanding on open response (highest grade) and did very well on multiple choice. I’d like to point out that I had thoughts about passing nights before my score report came out.

I have so much more to tell, but I know for a fact something is “inside me” and I just wanted to get my story out because it is driving me crazy, literally (diagnosed as bipolar... I’m pretty sure someone’s pulling strings so I seem unauthentic.

Thank you for reading at least this far. Hopefully people who feel the same way can relate. I’m clearly some pawn in this abduction/alien project going on

Again, I will answer any (if any questions) you have",0
"I want to share my experience to see what you guys think, my therapist says it is psychosis *sigh*","This post is probably going to be a little bit out of sorts, I am going to try to organize it the best way that I can. Alot of the paragraphs may not be arranged properly, and I'm just going to write down some thoughts as well, to see what you guys think. I apologize in advance for any grammar errors or other mistakes: 



Ever since I was a kid, maybe as early as 7 or 8, I can recall a very, very bright light shining in my eyes, so bright that it makes your eyes feel very tired and weak. In 5th and 6th grade, I drew green aliens everywhere and were obsessed with them, although looking back I never really understood where they came from. It's something I think about often, as it is something I remember but could never grasp where the memory came from. I was frightened of the movie E.T. and used to scream and cry. Anyway, some weird things have happened to me over the years, at night.     

Instance one:
One of two people out of six see and watch a glowing orb fly around the sky, late at night 2am ish. Very soon after seeing that I suddenly lost control of my car at 30mph around a bend I travel daily. It flipped and I was ejected out, but I still can not understand whatever even caused me to lose control, as it seemed like I hit an icy patch on the road at the end of August in warm weather. We seemed to be upside down for a moment and the car suddenly flipped back on to it's trees, how I do not know. I cannot, for the life of me figure out how the accident happened. My son was 7 and was with me and he doesn't understand it until this day, either. My father had a similar experience in upstate NY, he woke up with his truck in a small ditch and doesn't remember what happened or how he got there and he wasn't hurt and didn't appear to have ever hit his head. He was not drinking or using drugs. He says he lost about two hours he cannot account for and the last thing he remembers is being almost home. This is an area know as Pine-Bush, NY, known for activity. He was working an engineering job for the government. He quit, abruptly and drove home the following day and never went back. He talked to me about it, because he knows I believe in these things, and I believe him as something similar happened to me. Neither of us have any idea how our accidents happened, these are accidents that did not involve any other vehicles. 

Instance one: Loud, vibrating, buzzing, propellor outside my window. My motion lights go completely dark and I hear someone walk past my window. The vibrating noise is so loud, that I could feel it vibrating my bones. I check the fan, it wasn't the fan. I was too scared to move or look out the window. Fear overcame me like no other. I felt almost certain I was not alone. I get this thought in my mind out of nowhere, ""close your eyes, try to concentrate on blocking this sound out and it will go away."" I try this and it works. I was able to concentrate like I've never concentrated before and I was able to block it out. I stop concentrating, I can hear the sound and feel it in my bones. My daughter was in my bed, I look over at her she's sound asleep. The next morning, my mom comes over for coffee. I start telling her about last night. My daughter overheard us from another room and said ""I heard that too, and I felt that too, it was so weird!"" I was petrified because she looked like she was in a very deep sleep and she usually is a light sleeper! We shrug it off. Eventually forget about it. 

Occurrence 2: I am alone in my room. I began to hear the sound very late at night. It wakes me, I look at my bedroom window and it looks brighter than daylight outside. I somehow knew it was still night time. I knew something wasn't right. The last thing I remember is ""They are here again, they are here, they are here."" Terrible fear and dread. I had two very weird dreams that I woke up and looked at the window and it was daylight, then actually did wake up and look at the window and it was daylight. My neck hurts, I have a terrible headache. I feel like I'm going to puke. I feel violated, not like myself. I go upstairs, make my coffee, and I go to rub my own neck, and felt a large, painful bump behind my ear. I freak out, thinking it is cancer. It stays swollen for a few weeks, and subsides, but the bump is there, sometimes gets bigger, but feels like something is inside there, my mother even agreed it is STRANGE. Could be a lymph node, but I have had a lot of swollen lymph nodes and none of them ever hurt like this. It was a feeling like no other. 

Occurrence 3: I fall asleep on my chair in my living room. I'm home all alone. I remember being between a dream and wake state and watching a bunch of figures with rounded black heads walk around my dining room. They sound like they are having a party. I act like this is normal and the last thing I remember is feeling like something is choking me from the inside of my throat. I wake up on the chair coughing and choking and it feels like cat scratches on the inside of my throat. I feel violated, headache, nauseous, like I am going to throw up. 

Occurrence 4: The most recent. I wake up, and I look at the bedroom window, it is bright, white light. I know it is still night time. I remember my whole body vibrating, shaking, going numb like I am being electrocuted. I try breaking out of it, I'm fighting it. I don't remember anything after that, but I wake up the next morning remembering what happened. I decide to tell my therapist all of the above. They think I am nuts and in psychosis. I am not surprised. 

Occurrences involving my 9y/o daughter: My daughter is in my bed again, and I am going to add that she is 9 and frightened to sleep in her room alone as she's woken up to watch felt like someone trying to grab her and take her, reported seeing what looked like a man wearing a bag on his head in her room. She was hysterical, and her arm was red. She is still scared of her bedroom. The following night I was fighting something in my sleep and could feel them grabbing my arm. I wake up to my daughter screaming my name and telling me to calm down. The next day I wake with a giant bruise on my arm. There are many occurrences that involve me and my daughter. She wakes up with terrible nose bleeds at night sometimes. Other times we both wake up at the same time and look at eachother. She sometimes wakes up and vomits. She complains of headaches, nausea, and feeling anxious  before bed alot. The doctor tells me to try melatonin or Benadryl with Tylenol, and they tell me the vomit is post nasal drip. I have always felt connected to my daughter, in a weird way that I can't describe. She often warns me of danger, and bad feelings. Tells me to slow down when driving and we end up missing a deer on the road, and have missed a few accidents because of that by a few seconds. She has been drawing UFO's with aliens inside, with a rainbow light coming from it. I'm working on figuring out where the idea came from, because it freaks me out as the picture is laying on the coffee table in view right now. If anyone wants to see the drawing I can link it, it pretty vague, but what I think is weird is how I started drawing aliens at her age. 

Some random things and background: 

I was always sick as a child, with Epstein-Barr virus, and it seemed to destroy my entire immune system as I ended up with an autoimmune hypothyroid condition. My mother began looking for specialist in the area as my GP noticed I had a large goiter in my neck. I also suffered from very, very frequent throat infections, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, laryngitis, sinus infections, allergies, migraines, and very serious ear problems. So, I lucked out with this specialist as he is not only an ear, nose and throat specialist, he is also a thyroid and parathyroid specialist. So this guy became my go-to doctor. I was his lab rat. I am 31 years old now, but I saw this doctor from about age 9-17, then visited him again at 26 when I was really ill, again. The last visit I had with this doctor, he did double tube placements in my ears, and they were very, very painful. I had them done before and they did not hurt in that way. So a month or two later, I find out I am pregnant with my son. One day, when I was about 5 or 6 months along I get into the shower and suddenly start hearing a loud, PAINFUL, intense buzzing sound. I was frightened. It did not stop right away, but it slowly got better, and I forgot about it. Years later I lost my hearing 90% in that ear and he says he could have ""saved"" my hearing had I called and told him. Ever since that incident, I hear what sounds like radio frequency, static, buzzing, clicking, chiming, and starting the left ear it will ring into the other ear. For a long time, I wondered if I had some kind of bug or implant placed in my ear, I've read stories about this type of thing happening to people, and they slip them into your ears during procedures like tube placements and free hear aid trials. The weird problems with my ears only started after seeing this doctor. I would get very painful ear aches, draining, hearing loss, blisters on my ear drums. Very strange things, ALL THE TIME. I found out, that doctor was a graduate of Harvard, and from Harvard went into the Army, to be ""an army doctor"". I thought that was strange because as a Harvard graduate, he could have done anything but he chose the army, or did the army chose him? 
Not sure why I feel like this has anything to do with these things, but am hoping you guys understand. My brothers always suffered from terrible nose bleeds growing up, some of them my mom had problems controlling. She took my oldest brother to a doctor to figure out why he was having them so badly. I have a 13 y/o son who never reports hearing anything my daughter and I hear. My mom does not hear things either but someother strange things have happened. We have two thick copper wires you rub together as a doorbell (weird I know) one night it started going nuts and we find out the wires were twisted together. We tried to create rubbing against them, tried to find any logical explanation, but nothing. We don't have security cameras, but I have weird things happen with my car, lights left on inside of it that I didn't leave on, weird fuses blown, my keyfob sometimes will not respond to my security system. I've done everything, changed the battery replaced the hoodlatch, fuses, battery and had a mechanic go over my entire car. I keep a deer cam facing my car and have never gotten anything on it but BRIGHTNESS. No animals nothing. My family says I do these things and forget but I have witnesses to say the contrary. I know this can be explained entirely but I have yet to be able to. Weird electrical interferences?

I think I was trying to be abducted by aliens.,"Before I go any further, I'm not a religious person anymore. I have a great job, girlfriend, normal life. This is very personal and something I try not to think about so I can continue to live my life.

I've had experiences since I was a child. I'm guessing this attempt wasn't my first time.

I remember going to bed around 10pm.  The time of the abduction or attempt is unknown.  I do remember a bright light in the window.  I feel myself being pulled away from my bed. I'm sleeping on my back.  I can't scream for help and can barely move. I now feel my legs dangling over my bed because I'm being pulled my something. Not hands, something else. (Only one side of my bed is pushed all the way to the wall.) As I'm being pulled, I managed to get my left hand to hold on the side of the mattress that is touching the wall. As I'm being pulled my mattress is coming off the box spring.  It feels like I'm dreaming right now. The attempt feels like I'm trying to be taken sideways as the reason why I'm pulling the mattress, holding on dearly for my life. Now the next attempt I feel myself float up, all the way till I hit the ceiling. ( My ceiling is white, very important  descriptionfor later ).

I'm being pushed up but the ceiling is in the way. I can't go any further up. I feel myself floating back down. From there I don't know what happened. If I fought it or I did get taken.  In the morning, I wake up to my mattress more than half ways off my box spring. At this moment I'm freaked out.  I do remember my head hitting the ceiling.  I go to my bathroom to check the mirror and I see the White popcorn stuff on my hair as someone would have if they hit the ceiling.

I'm stomach drops, I hurry out the front door to go outside. I'm unable to explain what happened.

This is the first Time I mentioned it here on Reddit. I haven't told my girlfriend or family. Quite embarrassing, as I don't want people to think I'm crazy. This is my past, but something I will remember always.",0

Memory like abduction,"im from brazil, i live in a small city near the atlantic sea. yesterday when i was sleeping, i woke up and then had this strange encounter, i was on a white place, more like a big room with 4 or 5 people in there, humanoid kind. then i remember they were talking with each other staring at me. then i listened a voice talking to me saying ""you won't remember this""...
suddenly i was in my room again, it wasn't a dream, more like a memory that was flashed in my mind. it could be an allucination too, i had large doses of mdma during the the week in the carnival. i'd like to know if anyone has experienced this saem kind of memory.
ps: i live two blocks away from an UFO land strip, which was built by a famous brazillian ufologist. people used to go to that place to have encounters.",0
Looking for insight on event from 10+ years ago,"Ok, so this happened awhile ago so stick with me. The incident happened when I was 9 or 10 years old.  2002-ish. My Mom (25 or 26 at the time), my two younger brothers (about 3 and 2) and I were driving home from my grandparents house. The road is mostly deserted, it's around 8 or 9pm in Catawissa, Missouri. There are houses around so it's not just vast, open land. We were turning into our subdivision at the top of a hill. My mom always waited about 3 seconds before turning because you couldn't really see who was coming up the hill. As we were waiting suddenly everything went white. Like a bright light. No sounds. Couldn't see anything but white. It felt like awhile. Not hours, but a few minutes. 
Suddenly I'm back in the car. We're in the same spot, the same minute, no time has passed. 

My mom said ""did you see that too?""

I said I did and we both described the same thing. 

We went home, we might have told my dad about it. I think my younger brothers were asleep?

It's not mentioned again for awhile. At some point when I was a teenager I asked my mom if she remembered and she did. I've brought it up a few times since but we both have no clue. 

Lighting hit the car? It wasn't storming. Abduction? Paranormal? 

Update: I just talked to my mom about it this again to make sure I had the details right. She described the same thing. 

Leaving grandma's around 8pmish, stopping at the top of the hill. Bright white, no sound, felt like floating almost. Definitely not aware of any senses other than seeing bright white. Same thing that I remembered. 

I really appreciate all of your ideas and speculations. I have been so curious about this for a long time.",0

Abduction or living in a simulation?,"(This is my girlfriends experience who wanted me to share this on reddit) 

When she was 14/15 about 6 years ago now, she woke up to a bright light in her room and recalls reacting to the light and sitting up invoulantarily before waking at exactly 6:00 am without any alarms and was fully stood up and confused as to why she was there, which is pretty unusual since she is a light sleeper. Not sure if it relates to this but it is a strange coincidence that a few days later whilst sitting in her mother’s car on her uncles drive way at night,she recalls that in the street she saw what looked like a glitch in the sky,from what I gathered looked like a pixelated glitch.

Side note, years after whilst watching the film dark skies the scene where they’re describing having an implantation scar behind her ear she jokingly checked her own and found a scar to which she has 0 recollection of how it got there and has become inflamed on several occasions.

She wants to know if anyone else has had any similar experiences ",0
Greys and Trees,"There seems to be some sort of correlation for me between aliens and trees, they seem to go hand in hand somehow.

I have dreams where they are standing among the forest trees talking to me, they hide behind trees in my yard during abduction dreams (though in the waking world my yard is purposely very devoid of trees), or their little ""scenes"" have tall white trees everywhere, though it's clear we are in some sort of cavelike place with no daylight.

I just read about the school children in Zimbabwe's experience Dr. Mack researched and ""trees will burn"" stuck out to me, I think that comes up frequently with their ""environmental disaster"" scenarios they show people. Also recall mythological nymphs dwell in trees also, I'm not sure if that's relevant or not though. I'm of the personal opinion ""aliens"" are just something more earthbound in disguise. I know many cultures all over the world throughout time have worshiped trees in some form or other. Maybe there is something else about them, besides their shelter, heat, etc. that others picked up on? Just thinking out loud. 

Just wondering if anyone else has a prevalence of trees, namely deciduous trees of the oak, beech, aspen variety, in their abduction experiences or dreams. My attention is always directed toward them, oddly. Didn't know if that was unusual or not.

Childhood Encounter on Video,"Ok, so I'm not entirely sure when this happened, but from what I remember, it was sometime when I was in the 3rd or 4th grade back in the late 90's, so maybe 1997 or 1998. I had gotten a cheap camcorder for Christmas, and my mother was obsessed with recording UFOs with it. Granted, around 95% of the crap she would record was completely explainable considering that we not only lived close (around 30 miles) to a major international airport, but there was also an Airforce Base not far from the airport. My dad was, and still is a hard-core skeptic, and always taught me never to take anything at face value. Despite all of that, there were some things that she caught that no one could explain.

&#x200B;

Anyway, one night while my mother was recording a meteor shower along with some of the neighbors. At somewhere around 10-ish, we all saw something fall in a forest situated close to a mountain cliff several miles from our house. I know it hit the ground because there was a pretty loud boom like the kind that hits you when a massive firework goes off right above you. Our first thought was to call the police, but our neighbor, who worked at the base, told us not to call anyone and went inside. I think that he said he was going to call his Sargent, or superior. Anyway, we could all see a hole in the tree-line on the mountain where the boom came from. about ten minutes later, he came back out and told his wife that there was an accident and that he needed to head to work. We were all worried that a plane had gone down, so our other neighbor went in to check the news. I don't quite remember if there was ever any mention of something going down, though I haven't found any mention of a plane crash in the area during the late 90's.

  
We stayed out there for about another half hour before we all went inside since it was getting late. My mother was on the phone with my dad telling him what had happened and asking if he knew anything that was going on (he worked at the hospital). I've asked him about that night a couple of times, and he's always said that, apart from a few car accidents from the meteor shower, there wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Any who, I went into the kitchen to grab something, and in the window above the fridge, there was something looking in. I still get chills thinking about it even now. I don't know what it was, and I was too terrified to go outside to check, but the one thing that's just been burned into my mind is the eyes. I could see the outline of the head, and these big black eyes reflecting light back from the window. 

&#x200B;

I called for my mom and told her there was something looking in from the above the fridge. As soon as my mother saw what was there, she told me to go and grab the camcorder. I did exactly what she said and she started recording whatever it was. She then told me to call my dad and tell him someone was outside the house. I remember heading for the phone...and then the next thing I know, I'm pulling myself off the ground in the next room. My mother came running from her bedroom asking me if I was alright. I don't remember much else from that night, only that we couldn't find the camcorder after that. I still don't know what happened to it. 

&#x200B;

A couple of months later, we were at my aunt's house watching some of the videos my mother had made and discussing what everything probably was. Then we popped in the video from that night. The things that I saw were...bizarre, I guess. The video caught whatever was looking in from above the fridge, but then it looked like she dropped the camera. In the frame, we could all see my feet and legs laying on the ground in the upper left side. Even weirder, there was this clicking noise that was random, but also kinda rhythmic. The video ran like that for a good twenty minutes until it looked like someone off-screen was pulling me away and picking me up. The video continued on for about forty more minutes before the tape ran out. To this day, I have no idea what happened.

&#x200B;

I was more than content to forget all about this and just chalk it up to some kind of nightmare, but a couple of weeks ago, my aunt called me saying that she found bunch of tapes from when I was a kid. Since my mom passed away about six years ago, and there really aren't a whole lot of pictures or videos of her from back then, I was thrilled to have something of her. We watched a couple of them with her old DVD/VCR set, and then we hit the tape from that night. My boyfriend was confused and I just couldn't finish it. I told her to throw it out.

&#x200B;

I don't know what she did with it, but now I'm terrified to look at any of the other tapes that she made. ",0

"1st time occurance, Word blurred out of dream","I thought I should add this to the list of strange occurances: 

In one of my recent dreams a word was deleted.  In the dream a nanny was telling me about my parents.  ""Your father was a [word or words blurred]""

I don't know my natural father.  
It felt like another manipulated dream.
It felt like an alien had reached into my mind and blurred out words from my dream.  Like when a DJ scratches a record.   I have never experienced this effect before.  I don't like to think my mind is being manipulated, even my dreams, but I feel that my mind is being manipulated.  

I would have liked to know what the scratched out words were, even if it were only a dream.",0
I remember the light.,"So.. I hate to have like the most typical story ever, and I'm not saying I was abducted or somehow dreaming or what.. 

So in either 8th or 9th grade, I had a loft bed in my room on the top floor of our split level house. I have 3 windows all on one wall that make one big window and my feet faced the window all the way to the right. Just as I lay down and close my eyes, I notice like a flashlight shining in my eyes. I prop up on my elbows and look out. We have a telephone pole in out backyard and so I immediately thought why are they up there shining a light on my face. It was level with my face. But we also have trees and I didnt see any leaves blocking the light even though it looked really far away. As I stared and questioned it, it looked like it was getting closer but the light was brighter.. and like pure white. I couldnt move and I remember just thinking ""it's going to hit me and I need to move now.""
And then all of a sudden I was awake and it was morning. I was in the same position on my elbows, still in panic but i wasnt tired. Like i slept the whole night.
I didnt know anything about aliens at that time. It wasnt an interest. Then when I had my son, I watched some documentary about implants and scars of people who claimed to be abducted.. i had a scar on my ankle i never knew how i got but i just never questioned it. It's like right above my ankle. A perfect line. I've gotten questions about it asking if I've had surgery a long time ago, but I've had nothing like that.
I have no idea if they're connected at all. Or if I was dreaming that night. Or if I had an injury as a kid that I dont remember. But i certainly dont remember that injury or a healing process. I dont remember what happened the rest of that night. I remember that light though and i remember how scared i was. And i dont remember anything like that afterwards.

My Strange Experiences concerning Aliens,"This a really long post

I spent a few weeks on an abductions reddit thread before I got the courage to post my own experiences. I honestly don't know if it's aliens, the government, spirits, or my own mind. I know that i've had several experiences.

Ever since I was a kid I remember being fascinated by anything paranormal, especially aliens. It all started when I was 5 (31 now) and I was in my parents room with my Mom and brother watching an alien special. The special showcased a mother who had apparently been abducted often. During one of her abductions, (she could feel it before they happened) she felt that this time they were coming for her kids too. She took her kids from their bedroom, and hid them in the closet and put herself in a spot where they would easily take her and just her. Well during this special I remember thinking to myself that this lady is being silly. All she has to do is deadbolt her doors. That's when the special showed the aliens unlock the doors from the outside without even touching it. This freaked me out. It scared me so much that I remember that fear to this day. It's funny now that i'm older, but as a kid, the idea that there could be things from another world to enter and leave your home as they please and take whoever they want for who knows how long was horrific.

Since this special I remember being terrified of the dark. I began to refuse (for years well into my teenage years) to sleep in my room. I would rather sleep downstairs in the living room where I wasn't cornered, where I could see them coming. What was odd was that my brothers and sister also preferred to sleep downstairs. I would have friends over and one (we'll call him Dylan) stopped coming over because as he claimed, he woke up on the dinner table sprawled out as if he was being operated on. Before Dylan stopped coming over we would always talk about UFO's and aliens and all that. One night while playing Mortal Kombat on SNES, he said he could see a UFO outside through the window (it was night at this time) I looked but couldn't see anything, but still got nervous. He could have been lying to me, kids do all the time anyways. However, I remember either later that night or another night he was over when we were imagining we were fighting off aliens on some distant world in my living room, I glanced to where the front door and stairs met and there was this huge glowing-white-alien-looking-thing reaching out to me. It stopped me in my tracks. I remember it clear today as the night i saw it. It's mouth was open as if trying to call me over while its left arm and hand were stretched to me with its right hand resting on the stair railing. We stopped playing after that and went to bed. Another time when I was at his house we were (you guessed it) talking about aliens again. Independence Day the movie had just come out recently and I was trying to explain what the aliens looked like when they didn't have the suit on to my friend and this is when I looked under his bed (since I slept on the floor in his room when I was over there) and saw an alien that looked just like the one in the movie. It was dark under his bed, but I remember telling it in my mind to stay under there. I remember seeing it (for a full minute or two before looking back up to Dylan). the alien's eyes glistened from the lamp in his room and stared back at me. I figured it must be my overactive imagination since we were talking about aliens, that there must be something under the bed that is creating this illusion. (I began to use to this rationale to dismiss a lot of experiences and still do to this day, but as I get older I do wonder). When I woke up, I looked to see what could have been playing tricks on me and found nothing that would have mimicked those eyes, at least to my memory and memory can be a tricky thing.

Fast forward to my young teen years and i'm outside of my house. Looking up at the sky wanting to see a UFO (I did this a lot) this night in particular though I scanned the night sky and saw what looked like a diamond shaped craft with the top and bottom flattened and two large rows of hug windows in the middle that separated the top and bottom halves of the ship. This thing was huge. about the size of 5 or 6 commercial airliners. I remember faint lights blinking from it. I stood there dumbfounded. ""Is this for real?"" I asked myself. I am super skeptical, even if I experience something I always try to rationalize it. Eventually I head back inside. Here's where my memory gets foggy, but i definitely remember being freaked out and asking myself the same questions. I remember the time being one thing, like 9:12 pm, but when I went back in it close to 10:12 pm. I had only gone outside to see for ten minutes it seemed. Was i outside for longer? I figured that I must have misread the time or stayed out longer than I thought, but it bothered me and still does. I really can't explain it.

Sometime after this, maybe a year or so, I am watching an Alien UFO documentary on TV that goes over like 10 or 20 UFO Hoaxes that happened. Eventually, I come upon the UFO that I saw. It fit the description perfectly. I believe they said it was two brothers that caused the hoax and they did it by projecting an image on a surface that would catch it. But there was nothing but some clouds and the night sky that surrounded this UFO. That never made sense to me, but it did help me put away my obsession for a long time as it was something truly terrifying to me.

As time passed by I would have bouts of alien obsession, but then they would go away. As I grew older I became more religious and this pretty much took me away from my obsession. I had had religious experiences or spiritual experiences if you will, all my life but as I grew older and began to understand what i believe was and is my relationship with God, I really didn't know where aliens fit (and still don't. In many ways I agnostic, but I am definitely am a Christian as I believe. I admit there's a lot I just don't know.)

During the middle of my most religious time when I was 19 I was asleep in my apartment in Bardstown, KY. My roommate and I shared a room as it was a one bedroom place, but had separate beds. I remember waking up one early morning. A sense of sheer fear washed over me. A coldness that is hard to describe. As if the warmth had left my body. I heard a strange sound. I've seen others describe it as a wobbling sound or a metal grinding weird screeching. Whatever it was, it was right outside my window and then I had the strongest feeling that I was not alone in that room with my roommate. I felt very strong that there were two beings at the door way. I'm not sure if I couldn't move because of sleep paralysis (which i have experienced few times in life) or if I was just that scared but I shut my eyes tight until the feeling eased away and I finally gathered the courage to look. Nothing was there, only the dark of morning. I could not get back to sleep and stayed up the rest of the day. I never told my roommate what happened either.

I had several more weird experiences, I won't go into them as they get pretty personal, but by the time I was 21 I began to feel that aliens and demons were connected. They shared the same fear the same freezing cold that surged throughout my body and spirit. (I have had multiple spiritual experiences as well in case that is not clear. Experienced exorcisms and healing on first hand accounts. It is these things that are too personal for me to delve into)

Its been over a decade since that night in Bardstown, KY, but I still wonder. Was I abducted? Was it sleep paralysis? I have a friend that suffers from it and he can affirm the crazy stuff he sees but he is never hurt. I honestly don't know. the more i've delved into the topic the more i delved into my religion and pondered about the concept of God. After years of thinking and swaying I've realized that I believe in God, I believe in Jesus as the Messiah. I just don't know what to make of what these other experiences I had were. I don't doubt there is life beyond our world. But i've always wondered what those experiences were and still do.

&#x200B;

TL:DR I've had various strange experiences ranging from aliens to demons to miracles that I am not sure how they fit.

Hmmmm,Okay so how can you identify if you’ve been abducted? Me and my boyfriend last night were laying down laround 11pm and we both don’t remember falling asleep at all. I eventually woke up around 4am (still confused about passing out) all the lights were on and my boyfriend has a bruise on his hip I have two one on my arm and back. I’ve been trying to research it to see if I can come across anyone else who has maybe something similar happen. We’re both convinced it was aliens but I guess there’s no way to confirm it haha ,0
"What is the creepiest, most unexplainable thing that's ever happened to you?","I'm looking to interview people about their encounters with the unknown. The idea is to compile these testimonials and explore where these encounters and experiences overlap and report any findings I may stumble upon.

If you've got a story that can't be explained, I want to hear it. We can do the interview over the phone or via email, whichever you prefer – you can use an alias if you're uncomfortable with sharing your real name, no worries there. Just send me a private message to get started!",0

Cat headed alien?,"I used to lucid dream frequently and would mess around with it, until I had a few experiences with entities(all human) that scared me so now I just wake myself up when I find myself in a lucid state. So I was telling some of my stories to a few girls, one of which is a hardcore astro chick who spends all of her free time learning about all things woowoo. Anyway one girl asked if I had ever woken up lucid and not been in my bed, I said no but one time when I went to leave my bedroom, instead of the rest of my house being there there was a long checkerboard hallway and at the end there was a figure which was the body of a human wearing a long tan cloak/trenchcoat and the head of a blue cat. He was just staring at me from the end of this hallway and I did not feel threatened in any way(as I would with some entities). I was just thinking woah this is weird, we stared at each other for about a minute and I decided it was too weird to approach him and I woke myself up. So the girl who knows about this type of stuff goes ""that wasn't an entity, that was an alien"" and she goes on to tell me that her friend has a tarot deck that has drawings of the cat headed aliens and they are all on checkerboard floors. This girl is not a liar so now I am very intrigued by the whole experience and wondering if anybody has had experiences with cat headed aliens, or knows anything about them?",0
I have so many questions...,0,0
"All honest people are open, warm and friendly.","All honest people are open, warm and friendly.

Science that is driven only by data, and not by human competitive nature, is always open, warm, and friendly. The data always speaks for itself. There is no need for a defense of data that is real. Pride does not belong in science. When human beings tell the truth, they are friendly, cooperative, open, and warm. When human beings do not tell the truth, they are arrogant, defensive, angry, and competitive. 

This is how we sort out all the bullshit: human drama from data itself. Let the data speak for itself. Allow studies of consciousness to continue without character assassination (debunking over skepticism).

Skepticism is healthy. It allows for doubt, but also the continuation of seeking more data.

Debunking is hateful. It is doubtful and controlling. Debunking (being overly critical without reasoning) does not allow for continuation of seeking more data. Debunking is psychological control. This is not science.

In science - the data always wins. Data is independent of interpretation. With enough data, and with a variety of independent sources of data, the truth becomes apparent.

There is no anger in science. There is only friendship and honesty. Science is DRIVEN by logic primarily, and then by data. If logic is not sound (as in competitive in nature, and not data driven), then the data will also not be sound.

There is no authority or authoritarianism in science. There is ONLY data and logic - and that’s it! All data and all logic remain independent of the individual. Pride and science are incompatible.

I  am 28 years old this year and I will die for my faith. I prayed to God,  without even knowing who He was and He was faithful to me and showed me  the truth of who He is, by using the evil I was involved with. He can  do the same for you, pray to God, He will answer you.

**And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. - Jeremiah 29:13**

I  have been through a lot of struggles with my faith, having doubts etc  but I never stopped trusting God and He has always showed me the way and  the truth of a thing.

Horrible nightmares and episodes,Since I was started to have trouble at home since I moved back into my childhood house I decided to travel for work. (Check my last post for details.) Since I have been traveling my nightmares have become more realistic and more “painful”. My chest aches more in the areas around the marks I still have. (Again check my last few posts for details.) I’m not sure why this has started happening again though I am becoming more and more terrified. I am traveling with my best friend (who knows nothing of what had been happening aside from the nightmares and marks on my chest) and neither of us have had missing time though we have seen strange lights in the sky several times. If anyone had any idea as to why this is happening or had an opinion please leave a comment. Please check my last few posts to get a better insight into my story. Please help and thank you.,0
Cross the Threshold,"Minor experience in which a few nights ago I attempted to ""talk"" in telepathy to the horrid woman who transported into my bedroom years ago and viciously berated me.  So I spent yet another night making my nightly prayers followed by cursing out this horrid woman alien entity thing.  

As I am doing so my hand starts to redden, to burn and swell with those wretched little white bumps you get from allergic reactions.  It wasn't a bad burn, just very annoying and I had the feeling, I may be wrong but I did have the feeling, it was *them* again because of the timing.  Trying to control me once again, trying to punish.  Now this would be exceedingly minor if it were one of their ""punishments.""  I have been brutalized with a saw and other medical instruments by the mysterious entities so I do know what they're capable of.  5+ years later and I still remember the pain in excruciating detail.  Pain that stretched into the infinite and deeply damaged my psyche.
It's interesting when you research into the Targeted Individuals community, and I do all the time because it's the same sh-t that happens to me, so many people are saying this : *they burn me with a laser beam* or *they're making me sick* or how about *I'm getting v2k transmissions* (voice to skull auditory).

It's enough people saying it- some say it's people behind it, some say UFOs, some say FBI/CIA, some say supernatural.  But it's enough people by this point, that for all sensible people it is time to cross that threshold and say I'm not crazy, you're not crazy, something with intelligence is attacking us.  I've got a good head on my shoulders and all of you here, I know you do too, we are thinking people.  We are reasoning people who aren't limited in our thinking by what the status quo tells us is and is not possible.  The status quo brought us here, to a place of being *unprepared*, facing onslaughts of bizarre phenomena alone and threatened with every kind of sanction and ridicule if we dare admit something out of the ordinary happened.

It's weird, I spent the last few years so terrorized that they'd come back.  Keeping all my limbs tightly within the confines of my bed, terrified of being grabbed again in the night.  Like the sailor lost at sea on a life raft who carefully tucks in every limb as they float over shark infested waters knowing a stupid flimsy plastic raft is nothing, but clinging to it as if it could save you.  That is what my bed became to me.  

But I want them back now, because maybe I am getting stronger, maybe all the wrath has made me lose part of my fear and become more accepting of the prospect of death.   When the came to me I lost a whole lot, I lost so much hope but I was given one thing: information.  I saw for myself that these things are out there, felt their energy, experienced how they interact.  It was as much fun as being attacked by a pack of hyenas and the Max that emerged from those interactions is a maimed, traumatized, world weary Max.  But I saw things, I heard things, I learned about telepathy and the hive mind.  I learned that something in me is stronger than them, something in me that surprised them.  

Maybe I will find a way to be something other than the floating piece of meat they have known.  Nobody knows how to fight these things.  Nobody knows who they are, what they are.  Well it's time we figured that out mates, I don't know how but the clock is ticking, and somethings gotta give. I want to know what I'm up against.  

It is time that they come to fear *me.*  If they ever come back, I am ready now and I am a force to be reckoned with.

Was i actually abducted or is it just a vivid dream?,"So approximately 1 year ago, i used to have these weird dreams. one of nights, i felt like someone touched me. i ignored it. another night i felt like someone just grabbed my head from top and called my name. i dismissed all of them as a case of sleep paralysis and a side effect of my smoking a little too much marijauna.  
but one particular night, i literally felt very awake. i have no idea what time it began, but i know it end around 4-5 am something. i suddenly woke up and saw someone .. but felt a weird kind of force that kind of pulled me towards my room outing and out of my bed. i saw a slight shadowy figure around the corner for a second. it was only for a very split second. the only thing i remember next is floating above my washing machine which is outside my room by in a very ""light feeling"" as if levitating. there was a very red light everywhere.

the only thing i remember is mild sunlight and me being back in my bed and feeling relatively calm.

PS... i felt myself floating as if, but also saw myself levitating in third person (in a red kind of light), but everything else was first person. it felt SO REAL.

Now i have had many sleep paralysis and lucid dreams.. i have them everyday and so much that they are actually very normal for me and welcomed always. but idk what happened that night. it was a very scary experience and i never felt anything like it before. nothing at all.

To help my case, i am attaching an image. its a hand drawn sketch of my room at that time with some locations in black pen. **black lines are solid walls that define my room.** here is what they mean **in terms of the numbers** they hold:

1.) the place where i felt two hands hold my head, as if ""embracing"" it and calling out my name. it was a terrible feeling.

2.) the place where i felt something grabbing me while i was faced towards the wall (blue lines are either walls or some kind of hard surface).

3.) the place where i saw a shadowy figure for a split second.

4.) my washing machine (just outside the room), above which i felt like i was levitating immersed in a sort of very red light.

here are some of the questions that i might get - with their answers:

1.) how old? -> 24 now, 22-23 then

2.) drug past? --> no. only weed and alcohol. nothing else at all.

3.) religious? -> yes.

4.) did it ever happen again? -> no never. only once and that was it.

5.) any marks on body -> no. none i could find (i looked for them after the incident, since i am a big interested guy into paranormal and especially aliens and stuff).

Please help. ask me anything u want to in DMs. i will reply almost immediately, please help me figure out - was it just very lucid dreaming or something real?

Strange Happenings,"This is my first reddit post and it is long, so bear with me, yall. I've been with my husband for going on 5 years this year, and im pretty sure hes an abductee. I want to see if other people experience the same thing. First, hes had this scar on his back since I've known him, and had no recollection of getting it, its almost as if someone took a hot metal tube and burned an impression into him. Its no bigger than a pencil eraser, and almost in the dead center of his back, slightly higher than the middle(pic in comments if i can figure out how that works). Every 3-4 months he and I will have a small period of time, about a week, where we cant shake the feeling that something is watching us. We will have very vivid dreams and always wake up on the hour around 2-3 am. The night of the full lunar eclipse (1/20/19) he asked me to check his back because something was sore. I felt around and nothing looked wrong but when ii felt his scar he said it hurt. It was alot more pronounced than usual, like it was swollen. We went to bed that night, and around 2 am, I woke up from a dead sleep and felt scared. I turned to my husband and there was a humanoid figure looming over him. But the second I saw him, its almost as if I fell back into a trance and I woke up that morning with no recollection of dreams or anything else besides what I saw. Since then his scar has gone back to normal and i haven't seen anything. Has anyone else experienced this??",0

LSD and possible abduction? Opinions,"This was a few years ago. I was with my girlfriend at the time and her older brother and we decided to take some LSD. Now, it definitely wasn’t my first time. This time however was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.. it was like I was in a different world. It was horrifying. The fear is indescribable. I remember at one point “waking up” on a table surrounded by either scientists or aliens or beings. I’m not 100% sure as they were pretty blurry. There was about 6 of them surrounding me and I remember saying to “stop it and leave me alone” that’s when I heard “we will never leave you alone. This will go on forever”. I started to blackout after that. I remember them also saying that I had to think that no one would ever help me in life. That I had to do it all alone. God it was terrible. It was like my entire conscious was hijacked. Like my body’s lights were on but no one was home. It felt so real. Does anyone have any ideas on what this was? Sorry if I didn’t give the best description. After that I’ve had episodes where I black out and try walking through walls, and similar things happen. They happen somewhat frequently and neither therapists nor doctors have a real explanation.",0
"Not sure what to make of an experience last night, and looking for some guidance.","I had an experience last night I am having a hard time wrapping my head around. I don’t want to talk to any of my family or friends about it because I don’t want them to worry about me/my mental health, but it has stuck with me all day and I would really like to share it with someone and hear if anyone has had similar experiences. 

Full disclosure, I have had occasional sleep paralysis since I was a teen, but this was very different in a lot of ways: 

1) I woke up in the middle of the night and realized something was “off”. I sat up, put on my glasses, and reached for my phone (flashlight). Next thing I know, I was laying down and my glasses were back on the table. I tried twice, after the second time I guess I blacked out. 

2) What comes next is sort of confusing. I’m tempted to call it a dream, but it’s not like any dream I’ve ever had. All there was was darkness, and the sound of my own voice begging: “I want to go home. Please just let me go home.” I could hear myself saying the words, but I couldn’t feel words coming out of my mouth, nor did I know why I was saying them. I just knew that it was my voice, and I sounded scared. I didn’t see anything but eyes once, right in my face, but all fuzzy and out of focus. And, I know this will sound odd, but sometimes there was music. Just dark and music and the feeling of being watched. 

3) I remember two sensations. One was pain, it was a feeling like someone cutting from just below my naval, down in a straight line. It was the most sharp and real pain I have ever felt. And then I felt like I was floating in thick liquid, and I kept panicking because I was worried I couldn’t breath, but I could. 

This morning, I woke up like normal and went to work. It’s hard to explain, I’m so incredibly shook, yet I feel oddly calm about it too. Part of me believes it was nothing but a weird dream. Another part feels like, whatever it was, at least it’s behind me. 

What’s really odd is the detachment I felt the whole time. Listening to myself beg to go home, hearing the fear in my own voice, I felt scared *for* myself, but not actual fear. It almost feels like I watched something horrible happen to someone else, and all I can remember is the sound of their voice. Only, it’s my voice and I sounded more scared than I have ever felt in my life. ",0

Memory loss and strange markings on my genitals after losing my virginity,"Since I was little, I've been having problems with memory loss and similar nightmares, but never had physical proof of an abduction. Recently, I moved away from my parents house, and it went better  for a while. But it returned yesterday when I lost my virginity. I had the worst nightmare in a dark room with strange lightings and strong pain in my abdomen, tubes in all my orifices, and woke up with a strange scar in my testicles.

My girlfriend was with me the whole night, and she didn't see anything. Which is strange because we both suffer from insomnia, and we both fell asleep before taking our medication while talking.

Notes: I don't know if any of that is relevant, but she was also a virgin, and I lived in a UFO sightings area here in Brasil. I will post the link to a pic of the scar in the comments, but I will reread the rules first to be sure I can do that.

The scars are 7 round circles, six of them forming a perfect rectangular shape.

Se slept with the AC on and the windows closed, but when we woke up, the windows were open.

Also, English is not my first language so please be patient.

"Strange, Wide-awake, experience two nights ago","Two days ago started like any normal day for me.  I was up at 4am and started my day.  I noticed I had a lot more energy than I've had in a long time.  Almost like I had drank a cooler full of Red Bulls, but without the jitters or anxiety of caffeine and other energy drinks.  At the time I chalked this up to my mood, as it has improved beyond belief since my experience 3 weeks ago.  I've even started working out again, to get rid of the weight I've gained over the last few years.  I haven't felt this happy and normal in a long time.

At the end of the day, I relaxed for a bit and played some KSP.  When bedtime came around I found myself staring at the ceiling unable to sleep.  I tried every method I knew to try and fall asleep.  I counted backwards by threes, counted sheep, meditation and just about anything else.  I contemplated taking some melatonin but by then it was so late in the evening that it would do more harm than good, since it knocks me out for a good 12 hours even at it's weakest dose.  I finally gave up and decided to watch a few of my favorite streamers for a bit.    

Around midnight I decided to try and get back to sleep so I went and laid back down with my wife.  I stared at the ceiling some more until I heard a weird sound.  It sounded like two deep toned rhythm sticks hitting each other, kind of a deep click clack sound.  I sat up and saw three creatures standing at the foot of my bed.  One was a Mantis though he was trying to hide it.  I could see through what he was wanting me to see, almost like looking through thin gauze, but could see his triangular head and multifaceted eyes clearly.  The other two were the Tall One who's always been there for my experiences, and a shorter one who was obviously very shy and nervous, and hid behind the Tall One, just peeking out.  

This is where I've been wondering if my experience three weeks ago was actually just a recovered memory, because I am sure the small one was the child that was presented to me in that experience, and she was much older this time.  About the size of a six year old.

I tried to wake up my wife but she wouldn't stir, so I tried to turn on my nightstand lamp to get a better look, but it wouldn't turn on either.  The mantis seemed a little annoyed that I was awake.  He pointed something towards me that looked like an old time TV remote, the kind that only had two push buttons on it.  I felt waves of sleep hitting me.  I would almost close my eyes to go to sleep, and then suddenly feel fully awake again.  Finally the mantis got annoyed, if his clicking was anything to judge it by and faded back into the shadows around the wall.  The Tall One seemed quite amused by what had happened, I also noticed that the child had left.  

When I asked him what happened to the child, he said she was curious about my children and went to look at them.  While we were waiting for her to come back he told me that he was glad that I had ""finally remembered how to be happy"".  I don't know if what he did next was either a deliberate or if I had somehow penetrated his screen for a brief instant, but I could see his face, which I have never seen since I began having experiences 27 years ago.  I've been trying to draw it, I can see it clearly in my mind, but I've never been very good at drawing what I see.  His skin was a greenish-grey and I'm almost certain he is a hybrid mantis, as his head was more elongated than triangular.  Slightly above the mouth were angular lines that reminded me of the mandibles of an insect, but tucked in close to the skin.  There were also semi-circular raised areas around the  left and right side of the mouth, the mouth was small, almost circular, with slight lips around it.    His eyes were and inverted teardrop shape, and were black, but very irridescent.  They  were not multifaceted like the mantid's eyes were.

Once the child came back into the room, I could tell she was still nervous about me.  Every time I met her eyes she would hide her face in the Tall One's robes.  I decided to lay back down and face towards my wife while I thought about how much I loved her and how happy I was to see her.  I tried to make sure I thought this very strongly so she might pick it up.  I jumped a little when I felt her touch my arm.  It sent tingles all over my body.  I had to focus on my breathing for a moment because my excitement was so great I felt like I was about to hyperventilate. I felt her trace the tattoo I have on my upper arm, and while she was doing this, it was almost as if I could feel what she was thinking.  I felt her nervousness that I wouldn't like her or accept her, so I made sure to redouble my efforts to push out a feeling of love and acceptance for her.  As her touch pulled away, I turned slowly over so I could see her, she was as beautiful as I remembered, her arms moved gracefully, as did her fingers, which were quite long.  As I was looking at he she just faded into the wall like the mantid did.  When I sat up and looked at the foot of my bed, the Tall One was still there.  He told me that I had done well and then he faded upwards towards the ceiling.  

I know this was not a dream as I never fell asleep at all that night, I was just too full of energy.  After they had left I went back into the living room and worked out for a bit, and then began editing a video I had been putting on the back burner for quite awhile.  I've finally broken down and told my wife about my experiences.  She reacted exactly as I figured she would.  She didn't say I was crazy or anything, but she just says she believes that I believe I experienced something.

I just feel so bad that every time I have an experience, I never ask their names.  It's almost like it doesn't need to be said, as if I know them so well that names don't matter.

Alien in my room,"I remember being paralyzed in bed my head facing the door to my room when an alien that sort of looked like a grey came in. It had some bone looking structure around its neck which looked like it was keeping its head up. It had a disgruntled face and vibe to it, and judging by the door it must've been around five feet tall.

I've had very vague flashes of being abducted before, but still remain a very skeptical person in general.",0
My experience: strange visitation in bedroom on 12/12/18,"My husband and I live in a 1 bedroom apartment in the 4th and top floor of our building with 2 dogs. Last week I woke up to the sound of the sliding glass door in our living room being slammed shut. I immediately sat up to see what was going on. Before I could get out of the bed I saw the silhouettes of 3 people with silver almond shaped eyes imposed over the silhouette in the center which was a bit taller than the other 2. I’m not sure if my eyes were closed, but this took up my whole field of vision.  I hear a voice in my head that says “Be calm, be calm, be calm.” It worked, I felt calmer and and I laid back down. I looked down to the small hallway at the foot of our bed that connects to the bathroom and I see 2 little people about 3-4 feet tall, a man and a woman I’d guess, but their features weren’t those of a fully developed adult. They were completely naked with whitish grey skin and had no genitals, they also didn’t have ears with only holes for hearing. The more male looking of the 2 was bald, the one I’d describe as female had shoulder length white hair. Her appearance almost seems like someone trying to dress up as a human but not getting the details quite right. They stared at me for a moment that felt like eternity before they ran down the hall to our living room. My husband was asleep in bed next to me oblivious and our dogs were asleep on the floor. 

   I got up and ran into the living room. No one was in the apartment. I went out onto the balcony and saw the little man’s head poking out our bedroom window looking at me. Naturally I ran back to the bedroom. No one was there except my sleeping husband and pets. I looked out the window and saw the little woman standing out on our balcony, still stark naked. I tried to yell “Hey!” To get her attention but my mouth was so dry from the anxiety of the situation that I couldn’t get the words out so I just waved instead. She waved back and her body language visibly relaxed. I went back to the living room and recall seeing them both standing together. I don’t know what kind of interaction we may have had after that. 

The next thing I knew I was back in bed and it sounded like there was an enormous wind storm outside that only lasted maybe a minute tops. I went back to sleep and woke up in the morning shaking. I told my husband what had happened and he said it must have been a dream as he knows I’m prone to very vivid dreams. This did not feel like a dream, it felt hyper real and extremely realistic and lucid. There was no strange dream logic and our apartment appeared exactly identical to how it did this morning. Usually when I dream about things happening in our apartment the layout is changed or the furniture is different. This was not the case.  I’ve had some anxiety about potentially seeing them again and some trouble sleeping. That’s getting better with time though. Today I recalled a brief vague memory of seeing the female looking creature in my bathroom with a large syringe. I feel like it is likely I will see them again, although I’m not sure why. It just feels like I have unfinished business with them.

My abduction experiences.,"This is my first time ever telling anyone other than my father at the time it happened, and my oldest son (11 at the time, who I told of my experience after he had almost the exact same experience except he was told to tell me about his) about my experiences, and will include what happened to me on Saturday night.

One night, in the winter of 1991 I am positive that I was abducted for the first time from my bed by extraterrestrials.  I remember waking up on a cold metal bed, naked and unrestrained, and seeing something moving in the shadows of the room I was in.  I don't know exactly what I saw, but it made me uneasy.  I got up from the bed and fled into a long hall.  Other rooms attached to this hall, and all had the same metal bed.  I don't remember seeing anyone in these other rooms, or what was in my room other than shadows moving.  I followed the hall to a large, brightly lit room.  There were several people in the room.  Tall and wearing brown and beige robes.  I turned to run the other way but ran right into another robed person who picked me up.  The next thing I remember is laying in my bed, in my room.  The robed person who had picked me up was in the corner and when he saw I was awake he leaned over me and placed something in front of my eyes.  There was a bright white flash and I was able to move and he was gone.  

Obviously on the surface of this, it seems like a generic nightmare with a night terror at the end, and that is what my father told me it was, but I've never believed it.  It didn't terrify me, I just felt uneasy because I was in a strange place with strange people, but never felt like these people meant me harm.  Since this experience I have been positive there are other beings in our universe, but I've never told anyone about what happened to me, nor have I ever before now sought out a place to talk about it or do any research since almost every abduction experience I have been exposed to in national media seems to involve the grey men and are frightening experiences which mine never were, so to be honest I discounted most of those kinds of experiences as being driven by the mainstream media.

In the years that have passed I have had several dreams a year where I was with these same people again, and I've never been sure if they were actual experiences or just dreams.  The tall people in brown robes have never spoken to me, though I know what they are saying, if that makes sense.  I have spoken vocally with other people who were with us and everyone seemed calm and friendly, almost like it was a gathering of friends.  I've often wondered if these dreams were abduction experiences, were these other abductees as they did not have the otherworldliness that the tall ones in the robes do.  I have never been given any messages to relate, or told anything about what is happening or anything at all like that.  It's always just been as if I was there as a passive observer or even a companion of the people in the robes. 

This has always been the pattern of the dreams until last Saturday night.  That night I was in a brightly lit room.  It seemed to be an extremely long rectangle, wider than it was long.  I was seated on square chair with no back and to my left was an area divided from the rest of the room with what seemed to be frosted glass.  I was presented with an infant that I was told was my daughter.  When I looked at her I felt a surge of emotion and love that I have NEVER felt in my life, even when I held my own sons, or married my wife.  It shames me to say that about my own family, but it is true that what I felt in this dream was so much more intense than what I feel for them.  She had dark brown hair that had a bit of curl to it.  He skin was a dark golden brown and her eyes were beautiful. Gold and shaped like large almonds. On her forehead was a spiral pattern of dark skin. I was/am so happy to have her as a daughter.  

I asked about her mother, and the nurse beside me kind of looked off to my right.  I saw in the distance a tall robed man standing beside another in robes watching me, I knew she was the mother.  She was shorter and more petite than the others in the robes and her skin was a very dark black.  When I saw her I also felt the same surge of emotion and love that I felt for the baby.  So much more intense than anything I've ever felt for a woman, even my wife, who is the only woman I have ever felt Eros for.   

The nurse took the baby from me and I stood up and walked with a robed man who always seemed to be beside me in these dreams.  I of course babbled incessantly about my daughter and how proud I was, and how excited my wife would be to meet her.  I also referred to the baby's mother as my wife as for some reason that's what I felt she was, and I was convinced she felt the same way.  

 Later I began to feel agitated and wanted to see my wife and child again.  I kept being told that I would see them soon and not to worry but I continued to get more and more agitated.  Finally I was told that a rule had been broken and that I must return home, but they would see me again.

I woke up and turned to wake my wife up to tell her about my daughter when I realized it was a dream/abduction experience, and she wouldn't understand.

I have thought of nothing else but my daughter and her mother for the last two days.  It's weird, but it's what prompted me to write this, to see if any others have had a similar experience to mine and maybe be pointed toward something that might help me understand

Wanted: Update on Armando Valdes abduction case,"April 25 1977 - Chile - Platoon leader Cpl. Armando Valdes dissapears in front of his men's eyes after a UFO approaches his group. 15 minutes later he appears with several days of beard growth and a watch that reads 5 days later.

April 25 2002 - In an interview he says he wasn't abducted in the traditional sense of the word, he was not taken aboard a ship or anything, but said that during the experience he could see and hear his men the whole time, but would not elaborate any further, and said it would all be in a future book called The Shadow of Truth coming out later in the year, and the whole experience relates somehow to ""eschatology"" 

September 26 2003 - Again in an interview, he admits that he wasn't actually abducted, but the truth was actually more difficult to explain, more paranormal, but the beard growth and watch details were still correct. He then said that he's going to write a book explaining everything which was coming soon.

Today: I cannot find this book anywhere online, if it was ever published. So what do you think actually happened to Armando?",0
Possible close encounter?,"I had come home from an outing with my friends, we had been smoking pot for almost the whole time. By the time I got home, it had already worn off and I was understandably tired. I laid down on my bed and got comfortable. I dont remember drifting off, but i guess i fell asleep because I had what I thought at the time to be a dream. I ""woke up"" in a strange location, feeling like i was floating. I started to be able to make out my surroundings. I saw blue-grey metallic looking walls with no ceiling, where I could see a lot of stars. (I live in an area where the stars are very visible at night and these didnt look like the stars I see at night.) I saw a large alien with the stereotypical features standing over me woth what looked to be a collar like one you'd see on a king. I suddenly felt extremely calm and relaxed looking into his eyes, and I drifted off again. When I woke up, I was laying on the floor of my living room, when I checked the time it was 4:30 pm the next day. (I got home around 5:00 pm the prior day.) When i woke up it took me a good 30 minutes to remember where I was and what happened the day before.

This happened a couple months ago, and recently ive noticed that the left side of all earbuds ive used have stopped working. Is it possible these are related? Previously I've had no issues with earbuds.",0
After 1966 alien abductor revisits after 54 years?,"In 1966 My girlfriend and I were abducted after seeing a “full moon” fly over our car. We drove on another 5 minutes after seeing it then we pulled over and slept. Woke up in the car in a different location about 5 to 10 miles away. On arriving back we discovered that we had lost 2 to 3 hours approx with no memory of what had happened.
This year a tall dark-skinned alien floated into my bedroom.  I could see him - - but I couldn’t - weird! He produced a Dull metal cylinder which squeaked, groaned and throbbed, which he thrust at me, sinking in to my body for a few seconds. His friendly-silent voice, told me “not to worry about my health”  - (Prostate cancer) and floated through the wall. I was left with a strong impression of friendship and that he knew me. ",0
Possible Abductions in Cincinnati,"There's some weird stuff going on in Cincinnati... About a week ago, on November 21, a local news station posted a really vague article to their Facebook page about a search at East Fork Lake by the State Highway Patrol because the Air Force contacted them about some signal they detected, but they found nothing. Here is the link [https://www.wlwt.com/article/what-were-officials-searching-for-at-east-fork-lake/25245584?fbclid=IwAR3INogzzWFw-p6orrXUk1as2LVl9pdKC3P5f-sZzrcskg0NrfzmoMgIpuU](https://www.wlwt.com/article/what-were-officials-searching-for-at-east-fork-lake/25245584?fbclid=IwAR3INogzzWFw-p6orrXUk1as2LVl9pdKC3P5f-sZzrcskg0NrfzmoMgIpuU). As I said - super vague. It's the Facebook comments on the post that say way more. A couple people mention seeing and hearing a jet going down. A man named Eddie Wichman has the best comment - he said he saw the jet at only 1,000-2,000 feet and he thought it was going to crash soon. He said he saw other people posting about it on Facebook too so he decided to call State Highway Patrol who told him about the Air Force's detected signal, which was from an aircraft emergency beacon, but it had suddenly disappeared. Here the link to the Facebook post if you would like to look at it [https://www.facebook.com/wlwt5/posts/10155605985646852](https://www.facebook.com/wlwt5/posts/10155605985646852). 

ANYWAY, here is where it gets interesting. Today I saw an article from November 26 saying ""Another search in East Fork Lake: Hunter disappears in woods"" ([https://www.wlwt.com/article/another-search-in-east-fork-lake-area-hunter-disappears-in-woods/25312516](https://www.wlwt.com/article/another-search-in-east-fork-lake-area-hunter-disappears-in-woods/25312516)). so I read it and then read the Facebook comments. I hadn't even made the connection about that being the location of the weird jet incident, but people in the comments sure did. Notice how the word ""another"" is in there - upon reading the article I discovered another person had already gone missing after his boat overturned a day earlier. Here's the article about that incident ([https://www.wlwt.com/article/officials-loveland-dive-team-dispatched-to-east-fork-lake/25300626](https://www.wlwt.com/article/officials-loveland-dive-team-dispatched-to-east-fork-lake/25300626)). 

These individuals have not yet been found. What are all your thoughts? Do you think they may be abductions? It all just seems very weird to me.",0

Possible Abduction?," 

In all my years of scouring the internet, I've never come across another person who has experienced something like this, besides of course the friend of mine who I was with at the time. I posted this story to another sub-reddit about a year ago, but it didn't get much traction, I'm hoping to broaden the circle by posting it here.

So, about 4 years ago, I was at one of my best friend's house spending the night. She and I were sitting on her bed, with our faces in electronics, as most 12-year-old kids do. My friend lived full-time with her grandparents, and both she and I remember her grandmother coming in and telling us to get to bed soon, as it was 11:30. Neither of us planned on listening, as summer break had just started, but I did look at her alarm clock to confirm that it was indeed 11:30 at night. She and I continued to play on our electronics, mostly in silence because of her grandmother previously telling us to get to bed. She played minecraft on her phone as I played on of those geeky dating-sims on her DS.

This is where the glitch happens. I played a full route of the game with no bathroom or snack breaks. It only felt like an hour or so, and given my lack of needed to attend to myself, that's pretty understandable. My friend didn't get up to really do anything either. If my memory serves me right, she and I both barely moved. After getting done with a full route of the game, I asked my friend what time it was. I figured it was about 1 in the morning. My friend exited her app, and looked at the time. I remember seeing her eyes widen and she looked at me and told me in disbelief that it was 5:36 am. I laughed it off, but when I turned my head to look at her alarm clock, it too said '5:36 am'.

Since this, I have played that same DS taking the exact same route in the game, same copy and everything, while timing myself and it only took me 1 hour and 15 minutes exactly. I've never told anyone of this story before, and neither has my friend but we've both been pretty baffled for the last 4 years as to what happened that night. Almost every logical explanation can be ruled out, (Daylight saving only jumps ahead 1 hour, and this was like 4, I'm certain neither of us fell asleep without noticing, etc, etc). The only explanation that has ever stuck out to me was a possible alien abduction.   
I don't know how common a 'double' abduction may be, but what my friend and I have since come up with is the possibility of us being abducted, our memories being wiped, and then being put back in our exact places. This would make up for the lost time. Another possibility is that just one of us was abducted, with the other having their memory of witnessing the abduction wiped as well. I've posted this on two other sub-reddits, (mostly ones about unexplained experiences) but I thought this time I'd try and specialize it. ",0
Has anyone ever attempted an Alien Aubduction ambush/sting operation?,"For anyone here who has studied the abduction phenomena, you will know that there are abductees who report being taken at regular intervals, Usually at a frequency on once every few weeks or so. This got me thinking, what if somebody where to hide somewhere close to abductee in question's house during the night and look for signs of aliens arriving to take the abductee? Potentially the Abductee could give the team an idea of what interval they are taken at.

If detected then they could zero in and interviene, confronting the aliens directly with tac-gear and heavily sheilded cameras and sensors (sheilding would be needed for the em fields the aliens use to mess with electronics) to finally prove the abduction phenomena is real.

If there was adequite funding I could potentially see there being a team of people large enough to block the Aliens ability to telepathically anesthetize the human body (due to overwhealming numbers, maybe 10-15 people) and there might even be potential to capture the alien beings by force and detain them. Has anyone ever had this idea or attempted to do anything similar to this?

"Generational Encounters with the Paranormal, UFOs and The Men In Black","Been a conspiracy nut-ball for over a decade now. The past 6 months or more I’ve been looking into alien abductions pretty heavy. It was a corner of the conspiracy world that I hadn’t really devoted a lot of time to yet. And as I started looking into it I thought wouldn’t it be funny if I started to suspect I’m an abductee just as side effect of spending a lot of time on these topics.

Well. I don’t suspect I’m an abductee but there is definitely something going on with my family. While I was looking into alien stuff I recalled my mom saying she once saw a ufo. So I was up visiting my family recently and asked her about it. She saw it in the late 70s or early 80s – I forgot to ask the exact year. Either right before I was born, while she was pregnant with me or right after I was born. At the time my folks lived in a country farm house out in the middle of nowhere Illinois. Dad was away on work. It was about 9pm and mom realized she had forgot to feed the dogs. She went outside, fed the dogs and looked up to see a massive black triangle ufo with 3 red lights (one at the point of each triangle angle). It wasn’t too far above the house. Made no noise. She said she stood in shock from seeing a ufo but even more so how massive it was. And that’s that. I believe she said it just slowly hovered away over the tree line and she went back in the house. I’ll have to ask her if the dogs ate like normal or if they were freaked out? See if she remembers that detail.

Also I recalled my mom and little sister joking about my little sister seeing “alans”. I asked them what they were talking about and they said when my little sister was 3 years old – several times she would leave her bedroom in the middle of the night and go into my mom’s bedroom.  Wake my mom up and ask to sleep with her because there were alans in my little sister’s room. Alans were what my 3 year old little sister called aliens. I thought it was interesting and worth mentioning.

On one of my trips up to visit my family a buddy and I were visiting with my dad. My buddy say’s to my dad that he actually knows some people who do paranormal investigating in the area where my dad lives. My dad said hey that’s interesting and wanting to hear more about it. Which I thought was weird, I never thought of my dad to be interested in the paranormal. While they were discussing this I spoke up and said, “Ya know if you actually experience the paranormal – ya don’t go looking for it.” Side note: I’ve had an ass ton of paranormal stuff happen to me but I’ve never discussed it with my dad because like I said I never took him for somebody who’d be open minded to it. My dad looked at me and said, “Huh, I’ve had one paranormal thing happen to me.” And he told us the following story. Starts off my dad is in the hospital and he’s dying. Side note: My dad has cheated death more than any other human I’ve ever met. For him to start off a story stating I was in the hospital dying is just par for the course. He said, Boys I was dying I was on my way out and there was no doubt about that. I had accepted my fate and the light in the room started fading out and a darkness started faded in. Just then two men in black suits and hats came in the room. They said, “Mr. Jones I’m afraid we cannot allow you to die at this time.” Then they walked back out of the room. My dad miraculously came back to life. A doctor and nurse came running in and said something to the effect of Mr. Jones you’re okay! You look amazing! We were not thinking you were going to make it. My dad asked who were the men in the black suits and hats? The doctor stated that he and the nurse had been right outside my dad’s room at the nurses station for some time and no-one had been in or out.

One of my earliest paranormal experiences is me and a friend seeing a 1950’s men-in-black style Cadillac disappear right in front of us. Also a year or two after that I was followed home one night by a mob of shadow people wearing suits, hats and trenchcoats – much like the men in black and or the shadow apparition known as the hat man.

Dr. David Jacobs an expert in ufology and abductions believes this phenomena to be generational. And that the paranormal and aliens are basically one in the same. Say your grandparents were abductees. Then it might skip a generation to where nothing at all happens to their kids. And then perhaps just one of the grandchildren experience paranormal activity. And the cycle repeats in ways somewhat similar to that example. Which I agree with that theory. Not that it’s an explanation for everything weird and paranormal but I do believe in some peoples cases the generational thing applies.

TL;DR: My family and I seem to have ties to the paranormal, aliens and the men in black.

Red diamonds with dots please help,"As a child we stopped at a sleazy hotel in Atlanta Georgia in the middle of nowhere. I was about 9 years old.
All I recall is waking up with a sort of jolting conscienceness I have never felt after sleep. I got up to use the restroom and noticed markings on my arms. Looking into the mirror after exiting the bathroom I was pretty shocked. 
Red geometrical patterns traced my body. 
Very symmetrical with each other, I had red diamonds wrapping my arms covering my torso and onto my face.
No one believes me to this day but I have heard one similar story. It was about another young girl who had the same markings after being found in the fields at night yards from her home. She spoke of space and the ship she was aboard according to the teller.
I just need to know if anyone has ever experienced anything similar. 
Red diamonds, they are in a pattern from decreasing to increasing size. Maybe 5 before the pattern restarted. And from my memory I recall a red dot above and below the diamonds.
I can not find anything similar on line and I am reaching out to the Reddit community for help. 
For the record I am now 23 years old. And was traveling during the incident and have no recollection of where in GA I was.",0
"Hi, I’m from Tennessee, this is my first post. Help me understand","I don’t know if I was abducted, I may have just been visited. I lie in bed, sleeping. When suddenly I’m jolted awake by disembodied voices, maybe like 10. When I open my eyes, my sight was like tv static, I don’t know how else to describe it. Suddenly a grey/green alien with black eyes grabs my eyebrows and leans over to look at me. He looked at me for a few seconds, and I can’t remember anything else. You can’t tell me this was sleep paralysis, I’ve struggled with that in the past. This was a visitation from aliens. This took place maybe a month ago. Why me?

Possible abduction?,"I had an expierence around a year ago, and I’ve just brushed it off as a horrible case of first time sleep paralysis, but the more I think about it, the more suspicious I get.

So I woke up in a state of shock(Like from a nightmare minus the nightmare) and I was totally paralysed from head to toe.  I was laying on my back, slightly leaning on my side. I couldn’t even move my eyes, but they were pinned to the hallway(I live in a studio apartment so I have a clear view into the hallway from my bed).

The room was drenched in a grey light(I’m guessing this was around 3-4am based on everything around me), and that’s not normal at all. It’s usually totally black with maybe a little orange hue from the lights outside. My heart was beating really hard, but not extremely fast, and I was drenched in sweat.

In the hallway I see a tall dark figure staring right at me. I couldn’t make out any details, except that it was tall(2-2,5 meters based on the height of our ceiling) I would say it was totally black, but since the hallway was dark I really don’t know. 

I laid there with my eyes glued to it, it staring back at me, for what felt like an eternity, but realistically I’d say it lasted around a minute before I finally managed to tear my eyes away from it and I flung over to my other side and embraced my boyfriend. At the exact moment I gained control the tears just started pouring from my face, and I was shaking with confusion and fear. I didn’t have the guts(or heart) to look into the hallway again, but after laying there for a few minutes I started thinking and looking around(we have a bookcase at the foot of our bed so you can’t see the hallway from where my boyfriend is laying) and the grey, strange light was still there. The whole atmosphere was dark and heavy, and it almost felt like I was in another dimension if that makes sense. Everything looked like it had a black and white filter over it, and it almost seemed foggy.  I managed to fall asleep because of exhaustion after awhile, and when I woke up a few hours later to go to school, the apartment STILL had that eerie feeling, and I still felt incredibly scared and vulnerable. 

I’ve always had trouble sleeping, but after this it got so much worse. Not even because I’m scared or not tired or anything, but I’ll seriously lay in bed with my eyes closed for 5-6 hours without being able to fall asleep. 

I’m not sure what else to say. i don’t even know if it was an abduction, but it seems weird to me that the atmosphere was still like that if I was dreaming? If you have any questions or I failed to include something feel free to ask!

anyone have a similar memory?,so this is something i kept to myself for a long time but it is a very vivid memory and feel like this could be something more then a delusion and that it might possibly of happened.  before i start i want to say that parts of this is hazy but i will try to keep to only what i can attest to being what i actually remember.    so starting out i was around 14-15.  didn't have much of a life at all outside of my family. they where pretty restrictive and didn't have any friends.  most nights we would be inside and id be in my room playing on a ps2.  but some nights me and my mom and dad and sister would sit on the porch in the back of our yard and watch a camp fire and talk.  id usually look in the yard for wood as they talked and walk down a path in the woods to a old tree house. but the night that im about to discuss went different.  so my sister was sitting next to the fire and my parents sat more near to the back door. i sit next to the fire opposite of my sister and the fire is about to go out and all you really see is the  embers still burning.  at this point im starting to look up at the night sky. it was a really nice night and you could see all the stars. no overcast or anything.  it had to be around 10-11 pm  that this happened but i remember as i looked up at the stars this thing. this object i can only describe as being fully black except for 3 circular orbs that where the same white as the stars i was looking at making a triangle formation flew from the woods to the other side of the house  it looked like it was just a few feet above the treeline and looked like it was almost the size of our house. i could tell this wasn't just three lights tho because as it went over the house it obstructed the view of the stars while also making a light hum. once it goes over the house i hear my dad say what was that. and a few seconds later the thing comes back right to where my dad was. this time it was faster but stopped suddenly  right above him and the humming stopped. the next thing i new this light emitted from one of the orbs and illuminated my dad. my mom screams and then a light is shown on her. i get up and start running along with my sister who is in front of me at this point screaming louder then y mom as she ran away from the house and this thing.  im almost caught up to her as a light hits her as well and she stops dead and drops to the ground.  i turn to the right and head towards the front of the house to the road. i then see a light coming from the woods across the road i turn right again towards this bush and tree we have in the front yard. a this point im starting to pant and then right as im halfway between the bush and the house a white light hits me. i feel weaker as im bathed in the light. like gravity or something got heavy. i fall and then everything goes black. i felt like i was still trying to run as i was on the ground and then that's all i remember from that night.  now iv'e always thought of this as a nightmare or night terror but i recall the next day. at least that morning. i remember waking up outside the side of my face to the dirt  and drooling. i shiver and kept up and walk inside the front door. it was around 6 or 7 pm and i just get into bed and sleep for a few more hours. i wake up around mid afternoon and recall the night. at this point i was a little freaked out because it was so vivid. but i had vivid dreams before and thought that it was just a new one. but unlike my other vivid dreams. this one only happened once.  im 23 now and i feel like its tie to share this. when it happened i was in Georgia.  general location was bellow Athens if anyone feels like they might of seen something around this time or anything it could of possibly been.  i don't know if this was all a dream or real. but if anyone else had a memory of something like this maybe i can find out if it was more then a dream.   ,0

Old encounter with a strange creature,"I don’t have any memories of being abducted, but I don’t know where else to post alien related stuff. If anyone knows of any good subreddits for alien encounters, please let me know!

All my life I’ve had encounters with ufos and alien related stuff. The first time I remember seeing a ufo I was around 6-7, but no ones ever believed me. Of course I’ve gotten support from other believers, but none of them have taken it as seriously as I have. It doesn’t help that I’m scared shitless by aliens and all that stuff(so of course I’m more exposed to it than others lol).

But I wanted to ask about a specific encounter that I had when I was around 9-10 I think. My childhood years are really fused together age wise, so I’m not 100% sure but again I think I was around 9. I remember it super clearly, so I’m sure its not a made up memory. I have had many of those too, so I know the difference. I remember the fear I felt, the conversations I had, where I was, where I was going, who I was with, so it’s a totally clear memory.

I was with my Mom, her husband and my little sister. We were on vacation in northern norway because I have family on an island up there. We had rented an apartment by the water(by the docks i guess?)and behind the apartment building(two story) was a grassy hill that stretched far along the road from the house to the main road, approximately as tall as the house, covered inn tall grass and straw. One afternoon we got in the car to drive to the store, and I sat on the side that was faceing the grassy hill. 

We started driving, and like 10-20 meters from the house, on top of the grassy hill, stood a seemingly small creature. It was a beigey-grey colour, huuge black classic alien eyes, and this could be my head messing with me, but it looked like it had fur all over. The head was round, and the body also looked pretty rounded. Kind of like a snowman. I couldn’t make out any limbs, but as I said the hill was covered in tall grass, and of course I was in a moving car so I could’ve just missed it. It looked like it could have been around 1 meter tall. 

It was staring at me while we drove by and I was immiediately struck with a sense of fear and dread. I asked my mom if she saw it and if we could turn back but she didn’t believe me, and when we came back it was gone.

I want to add that my whole life I’ve felt like I was being watched. I’m very paranoid by nature, so I don’t know if thats a product of feeling watched, or vice versa. I also struggle with some mental health issues, but nothing related to hallucinations, plus those first came around age 12.

I don’t really know where I’m going with this, but I just want to share it with the community and maybe find someone who has seen the same creature. People I have shared this with always tells me that it was some sort of animal, but what fucking animals have they interacted with lol. I still get a sense of dread when I think about this, so I just want to hear what everyone else thinks about this encounter.

I could provide you with some sketches of the creature if my description is confusing, so just let me know.

i'm coming to you guys with this.,"my theories are very terrestrial by nature. i'm one of those ""jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams"", ""charlie manson was a subject of MKUltra"", ""more rain? dammit HAARP!"" type people... a regular jack off. i'm very skeptical but haven't ventured much out of the ordinary as far as conspiracy.

this occurred a year ago, and it still bothers me when i think about it.

anyways, a former-coworker learned this about me and he told me he was into ""way crazier shit"" than me. i told him, send me links, show me what you got, i'm game. i have the the day off, so i spend time watching these videos he sent me. subject matter includes: giants frozen in ice, angel genetics, the Hadron Collider being used to open demon portals... this shit is a bit too out there for me, little too wild... something that stood out to me was some videos he sent me about the moon; different theories about it not being a moon at all, but a hologram, or a space military base, etc. to me, that is not outside the realm of possibility. so i sit on it and think about it and inevitably become very paranoid and feel like i'm now on a list somewhere and shouldn't have watched the videos.

that night - not sure what time, but it was fully dark - i was trying to sleep but the moon was shining insanely bright the window. no matter where i moved on the bed or how i changed my line of sight, i swear to fuck, the moon would within seconds be back in front of my closed eyelids. i'm fighting this for a good half hour and then it happens again, i open my eyes, and the moon is c.l.o.s.e.r. to my w.i.n.d.o.w.... the next few times it occurs i swear it looked like it got unnaturally larger/closer every time. it made me so afraid that i ended up paralyzed with dread, and i couldn't stop thinking ""they know, they know that you know."" i don't remember what happened after. i don't remember falling asleep. i remember waking up in very early morning, but that's it, and i got blackout curtains the next day and started not thinking about it.

some of you seem to know about things of this nature. what's your take on this experience?


TLDR: moon seemed to be consciously ""following"" me, changing size/coming closer very rapidly. hoping it's just a paranoid hallucination.",0

Abductees what psychic experiences have you had?,"I started to think about the connection between psychic abilities and abductions when I read about a girl that was contacted by the entities after she used psychic abilities to find a missing crashed (plane, bus, something, can't remember).  She claimed the entities tracked and tested her to find the source of her psychic ability.

I recalled a psychic experience I had years before I had direct contact with the beings.  It was in school, my classmate.  Over time she started to radiate this energy that was overwhelming me.  It was an energy of death, I don't know how to describe it but it was an extremely powerful sad like presence whenever I was in the room with her.  She was a very intelligent and kind person.  But as several weeks went by the energy got stronger and I found it harder and harder to be near her due to the death energy emanating.

It was about a month after the energy started I saw my friend one last time.  Biology project in the basement library.  She was cheerful.  I wondered that she couldn't feel the sad energy like I did.

Couple days later I listened to the radio getting ready for bio class.  There was a car accident fatality in the rain.  I didn't draw the connection until I showed up at class, her desk was empty, I started to realize, then professor confirms it.  When I went home it hit me really hard, and I cried so hard but I didn't know why, as I hardly knew her.  

That premonition was my first strong psychic experience.  

I wonder now....if it's part of the reason I've been under attack by the beings.  ",0
Any other abductees remember feeling panic attacks when first exposed to pictures of greys?,"I know I was. I remember watching a documentary on the subject with extended family at my grandma's house when I was 11. I started having a panic attack because of the drawings and I remember standing outside while my relatives were telling me that it was okay, it wasn't real. My abduction experience (at least the one I can remember) was from when I was four.

For years afterward, I had trouble looking at anything with any depictions of greys. I had to really build up my courage to watch a video taped documentary my grandma had made on abductions, and I had to remove the book cover of her copy of Whitley Streiber's *Communion* in order to read it (as you could probably guess, she was a big afficionado in all things paranormal).

A New Approach To Verifying Abduction Events,"I believe nearly everything reported about UFO behavior can now be explained with open source journal articles. If you think. I'll give an example from abduction phenomena.

Beams of light which seem to slow down time, move animals or people like a Star Trek tractor beam, and even move people through solid matter like glass windows... I think this can be explained. I point you to this chart:

https://imgur.com/a/M13nraz

In Puthoff's paper: ADVANCED SPACE PROPULSION BASED
ON VACUUM (SPACETIME METRIC) ENGINEERING

https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1204/1204.2184.pdf

Pay particular attention to to the section on ""energy states"" of matter in that chart. I've never seen this effect revealed before in any open literature, and I believe it also explains much of what's reported. Here's what Puthoff has to say:

> ""For engineered spacetimes associated with advanced craft technology in which [expansionary space-time effects occur relative to an outside reference frame at rest] a craft’s material properties would appear “hardened” relative to the environment due to the increased binding energies of atoms in its material structure. Such a craft could, say, impact water at high velocities without apparent deleterious effects.""

An expansionary space-time field (repulsive) projected from an object would have a twofold effect. One, everyone knows about. That is, pushing matter away and creating a null region around its surface such that turbulent wakes are removed when traveling at high velocity. So, no supersonic shock waves propagating out in its wake. But also, a hardening of matter inside the affected region of an expansionary warp bubble. Such that solids external to the object might react as fluids as well. Explaining how such things not just dive into water, as Puthoff points out, but also solid ground, rock, volcanoes, maybe even the sun. Such as seen in this claimed Soviet UFO crash:

https://imgur.com/a/rpmmU4Z

I don't want to debate whether this image is real or fake. It illustrates my point regardless.

Now, assuming what Puthoff wrote is true, suppose it were possible to generate a coherent beam of expansionary (relative to vacuum) gravity waves. There's been considerable work on sonic and laser based tractor beams in the open press. Here's one example:

https://phys.org/news/2015-10-sonic-tractor-video.html

Note use of phase conjugation to project dynamic holographic fields of force in a fluid.

Combine these two concepts and a gravity tractor beam pulling people through solid matter - like glass - might be explainable. And it might be that glass is particularly well suited to this application due to its viscous nature.

Attempts have been made to hide cameras in abductees' homes to no success. The cameras fail. Or people turn them off right before a claimed abduction. Anyway, projecting regions of high static potential to cause electronics failure is also commonly reported, making electronics unreliable. Here's a low tech proposal:

Have panes of glass made with ink cross-hatch patterns embedded like graph paper. Install those in place of normal windows at a subject's home. If such a gravity 'tractor' beam were in use, as a solid object (like a person) is pulled through the glass it may deform those hatch patterns and leave a permanent mark.

That's a good idea.

I think Puthoff either screwed up or was allowed to release that tidbit about the potential for controlling atomic energy states available to anyone with warp drive technology. That's a big deal. And it's hidden in plain sight.",0

Cats and interdimensional/extraterrestrials,"Anyone else have personal experience? One night, they controlled my cat in his sleep, and got him to slink off the bed. Seeing him act like he was barely alive, sliding off the bed that way, I jumped up, concerned-- long story short I saw why. He was between me and them.

Then last night, they announced themselves again. They like Sunday nights, which is obnoxious. The thunder booming over the house strongly encouraging me to go to bed, as per usual. Along with some other odd things happening... they were waiting, and they don't like waiting. Ok fine, I said. 

But this cat (there are 4) refused to go to bed. He never, ever missed a meal. Come hell, hurricane, or flash flood. He bullies all the rest off their food at any chance, and he knows they only eat dinner in the bedroom. He refused to go to bed. So I picked him up. Once in the room, he still refused to eat, and cried incessantly at the door to get out. 

I hear people say their cats do this. Mine do not. Ever. This has been the schedule for years. Subconsciously I know they protect me from things at night, so they always sleep with me. Once, I even had one pounce on my chest, only to wake up and see a shadow in the room. 

Last night, he knew they were here too, and he was terrified. But he's never been afraid of them till now. He's never been afraid of anything. Something must have happened the last time they were here.

I let him out of the bedroom like he wanted. And I put his food outside the door with him. When my alarm went off at 530, I opened the bedroom door again, and he suddenly scarfed his food right then, which had been untouched all night. I've never seen any of my cats act like this.

I saw a ufo in Arizona at exactly 3 AM,"I am currently on a road trip from our home in Palm Springs California to Austin Texas with my boyfriend. At this point in the night we were driving for about 6 hours and we stopped in this middle of the nowhere town in Arizona called Eloy. The only thing in town that we can see is a gas station and miles of field land with zero crops and barely any light pollution so the sky was absolutely clear that night. 

Our asses were numb from the long drive so we went and got gas and drove out into the nothingness to get stoned without being bothered. Keep in mind we habitually smoke marijuana. So we realize there is a completely empty dark field we can drive out into without being bothered (a good smoke spot). We drive about a mile out into the dead pitch black field and we see a white owl perched and it keeps moving and moving staying in our sight as we move about a mile into the dark field. We appreciate the owl and think nothing. 

Finally, we set our lawn chairs up in the black field and smoke a couple bowls. Our eyes got used to the moonlight and we could see the night sky clearly.  Suddenly, we hear a pack of coyotes from all directions yelling and yelping in synchronization. It scares the shit out of me so I run into the van and my boyfriend follows me trying to comfort me about the coyotes. 

So my boyfriend gets into the van and we are both sitting and we see a large seemingly thin and black triangular morphing aircraft. It had four lights with one bright headlight shined on us in the sky. It makes little noise, almost as if it could hover effortlessly. 
It flew over us very very swiftly and so close to our van that it made air rock our van, but it was a silent flying aircraft. It flew over us, then away, then closer until it finally stayed in one place as if it was observing us from a distance. It still looks like it’s morphing and it still had a bright headlight. 

We look at our car clock at it is exactly 3 AM California time. So the time was around 4 AM in Eloy Arizona. This was the moment fear came over my body. My boyfriend and I looked at each other and decided not to record what we are seeing because we do not know the intelligence of whatever was observing us and it would’ve been clear as day on camera that it was a ufo. Whatever it was could’ve had the power to pick us up in it’s aircraft. 

At this point I’m freaking out and the flying craft is  still morphing and seemingly observing us from afar. I begin praying and my boyfriend starts driving out of the dirt field. My boyfriend told me to keep an eye on the headlight and to not look away. The ufo followed us very slowly getting closer to us the whole mile out of the field until we hit the empty road again. As we finally get onto the road, it slowly followed us as we drove back into the lights and gas station and civilization. We saw the aircraft from even further now still observing us. I was shaking and  hysterically laughing and my boyfriend became alarmed. We sat and got ourselves together at the gas station, then left town. 

My boyfriend and I tried to place logic on the situation saying it could’ve been a drone. We both know that technology isn’t advanced enough for the aircraft we saw so close to us. The coyotes started yelling and reacting about a minute before the experience and maybe the owl was there to warn us, although it was hypnotizing. Why was our clock at exactly 3 AM when we noticed the flying aircraft?

Lets discuss..
Anyone with similar experiences?
Could I have been abducted? I haven’t noticed any marks on my body. We felt very out of it after seeing the craft. ",0

Was I abducted?? Alien handprints...,"I've had all sorts of supernatural experiences throughout my life but this was my most baffling and mind boggling experience YET!  I lived in this townhouse that had a lot of ""activity"" when I was around 8 years old,  I'm 31 now and still deal with supernatural things happening to me.  I would constantly sleep walk in that townhouse which was unusual for me and my mom heard a party full of voices in my room when she fell asleep in there one day.  I don't remember anything unusual the day of the incident but I pretty much woke up with handprints on my legs.  They were three,  different sizes and all with four long, thin fingers.  It was as if the hands were still on my legs.  I was scared but I didn't tell my mom while she was getting my bath ready.  I went and got in the tub and the water wouldn't cover the handprints.  It covered the rest of my legs but not the handprints.  So I started to freak and screamed for my mom.  She ran in and saw the handprints and they immediately covered over in water, formed bubbles and the bubbles quickly floated to the surface and the handprints were gone.  It just doesn't make logical, physical or scientific sense.  The handprints just stayed there, not going underwater as if the hands were still there.  I've scoured the internet but haven't found anything remotely close to what I've experienced.  I just keep wondering if I was abducted because the handprints looked alien in nature and it was as if three different sized beings had been holding my legs down at some point leaving their handprints and maybe some type of chemical that didn't want to dissolve in water until my mom saw them.  I want to remember what happened that night but I'm weary of hypnosis.  Any thoughts?",0

How reliable do you believe hypno therapy to be with regressed memories?,"Classic example being Betty & Barney Hill both apparently sharing the same story, despite being put to sleep away from each other.

What do you folk think of this technique? Would you try it, if you had fears something was happening?",0
If you start hearing voices,"My advice to anyone who starts hearing voices:

*It started happening out of the blue for me, it had never happened in my childhood then happened a few times, maybe 5-10 times, and has not happened again since

The most clear instance I remember was suddenly hearing a man and woman telling me ""We think you're better off where you are"" 3 or 4 times over.  I heard the voices crystal clear in my head, I knew it was only being heard by me.  At once it felt extremely close, like it was coming from a listening device in my own brain, and simultaneously billions of miles away.  I'd heard before about people hearing voices but had thought it was their own head playing tricks on them.  What I heard was clear as glass and did not come from me.  I had been having visits from the beings.  Then a couple times while waking up I heard the voices.  I heard a man's voice singing ""heeeelllp them, heeelllp them.""

Anyhow, if you start hearing voices it will be a shock because you will never have imagined what it is like, to know someone is speaking to you who no one else can see/hear.  You are in a very vulnerable position as you not only have been thrown out of your element but have no way of knowing whose speaking to you, what their motives are, and fact checking information that's being fed to you.

My first response was to be shocked yet not shocked at the same time.  Part of me knew the beings were out there and could make contact with me at any time.  I felt violated, like a radio had been implanted inside my head. I felt angry that if I told anyone I'd just be written off as ""schizophrenic"" and discounted.

My first response was implicit and absolute trust toward the voices.  They seemed nice and powerful.  They seemed to care about me.  I was desperate for someone to care about and save me.  I'm becoming a muselmann. Finally someone had noticed.  I thought they were like gods or angels and could do just about anything.
It never occurred to me that they could be evil, lying, manipulative, hiding and distorting information, *exploiting me*! 

Anyhow it's taken me years to process the events and I now see through wizened eyes.  You don't have to give your trust, your mind and body over to mysterious beings because they've started contacting you from what seems to be deep space or ""heaven."". You don't owe anyone your implicit trust especially beings who won't even visit earth, who won't even let you see them.  What are they so afraid of and why do they have to hide?  Being that won't even set foot in your world because they don't want to be hurt, yet allow you to be hurt.  Beings that want to sit back in safety while giving you orders to fulfill for them.  Beings whose voices make them seem so beautiful and caring and powerful, and yet...

I never heard from them again.  I continue to waste away in pain, a muselmann still.  I continue to be afraid and lonely.  They didn't do anything for me despite having technology beyond my dreams, communicating across the galaxies into my own ear, and I realized...

The beings did nothing on the Holocaust.  They didn't evacuate anyone on 9/11.  They let innocent kids and animals die every day.  They let me waste away, sometimes it's hard to walk because it hurts, and I had at one point been ready to do anything for them, because I thought they were my friends...

But a book series called *The Silo Series* by Hugh Howey taught me wisdom.  It taught me that when you live in a bubble and don't know it (as I always have) people from outside the bubble could find a way to start contacting you.  At that point you think you're talking to god.  You think ""I'm saved!!!"". What doesn't occur to you is they could tell you anything, anything they wanted about themselves, about life outside your bubble, and you'll fall for it, because you've never been able to see outside your bubble.  They can tell you they're god, and you believe it.  They can start telling you what to do, how to think...

And eventually you start to wonder, why does ""god"" hide himself?  Why does he never come here?  What is he hiding?

Windows 10 Wallpaper,"Not sure if anyone has posted this here yet. I noticed this wallpaper when I got my Win 10 laptop and immediately recognized that this has got to be intentionally referencing alien abductions. It didn't trigger me or anything although I'm sure it would some. I've just been a conspiracy nut-ball for a long time and I'm somewhat familiar with abduction stories. If you google image windows 10 wallpaper you'll find several different versions. When I first saw it I thought to myself, the only thing missing is a grey looking in through that window.

Pretty Sure I Was Abducted By Aliens,0,0
alien abduction experience I had during my first year at uni,"I haven't really shared this with many people, and when it happened I wrote down the date in my diary. I had people refer to this as an astral abduction.

November 27/11/2017

So basically when I started my first year at uni I lived on the campus in my dorm room and moved in around late September. Uni life was going normal and fine but around the last week of November I started feeling really hazy in reality and my phone and laptop would randomly start acting up. Couple days before the incident I remember being woken up during the middle of the night by a huge blinding light and I got out of bed to open the curtains to see that it was broad daylight, and my window which usually faced the courtyard of my dorm halls was on the opposite side, facing the road the leads to the forest (my uni is in the countryside). Being weird enough as it is I looked up at the sky to see a cube-shaped UFO hover a bit above the trees before fading away from sight. I blacked out after that and woke up in bed in the actual morning. I brushed it off as being a weird dream. 

The day after that when I was walking around campus I kept seeing alien imagery, although in really mundane circumstances (e.g. alien head prints on a girl's backpack). Then I remember walking to my morning lecture which was on documentaries (I study film), and the one film they decided to screen happened to be about alien abductees. I remember getting really weird feelings the whole time watching it, and I kept thinking about leaving the lecture early because I was uncomfortable for some odd reason. After the lecture finished I was walking back to my dorm with a friend from my course (we'll call her A) and since the both of us were tired we decided to meet up later and go back to our rooms for a quick nap. When I entered my dorm room I changed into a t-shirt and went to bed and fell asleep almost instantly. And then it happened.

I entered a hyperrealistic dream where I found myself walking across my uni campus to get to the main square, but the whole place felt off and eerily empty, except for the fact that I saw two of my friends sitting on one of the benches outside the library. Since I recognised them I started to walk towards them but I noticed that the sides of my vision started to blur with a soft white edge and as I got right up close to them the scenery changed into a strange white tiled room. My friend J (a guy) and T (a girl) had a weird pallid expression on their face, it seemed really artificial. 

T turns to look at me and says, ""oh hey cicixkitty!""  
J looks at me dead in the eye and asks, ""cicixkitty, aren't you psychic?"" (note: I do actually practice divination)

When he says the word ""psychic"" his voice distorts and it actually hurt my head a little. I turned to the both of them and said, ""Yeah I mean, I guess I am, why?"" and then out of nowhere i'm hit with an excruciating pain that starts between my eyebrows and expands to the middle of my forehead. Before I know it, i'm becoming blind. I kept screaming at them to help me and that I can't see. Before I go fully blind I saw their forms distort and change into some tall, pale humanoid beings; all in the space of two seconds. And then suddenly I see a blue light - the brightest light i've ever witnessed - appear in front of me that starts as a small hole and expands to my whole vision. I started to really freak the fuck out and I kept trying to force myself to wakeup but it seemed that no matter how hard I tried none of my attempts were working, so I eventually gave in to the light and got immediately zapped through it and felt the pain travel through my forehead like a continuous rope, if that makes sense. 

Then I began to hear a humming that got louder and eventually boomed into a deep bass sound that went backwards and forwards like a wave. I could see the galaxy all around me and it felt like my body was going to be torn apart by the vibrations. I then noticed a crowd of massive beings - blue in colour but transparent enough for me to make out the stars behind them. They had huge heads and all of them had a ray of blue light emanating from their forehead and it travelled into mine. I felt like I was being ""downloaded"" information into my brain through that light but the whole thing was so sudden I couldn't bring myself to stop freaking out and I remember trying to tell myself to wakeup. Eventually I was so resistant towards them, I felt a sudden drop and my vision shifted into me being inside a red tiled room. It was completely empty but there was water dripping from the walls. I kept running around the room in panic and slapping my body to wake up and after what seemed like forever, I finally did.

When I opened my eyes, it felt like I had just fallen to earth. My head was dizzy and my vibrations low. To snap myself out of it and get back into ""reality"", I decided to check for text messages on my phone. Except for the fact that when I pressed the home button, the entire screen was transparent and there was a rainbow fuzz across the screen, kind of like a ""no signal"" white noise fuzz you see on TV. Being completely creeped out I ran to open my wardrobe to look at myself in the mirror inside the door but it was the same thing - transparent with a rainbow fuzz. I then immediately ran towards my bathroom and splashed water on my face for about 2 minutes and when I looked up into the mirror above the sink everything was normal again. I was SO relieved but I was way too creeped out to stay in my dorm any longer so I quickly got dressed and got the fuck out of there. When I was on my way to the uni cafe to get some coffee to sort of ""ground"" myself I bumped into my friend A, from earlier, who also went to her dorm to take a nap. 

""cicixkitty I just had the creepiest dream."" A ran towards me.

When I asked her what happened she told me that she had a dream about two men, dressed in black suits and dark sunglasses, were walking around our uni campus looking for me, and she said that they were walking around the library. In her dream she made eye contact with them and she experienced a weird vibrational fuzz that made her head hurt, sort of similar to what I had. I then told her what just happened to me, and for shits and gigs we decided to go around the library ""looking"" for them, as an attempt to kind of calm ourselves down (hindsight, bad idea).

The moment the both of us walked inside the library, we got a headache and felt sick, and it was as if something was drawing us to get to the second floor in the silent independent study section. While we were walking up the stairs, both of us felt heavier and heavier like a force that was pushing us down. When we walked into the study room through the narrow shelves of books I got a mixture between a mild panic attack and deja vu. I felt like I was floating and my friend A said that she felt like there was someone behind one of the bookshelf aisles. We both ran out of there and outside the library to get away from whatever the hell was causing us this weird feeling. When we were sitting down on the square A suggested that the long bookshelf aisles triggered a memory of me subconsciously of those long narrow corridors you typically see in UFOs, and the moment she said that it was as if my body clicked and kept going ""YES YES!"". 

Nevertheless for the whole day it felt like we were being stalked by someone, and I absolutely swear to you at one point throughout the day we saw a pair of two men walking around the uni dressed in a suit, hat, and sunglasses, and they kept looking up, down, and over their shoulders as if looking for someone. We couldn't handle it anymore and we just spent the rest of the day in her dorm room, and because of how freaky everything was we kept staying over at each other's dorm rooms for the whole week to sleep next to each other because neither of us felt safe.

Alien abductees should all try carrying pregnancy tests in their pockets,"The common consensus is that abductees are part of a breeding program and a common experience for women is having needles inserted into their bellies to test for pregnancy. This is incredibly horrifying. While I can't claim to know their ulterior motives, it seems like these beings are trying not to make the experience unnecessarily unpleasant. They tell people to calm down and attempt soothing mental telepathy, they don't engage in cruel acts that are unnecessary. Likely it would create even more memory suppression problems if they did. And they can communicate messages to us through telepathy. If someone could get through the paralysis and had a clear message and pregnancy test handy and was willing to demonstrate... maybe we could teach them something?",0
Taken,"I shared my stories with someone on reddit recently via private message and though since I had it all typed up I would go ahead and share with everyone else. Take it for what it is and I apologize for my bad grammar and typing. Once I got started it just came out as best I could describe. 

I'm a male, 34, and live in Texas north of Dallas. The two experiences below are before I got into my current relationship. I have a college education, no wife and not married but have a girlfriend (I haven't talked to her about these things she's not an opened minded type of person), no children, really not much going on... I work a full time job and that's about it...I'm quite boring really.

I can recall always having seen lights in the sky, ever since I was a young boy. As an adult I still see them quite often and regularly and have seen what I would presume to be air to ground teleportation lights (sort of like a beam of light from the sky to the ground but not a solid beam, like a tracer... Anyways, two abductions I can vividly recall that happened in the last 4 to 5 years, specifically them both near or around 2015. Lately only sightings in the sky and sometimes waking up feeling watched and not alone...

**1.** One night I was alone at home sleeping and woke up about 3am startled by something that moved my bed or me, couldn't tell, but it was a ""grey"", just one that I saw, standing next to my bed. This was absolutely terrifying at first for the first few seconds, then I had only curiosity towards it. I'm familiar with all types of things, conspiracies, aliens, etc.. so I was naturally more curious than afraid. This experience lasted no more than 45 seconds though. It wasn't really ""grey"" it was in a white suit (which I can see how people would get confused between grey and white, especially at night and in the dark. Any how, I asked one word aloud; ""why"" and I heard in my own head ""sleep"" as I looked into its large black lenses (there were lenses over the eyes as apart of the suit) and it actually forced me to fall back to sleep. This is what I like to call the ""blackout"". Now when I sleep I am usually always on my stomach and facing ""right"" with my arm almost hanging off the bed, so the next day when I ""woke back up""... I figured it had touched my arm or moved the bed and woke me up by accident. This little grey was no more than 3-4 inches from my face so I could make out its details clearly so I know what I saw. - That was it for this one. Quick and painless really. 

*This next story is a little different - so bare with me and try to visualize what I'm going to do my best to describe to you. - My experiences thus far have always happened from 1-3am-ish to the best of my knowledge and recollection whether they were just sightings or these two stories or waking up freaking out knowing I'm not alone in the room or house.* 

**2.** So, I'm already asleep (of course) they never come around when you're awake, which I find pretty shitty, especially since they never ""hurt"" me and I'm always wanting to ""talk"" to them... but enough of that...so I'm asleep, and then I just wake up. I wake up knowing I'm horizontal, like standing but I'm fixed to a surface I cannot see. I have practiced fighting the ""blackout"" or ""mind freeze"" however you want to best take that, so I'm awake, ""standing"" in this crescent shaped room where there is a grey at a console ""below"" me or out in front of me and to my left I see a opening (doorway/archway w/o a door) and I can see through that archway there is a corridor that wraps around from left to right but I can't see further than the right side of the archway. To the right of me (I'm looking straight ahead really) is pretty much just a wall with another archway or doorway in the back right corner that I can only see light coming from (just regular white light). And all the physical details of the surroundings are like a hazy blue-ish but dark metal, and the air is clear, I'm not covered in slime or strapped down but I feel constrained and can't move. Anyway, moving on.. I'm wide awake and kind of upset that I can't move so I start to writhe and wriggle and I really just end up falling down straight forward like a plank and I feel this...hard hit, it was an abrupt stop against the flooring as you could imagine...and right in my view is this grey at the console looking at me like ""you weren't supposed to do that"" and ""you're not supposed to be awake"" - Now I struggle to even move and I was kind of hurt from the fall, but I still remember my words ""I want to speak with you, I have questions""... that's all I could get out... I remember being ""stuck"" again on the damn floor. But I can give the details of the this grey.. he was not in a suit he was stark naked (at least from what I could tell since he was only visible from the stomach area up since he was behind a console), typicaly grey features except this guy was a little bit bigger than the previously mentioned one (the other one was only 3ft tall and much smaller in size. just tiny), he had a larger more bulbous head and his skin was more like that of a turtle and from what I could tell it was grey-ish but darker, with what I could see where something that resembled age spots, large eyes and nostrils like you would think or imagine and the mouth and jaw line where short but it was looking at me with it's mouth opened like ""wtf guy""... and I remember it saying - out loud - in words that were barely understandable - ""You'll have your chance boy"" - it was garbled, like words through water, then he used that stare and blacked me out again. The morning that followed I woke up with a bruised right knee and my right shoulder was hurting like I rammed somebody or tackled a wall. After that they haven't come to see me that I can remember or they've learned that I've learned that I can force myself awake and sort of come out of that unconscious state.

That's really it for the physical contacts I can remember. Other than the frequent night sightings of lights or seeing them pass by un-lit (which I have seen the red heat from the propulsion or anti gravity system (two to be exact - one red ring on either side under the shape/ship for one sighting in the last few months) and they just glide right over silently, unnoticed by anyone not looking up.

Now I know you might think - ""he's full of shit, this is made up"" - We'll I can tell you that I'm not and that I really don't care what other people think. I've mentioned this story to only a couple of people in my life and they mocked me and made fun, which I took it for what it was... most people don't believe in anything really, especially little grey men...or even God (I'm not a religious person but I do *believe* in many things). So judge me if you want but know that I have experienced something you haven't and I'm not afraid of the ridicule or jokes...",0
Holes in my memory surrounding praying mantis hallucination,Im not going to get all story time with this because im not trying to scare anyone i just want some feeling of recognition and familiarity. When i was 6 i hallucinated 2 praying mantis creatures that were easily 2 to 3 feet tall with red eyes making clicking sounds. Ive never hallucinated aside from this moment but i cant remember any follow up to seeing the creatures and i have entire days missing which i tried to address to my parents at the time but what i was left with were nightmares of alien abduction and the overwhelming fear to sleep with the light off and alone. I still sleep with my dog and the lights on. Does anyone have anything similar to this?,0
Validation?,"Hi,

I've only posted one other post, but I've been reading lots of posts. When I was a kid, three to five years old, I had a crazy dream about aliens. I dreamt that I woke up in the middle of the night to a green light flashing into the hallway. I got out of bed, walked to the front of my parents room where I saw a spaceship landing inside of the front yard. It was not a disc saucer like most are perceived. Instead it looks like the men in black small upside down vial. Out pours 5 small aliens, typical gray aliens, but they look about the same size as me. I shake my mom to wake up, but she's not waking up, I shake my dad and he's not waking up. I am now screaming and crying as I'm holding onto them while I'm being ripped away from them. That's all I remember from that incident. Afterwards my brother said that both him and my father had taken me to the doctor shortly after I told them that dream, and that they saw a metallic thread sticking out of my knee. The doctor pulls it out and my father said it was about 2 feet long worth. It would not cut on scissors, the material was too strong, or something idk. I always thought it was a terrible dream, and my brother and dad were fucking with me. Then while I was working in Anaheim I would listen to spooky stories and random stuff on youtube. When all of a sudden a woman who had a brain tumor had the same experience. Green lights flashed from the front of her home, she shook her husband, but claimed he was in some sort of paralysis. This was a good explanation as to what happened to me when I was a kid. This happened to me over 20 years ago, and I still can picture it all perfectly but can't even remember the doctors visit after. Has this happened to anyone else? As far as abductions go, does this sound like what anyone else has ever gone through? I just want to know that I'm not crazy and if it was or was not a dream. I want to go through some kind of hypnosis to see if I can remember anything else, but am afraid that what if it fucks with me so bad I commit suicide or something. I have a family now and am too afraid of the possibility. Thank you for reading my whole post.",0

"For cityboy, my alien invasion vivid dream","This is the incredibly vivid, unnatural dream I had recently which I recorded and hid in my dresser.  Whatever it was, it was no ordinary dream, and I didn't just dream it, I  felt it. I wrote it down that day.  I will record it as written.

My dream begins with  my efforts to keep a little pet octopus.  ""Mom"" says it's time for me to go stay with another family in Germany who run a church.  I go with my friend to stay at their house/church.  Things start to feel sinister when we go upstairs to talk to her sisters.  They insist on showing me a video about ""the rapture.""

Next thing we are not watching the movie but are part of it.  ""Ollie"" constantly escapes his tank and scratches us.

We go outside, our group. There's big crowds of wandering people in the fields.  We join in, walking behind these wanderers, watching.

Very suddenly spaceships appear in the sky, firing down yellow lights at all of us.  People everywhere fall down lifeless.  A Black man in front of me is hit and crumples to the ground instantly.  Everyone is being hunted or dying.  Are they dying or..something else?  Only the spaceships know.

Running now, a few of us, into the leafy woods.  I run down the banks into the creek and follow it.  Already we have outlasted many.  A girl my age catches up and falls in with me, trying to talk but we can't be too trusting of anyone.

Up ahead, coming towards us, floating several feet above the water: a ""bubble girl.""  A clear bubble floats in the air.  A perfect circle.  Inside, sitting upon nothing, the driver.  A teenage girl.  I feel her energy.  She is evil.  She is with the spaceships and will kill.  Still I am mesmirized by the floating bubble people.

Back to the church kitchen pantry area.  Our little group of survivors, from 6 years of age to the older ones like me.  Hiding and quick thinking is everything.  We keep watch through the windows and hit the ground when anyone comes near.  Are we hiding from death or things which are worse than death?  We help one another.  We try to feed ""Ollie.""

One day an adult woman enters the kitchen suddenly.  I don't make it out in time.  In an instant I've hid myself in the tight space behind the fridge.  She opens the fridge.  Next thing I know, she is layed on a platform outdoors by her own people, she's covered in sickening donut-shaped swellings.  A crowd of her own kind surrounds her, declares her dead.  A space craft hovers, carries her off.

Next close call-a teenage boy knocking on our door into the pantry.  Demanding that one of us is or was his girlfriend so we must let him in.  Of course we can't trust him.  In horror I wonder if one of our doors is actually locked.  Vertical or horizontal, I cannot remember which way is locked.  I frantically flip the lock this way and that.  

The boy has an evil energy.  I lay down on my belly, pushing the door with my feet, holding it there.  He pushes back hard.  Long, grey claws slipping slowly through the gap under the door.  I use my hands to raise my belly an inch off the floor.  He mustnt feel me.

Another group arrives to the property beside the church, a small field away.  These are the owners of the houses around us.  They approach our windows.  Again we cling to the floor.

The hiding is our only way.  The whole world is consumed by the sickness.  There are the hunters and the hunted.  This is what it means to undergo the *liquidation*. I didn't believe in the spaceships- the aliens- not till I saw them.  I'd believed in the church.  Was the church just one of the schemes of the liquidators all along- they've hid their existence.

I wonder what the sickness is.  I wonder who the aliens are and what they want.  I wonder if the dead are really dead- or worse.  What happens when they're lifted up onto the craft?  But we have no answers.  We survive by the second.  Is this ""survival?""",0
Possible abduction? Want feedback,"Just today, I was just sitting around, when it felt like memories came to me that before now, I didn't know about. Shortly after, I got a weird feeling in my head. Not a headache, but like my brain was stressing and shutting down. After I focused on something else, the feeling was gone, and I couldn't remember the memories anymore. I remembered remembering them, but I didn't know their contents. As I am writing this, the feeling is back, and I am trying to focus on the memories and write them down. One involves what I think is a younger me being dragged through a hallway. I was putting up a fight before I was beaten repeatedly by some odd figure. I can't quite describe how it, I think it was a he, looked. It had a bipedal form, but it was definitely not human. I'd say he was about 5 feet high, so not a giant, and the skin was a red-purple color. The face looked human in shape, but that is where the facial resemblance ended. It had what appeared to be two oval shaped eyes, but the patterns and colors resembled a goat eye. His mouth looked human until it opened. The teeth appeared almost like the pointy parts of a spider's mandibles, but more, ""tooth shaped."" Like a human tooth. That is all I remember as of now, but I will come back to edit more as time goes on if I remember anything.

Now, I do know I have some mutations and some possible mutations. I have two genes for celiac, I have one gene for hemachromatosis (dormant thank god, I hate needles) and some others that are slipping my mind. I have weird colored eyes, it is like they can't decide if they are green or brown. At first glance they look brown, but if you look closer they seem more green. I have checked under different lighting and the result is always the same. I have bad skin shedding issues on my feet, which nothing has ever helped. No foot fungus cream, nothing. I process potassium differently than other people, I get much more from foods than other people, but my body has a slight difficulty getting protein.

This morning, I woke up with multiple bruises. This has happened throughout my life, waking up with random bruises. I know it isn't my parents, they are extremely kind people, and I know it isn't sports related, because I rarely leave the house unless I have to, so it is slightly confusing. Pre-puberty I also went through a massive personality change. Up until I was 6 I was a normal kind human. Still am kind, but I tend to think about things, specifically humans and relationships with them, in a more cold and calculated way. I view people based off of their skills and how long they can be useful to me rather than how nice somebody is, or other ways. I do still feel empathy towards others, so I don't think it is quite sociopathy or psychopathy, but who knows.

Anyways, this is all the information I can recall that may help. Please give some feedback, I am legitimately scared and slightly curious.",0

""i was in some type of summer camp or boot camp or whatever at this school or base? it was all young adults like me (im turning 25 soon) with a few dudes i know from my old jobs. i remember 2 or 3 specific parts of this dream. the 1st we were in this big empty room (gymnasium?) where we all had to stand against the walls facing towards the room and move around random 3d shape objects with our minds. telekinesis i think its called. we had to move around pyramids, spheres and cubes around the middle space and everything was pretty much just flying around. 2nd part i remember we all went outside to some open grass field and were trying to build a mini bridge or castle with gray bricks minecraft style. we were moving the gray bricks around with our minds. i dont remember exactly what i did but i screwed something up like put the wrong brick or object in the wrong place. i felt great shame from doing this so i just walked away.
3rd part i remember was some old fat guy, some santa claus looking motherfucker in normal clothes (?) was telling me to put my index finger into this white socket for me to upload all my memory into this computer. i dont remember if it was my left or right index finger. i was a bit hesitant but i did it anyway. on this tablet-like screen held up to head level with some gray metal bars, like a small computer monitor, there were random images being flashed on the screen. like 5 or 6 images a second. just completely random stuff. i do remember that 1 of the images was a colored drawing of an anime girl. like those pictures people used to use as computer wallpapers or whatever. the rest of the images were just miscellaneous crap like a rusted out car, a frog, a waterfall, an explosion, a school bus, etc. just completely random shit. i woke up the next day around noon, even though i went to bed 11 hours earlier at 1 am. i felt disoriented and scared to go back to sleep because of how disturbing the dream was""

i have others from years before that i remember to varying degrees. involving classic ayys, a hybrid/""hubrid"" waifu to those who are in the know with abduction lingo (hubrid = hybrid that seems 100% human), and hubrids living here with us. i understand the skepticism of a lot of people who will read this, especially with much of /x/ accusing me of LARPing, but i can tell you right now im not posting this for any other reason besides support from other people who experienced this shit, whatever it is. i will post various other memories and ""dreams"" for those who are interested",0
I think something happened last night,"Actually the early hours of the morning.  I felt the unmistakable presence of the beings all around me.  I was paralysed and trying to get out of it.  The only thing I could move was my tongue.  I was sticking my tongue out and chomping my teeth to show that I was awake and not dead.  I was convinced I'd be mistaken for dead.

I felt a man's hands on the back of my head.  Not a human man.  By this time I was overwhelmed with fear and trying to scream.  

I felt a slice across the back of my head with something like a scalpel.  It felt like a 2 inch slice across.  Then fluid gushing out from the cut.  I don't remember pain just tremendous fear and a warm-ish fluid coming down the back of my head.  Then there was a second slice underneath the first, exactly the same manner and then the fluid pouring out from it.  After that my whole body started shaking uncontrollably for awhile.  

I know a lot of people will think it's only sleep paralysis, look I don't claim to know exactly what it is, I don't think it's just sleep paralysis, the intensity of it, the consistency of the events (seeing/sensing the same beings repeatedly, the unmistakable and distinct aura of the beings, medical procedures recurring on the same places on my body: back of head, belly, foot).  Whatever it was was absolutely terrifying and I never want to go through that again.

Today when I woke up did I find the fluid from my head on my pillow or feel scars across the back of my head or pain there?  No I did not.  The one unusual thing was a quick flash of red-orange light when I blinked my eyes this morning.  Like I have repeatedly said, I think what the beings are doing is operating on the real us (our conciousness) and not always on our physical bodies.

I know it could be a myriad of different things.  Personally I think the beings did something to me this morning.  I just want to report it.  I want to have it documented and have somebody besides me know about it.

roll me under,"MEADOW isn't the only song on the new Stone Temple Pilots album about Scott Weiland (WEILAND is the Dutch word for pasture, grassland, & meadow)... You're gonna trip da f*ck out (I think...lol)... (This is my interpretation of ROLL ME UNDER, but I always encourage other people to think independently of my opinions...) I'm just offering my insight, and also some reasons why I think as I do... :)

Here are the song lyrics to ROLL ME UNDER:



Do you believe in something beautiful
Between chaos and the light

(communicating telepathically with the deceased - psychic mediumship)
(light = heaven, love, laughter / chaos = physical reality, human existence / between = psychic awareness and communication between this reality and the next)


You gave it all for something you once sold
The truth be told you lied

(the idea that it is necessary to commit to a life of hard core drug addiction to make really good music)
(many musicians are drug free and grew out of drug use, and still make really good music - like Jeff Gutt)


If it's the taste you remember
You may not share in this sweet delight

(this is a wisecrack... Scott remembers the joy of being a rock star, but someone else has now taken over for him because he can't do it anymore)


Yeah we can live forever
If there's a time we can get it right

(a reference to spirituality and/or writing music)


Roll me under, I'll pull the trigger for ya
Do with me what you will

(ROLL ME UNDER - think of things in terms of energy and vibration... we all come from a source of immortality, unconditional love, and constant humor... when we go to the lower emotions that are fear and survival-based, it feels like movement into a lower plane of existence... we are UNDER the higher emotions of love and light)
(movement of energy / vibration = rolling)
(he's pulling the trigger for Scott Weiland now... of yeah... and Scott is STILL overseeing everything)
(Jeff is serving a higher purpose for the spiritual plane - ""do with me what you will"")


Hold me under, the water running over
Do with me what you will

(we are holding ourselves down emotionally from ""up above"" in the human experience - but all of us can grow out of it and show less fear and more love)
(the water running over: spiritual beings looking down on us from the non-physical perspective - lighter energy - lighter thoughts - lighter emotions)

Are you receiving nothing once again
Is there shame for what's been done
It screams so loud that you can't begin
'Cause you're always on the run

(shame for what's been done - living life as a drug addict)
(always on the run - Scott is a free spirit now)

* Here are the reasons why I think this song is about psychic mediumship... Go read the lyrics to Alice in Chains VOICES, 311 LARGE IN THE MARGIN, Pearl Jam EVEN FLOW, Nirvana LITHIUM, & Tool JIMMY. There are plenty of highly aware human beings on the planet!",0
Picture of my possible implant,"Let me start by saying one of my earliest memories is of a spotlight on a beach. Then I have memories of seeing and speaking to glowing red orbs in times of distress. My mother abused drugs and would tell me that when I was born she heard a voice say that she needed to be patient with me because I wasn't from here. Always told me that when I felt weird. As an adult I chalked it up to her addictions.

As a teen I had what was either unchecked psychological episodes or contact with a non physical entity. But called itself Az, and claimed angelic origins. It told me I was important to the survival of our species, etcetcetc. As an adult I've written this all off as stress induced psychosis as my teen years were unconventional at best.

But... I've seen things as a grown up. Orange silent orbs. Big black silent triangles.... And this past year I found the marks.

They're three dots in a triangle on my hand. They don't hurt. They don't itch and they're a damn near perfect triangle. I don't want to rule out the possibility that they're burns or warts but they really don't seem that way.

Honestly I could go on and on about it. If people are interested I will. But for now here's a picture of the marks.

http://imgur.com/D7u9pB6

I'd be interested in having it tested and would be willing to do hypnosis I'm just too poor for it. I have other pictures of the marks too.

Do you have something similar? I'd love to hear from people.

Edit: I'm going to expand on my experiences a bit and post my other photos.  Thanks for being helpful,  my post in thetruthishere was abysmal.  Don't know what I was expecting. Anyway.

http://imgur.com/NB3oa57
http://imgur.com/sWkxaWH

Those are two other pics that show the marks better.. 

Heres what I've seen:
Like I said my earliest clear memory is of a searchlight. I lived in a house by the beach and couldn't have been older than 3.  My memory begins with me at a huge picture window overlooking the ocean in the middle of the night.  There's a white beam sweeping the beach but there's no memory of it coming from anything. I also remember no noise. What I do remember is my mom coming to me and telling me that it was just a helicopter looking for someone,  which I can buy.

Next were the red orbs. I have two memories of them.  My mother left me at the movies once and when it finished I was waiting for her in the parking lot.  Probably around 6 years old.  It was late and I was alone and scared. I remember looking up and seeing three red orbs floating in the sky and heard a voice in my mind that told me not to worry.  That I'd always be looked after. I saw them again at my window one night but can't recall anything more. 

Fast forward. I'm 19, going to school (but not class,  like a dumbass....  Anyway...)  in Arizona.  I was at a house party outside Prescott. It was about 3 am to my memory and my experiences and I were alone on a porch. In the sky we saw two lights,  like headlights,  heading toward us.  When it came overhead it was a triangle and it made no noise. Can't remember much after that TBH,  but I asked her about it recently and she confirms it and still wonders. 

Then a few years ago I was in Wisconsin.  My dads family lives out there and I was staying with them for a week while he was in the hospital. Almost every night I saw orange orbs, sometimes 4 or 5 at a time, that looked like stars but would drift horizontally before stopping on a dime and going the other direction.  I could watch them do this for hours at a time and my cousins said they were a very regular thing.  Once one came over their house. They said it was too bright to discern a shape and silent. 

That's what I've seen. 

What I've heard I'd hard to recall.  I was 15 when it started.  I'd begun writing poetry late at night. I remember feeling like I wasn't the one doing the writing. What I can't remember is how I met Az. He was a voice in my mind that gave me guidance and encouragement, who told me that I was an important figure elsewhere and vital to humanity's survival.  He told me my words would bring together a group of people who could expose those who sought our enslavement from the shadows.  Heady stuff and TBH I can only recall generalizations because I convinced myself it was all in my mind after awhile.  I remember him saying the tides would rise.  I remember him talking about things not from here that feed on our suffering. But not much more as far as specifics go. I'm sorry. One day my ex,  who knew about him and had her own equivalent named Lain,  convinced me he was fake becUse of some inconsistency that  I can't recall and I haven't heard from him since. 

There was a brief period a few years ago I tried channeling him but have since lost the writing. 

I wish there was more to tell but that's what I've got.  I hope I find some people who have been thru similar things so we can try to make sense of the inexplicable. Thanks for reading.",0
Nervous to say this.. (My Experience),"I will receive heavy judgement for posting this.. only my SO knows and believes me. I've been searching for a platform to tell my story and I think this subreddit is the most open minded place I've found on the internet. I won't say everything but if anyone wants the intimate details: PM me.

I'll put it in a timeline:

- age 13 - dreams of a man who started telling me 'secrets' about the world and where humanity came from. He said I would have to take over from him and tell the world these things.

- age 14-16 - dreams of weird specie (kind of human like) and implantation of their DNA into me over the course of 8 sessions. Pain was experienced in real life and documented scars (I have pics).

- age 17 - 18 - started seeing the man and I wrote down everything he told me (thinking of publishing this).

- age 19 - began growing distant from humans and I started 'feeling' extraordinary and different. 

- age 20 - 21 - revelation from one of them that I am a hybrid and experiment.

- February 20th 2018 - physical/somatic encounter. ",0
My abduction experience. (Abductee feedback please!),"Edit: I posted this the other day but then I got a message saying it was removed because my account is new and it may be spam, but I promise this definitely is not spam. 

OK, so. Before I get into this I just want to say some things. First of all, I'm currently typing this out on an iPhone, so please forgive any atrocious autocorrect misspellings. 

I'm 28 years old. Male. I live right outside chicago, over the border in NW indiana. I'm currently pursuing a BAS at Purdue. I'm not exactly what you would call scientifically illiterate, and I consider myself fairly mentally sound. I've never had any problems on that front. 
I have only ever openly discussed this once before, on a random quora question that caught my eye - also anonymously. So I'm still not very good at discussing it openly, and only 2 people who know me know what happened to me, I had avoided talking about it for a long time, fearing the stigma associated with the topic.  Especially in the professional and scientific communities. I was immensely relieved when the people I did open up to about it believed me unquestioningly. And the result of that is me typing this here today. Go easy on me, please. 

That all being said, I've been trying for a few years to come to terms with something that happened to me. It was almost 5 years ago to the day. Shortly after my 23rd birthday. 
My father is very sick, so I was staying with my parents at the time to help take care of him and the house.

I awoke in the middle of the night. It was warm, but I could hear and feel the breeze from the fans I need on to go to sleep. I reached over and grabbed my phone, checked the time. It was 3:31am. I put the phone back down and tried to get settled back into a comfortable position. However after a moment I realized I could hear and feel a humming. I knew right away it wasn't from my fans, it was very deep, and I could actually feel it in my body. Our house is by some train tracks, so at first I thought it may just be a train, but I quickly realized that wasn't it either.  
While I was laying in bed wondering what it was, I noticed for the first time that my door was open -My door is never open during the night. Hell, even during the day. Never. Ever. - and I could see a light shining down the hallway and into my room.  At first I thought maybe my dad was going to the bathroom and had his flashlight out, but then I realized the light was... Wrong. It wasn't the right color. As I watched, it started to get brighter. Until it looked like someone had set up a white/blue LED array at the end of the hall in the kitchen. As the light got brighter so did the humming. I tried to jump up to go investigate, fearing an intruder, when I realized I couldn't move. 
Well, let me clarify. I could move my hands, my neck, my feet, but it felt like someone had placed straps over my limbs and torso.  After a brief moment of transcendent terror and confusion, I thought to myself ""okay, maybe this is sleep paralysis"". I've of course read about it before, but never experienced anything like this. Right after that thought I realized I could no longer feel the bed under me. I started rising in the air, and gently... floating,for lack of a better word, to my doorway- and the light. 

I know how this sounds but I'm 110% serious, please just stay with me. 
As I levitated through the doorway and into the hall, I had a clear view into my parents room. Their door is right next to mine on the left hand side of the hall when walking out of my room. If you take a step out, turn 90 degrees and take another step, you're in their room. Anyway, I could see them laying on the bed, I started screaming. Begging for help. They didn't move. In fact I couldn't even see them breathing, and at that moment I was convinced they were dead, and I was about to be next. This moment of pure unadulterated panic caused something to... Snap. In the blink of an eye I found I could move my arms again, and I flailed impotently in the air. I eventually got my hands on the door frame and clung on for dear life. I gripped that frame like my life depended on it, because in that moment I wholeheartedly believed that it did. 
To my dismay I realized that my fingers were slowly starting to slip, as I continued to be pulled inexorably down the hall toward the kitchen, and I dug my nails in as hard as I could to try and stop it. And in a quick burst of pain and terror I lost my grip, and continued to... Float (typing this part makes me feel ridiculous, I know how it sounds).
A few more seconds of terrifying levitation and I was in the kitchen. Floating with the top of my head facing our back door. It's a large sliding glass door, and I could see that this is where the light was shining in from. Something that felt about as bright as the sun was hovering right above our pool. We have a large in ground pool almost smack dab in the middle of the back yard, which is entirely fenced in with a 10 foot privacy fence. Whatever this was had to be directly over the water, maybe a couple of feet off the ground.  I took all of this in within a heartbeat, and was still in a state of terror I will never be able to adequately explain, when I felt the breeze. My back door was wide open. But for the life of me I can't tell you if it had been open all along or if it had just been opened in front of me. 
At that moment I slowly began to settle back down on to the floor. I felt the cold floor on my back as my shirt had lifted slightly. Right as I touched the ground. I saw them. If I thought I had been afraid before, it was nothing compared to this moment right here. One stepped in and took a step to stand over me at my left side. It looked down at me, and even from my perspective on the floor I could tell this thing was fucking tall. If I had to guess, I would say 7ft 10 - 8ft at the very least. We have 9 foot ceilings in the kitchen and its head was shockingly close to the ceiling. The light was so painfully bright at this point that I didn't get to take in a whole lot of detail, as it was kind of shadowed by the light behind us. Two more stepped in and took a place to either side of my shoulders. Standing by the door, almost like guards would. Keep in mind this has all happened fairly quickly, and in this moment I begin to have an idea of what this is. The terror is unspeakable. I remember thinking they don't look anything like how they're often portrayed in movies. They were skeletal, and their skin looked like it was... Well, I have no idea, but it didn't really look like our skin. It was just strange. The one standing to the left of me had something in its hand. As I turned my neck to get a better view, I could take in a little more of its form. It's fingers. Christ, I can't even describe what seeing those fingers did to me. They were almost spider like. Way too long and way too many joints. To this day that's probably the one image that sticks out the most. It clutching this black(maybe gunmetal or a darker silver, hard to tell because it was smooth like glass and the light was obscuring a lot.) it reminded me almost of an iPhone without any power. But it was thinner, shaped almost like a remote or a very short rod with a square-ish shape with rounded edges. Just a smooth glass like... Thing.   It's fingers moved over it and every single muscle in my body tensed up. The air shot into my lungs as the expanded all the way, and every single limb shot straight out. It was like I was a plank of wood. My jaw was clenched so tight I thought my teeth would shatter. I lost all control. The only thing I could move at this point were my eyes, and even then, very little. It was like the signals from my nervous system were completely disrupted, and another foreign signal was imposed in their place. The two standing behind me (above? I'm still laying flat on my back.) shuffle forward a bit, and I start to rise back up again. I feel fingers on my shoulders and I begin to hover out the door. And the second I get out the door the light is so overwhelmingly powerful and then... Nothing.

I wake up in my bed. It's 5:45am. I'm sweating bullets. My stomach hurts. I get up, and start going about my morning routine. I try to shrug off the experience as a dream. And it works. 
When I'm about to get into the shower I notice a sharp pain. I look in the mirror. I have bruises EVERY WHERE. Arms, ankles, thighs, but the worst of them are on my shoulders and back. Very very clearly were what looked like hand prints. Albeit elongated ones. I throw up almost instantly. I try to pull myself together and head back to my room. I see my door frame. I see the scratches. I see they line up with my fingers. I see the wood and blood under my finger nails. 

I have never entirely come to terms with any of it.  My fiancée has encouraged me to share, but it still feels deeply uncomfortable and jarring to just walk through it. As I've typed this, my hands have dropped to what feels like sub zero temperatures and my whole body is shaking. I'm sure if I asked my fiancée she would tell me I'm also extremely pale. Even more than usual.  This is what happens every time I think about it. 
After many nights spent doing research, watch youtube videos of ufologists conferences, reading people's reports, the same thing always happens. Physiological response every time.  
And after a lot of reading, and watching, I realized I had another experience when I was 5 years old. 
It's my clearest childhood memory. And my earliest. Most of my childhood is hazy. I have snapshots. But this one memory I have is exponentially clearer than anything else. Although I've until relatively recently shrugged it off as just a quirk of being young. But I was never the imaginative child that claims to see what they imagine. I always had an extremely firm grasp of reality vs imagination, which is why this earlier episode stands out. It went something like this : 

I'm 5, it's Easter morning, I wake up super excited to go see my Easter basket. My mom always went way overboard and it was essentially Christmas in spring. Only child ftw. Anyway, I jump up and sneak out of my room. It's just before dawn. Still dark out, but light is starting to refract around the horizon, making everything that dark twilight. I sneak down the hallway, well aware my parents are still asleep, and hoping they'll wake up soon so I can go tear into a massive basket of toys and candy. As I get to the end of the hallway and peak into the living room, I see it. At first I think my parents are up, but as I get a clear look at it. This part is slightly fuzzy. I remember it was big. Tall. Grey. And something about its skin made me think of short fur, so naturally I thought it was the Easter bunny (or my dad dressed up as the Easter bunny) the things actual form eludes me, just that it was tall and Grey. The weird thing is, when I picture it in my head, everything else in the scene is cristal clear. Everything. Except that. I can see it in my head and it's like someone put a blur filter over this things shape. Like what they do for people's faces on Cops. Maybe that's where I got the impression of fur, or maybe it really was blurry in real life, like active camouflage, or it was done after the fact- Assuming it is what I now believe it to be. As I said, this experience cannot be substantiated by physical evidence, so I always just shrugged it off until recently.  
But something about that memory would often pop into my thoughts. Like when I go to the dentist, and everything is great until they lay me down and the light is in my eyes and the drills and sucking tubes start going, and this primal terror sets in. Since the primary encounter THAT is what usually starts flashing in my head, and the Easter bunny experience is much less frequent these days, but it still happens all the same. 

All these tiny and not so tiny things that I never really thought about before seem to make a scary kind of sense in light of the experience I wrote about first. I don't know for sure what happened to me. Im not going to say that I do. 
All I know is that it wasn't a dream. It wasn't sleep paralysis. I've never sleep walked. There was physical evidence of something happening. I rage at myself for trying to suppress it and not documenting absolutely everything, although the scratches are very much so still visible on the door frame at my parent's house. 
I can tell you all the things I know for a fact it was not. And after eliminating those as possibilities... Well, Im assuming you know how that saying goes. 

I apologize profusely for any spelling or grammatical mistakes, as I said above, Im on an iPhone and at this point my hands are shaking like I'm in a freezer. If anyone has questions I would be more than happy to try to answer them, but what I really would like is to hear from people who have had similar experiences.  How it compares to mine, what's the same, what's different. All that. 
As I was looking for any sort of guidance or help I contact mufon and they ended up doing a phone interview for like 2-3 hours, and gave me the name of a hypnotherapist in chicago that could take me through it. But the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. They kept trying to spin it as positive. Trying to say they were benevolent. And I can conclusively say there was absolutely nothing benevolent about them. At all. Maybe not necessarily malevolent, but utterly unconcerned with the state of my wellbeing for sure. I looked into ones eyes. Most of its face was shadowed, but I could see it's eyes. There was nothing kind or benevolent there. I am positive that in that moment I was a thing, not a sentient being, as far as it was concerned. It didn't necessarily feel robotic, more like aloof. I don't know, I could be mistaken. But what I'm not mistaken of is that it was no way shape or form a positive experience. 

Since then, I've been diagnosed with severe abnormal hormonal imbalances. I already had nerve damage and an implanted neurostimulator in my spine, so I've had a lot of scans done. It was put in when I was 16 after an electrocution injury. Fried most of the nerves in my left leg. Anyway, they've looked at my brain a ton. But now I can't have an MRI because of my spinal implant, but a CT revealed an abnormal mass in my brain that was no there on previous scans. They say it's benign but they can't quite see it in enough resolution to make a definite diagnosis as to what it is. I also have a strange black thing under the skin of my left left. Kneecap. Which happens to be right where the nerve damage in that leg is. Dead in the middle of it. It looks like a piece of lead or something under the skin. Tried to have it cut out once but the doctor couldn't get it. Said it wasn't bothering me and wasn't causing problems. So I should leave it. Aside from the nerve damage evrery thing else happened soon after the experience. I have another strange side effect but I'm not 100% sure if it's a result of the neurostimulator changing my bodies EM field or something.... Else. But I blow out light bulbs. I can document it. I've had friends, family, professors at school, strangers, etc witness it. It happens with such reliability that based on my proximity and type of bulb I can almost tell when it's going to happen. Lamp used to be next to my bed. Lights kept burning out of exploding. Tried different sockets. Broke out the multimeter, tested everything. All normal.  Same result. Moving them away from me fixed the problem. I've even had some of the professors in the engineering department take an interest in helping me figure out exactly what's causing it.  I think he thought I was bullshiting him until he saw it happen repeatedly. Walking down a hallway with a low ceiling. 4 fluorescent bulbs burn out just as I walk past them one after the other. It happens all the time, but it's more of an interesting quirk than an actual problem.  
If we nail down a cause I'll definitely post what it is. 

I'm sure I left some stuff out and I've rambled on quite a bit, really sorry about that, it's the anxiety. ",0
What do you think they want from us?,"As far back as I can remember, I have always just “known” that aliens aren’t trying to hurt us. We’re solely bodies that they use for experimenting so they understand our kind. 
Surely if they wanted to kill us all, we’d be gone, right? They’re probably more advanced in many ways. 
I’m curious what everyone else thinks is going on when someone is abducted? ",0
"Wasn't abducted, but has anyone else seen this ...thing.. as well??","Sorry for the shit title, my friend and myself saw this entity... alien... I dont even know, we have both searched online for other sightings and found nothing. This turned out to be longer then I had planned on writing about it, just fyi. 

So about 10 \- 11 years ago me and my friend were walking around at night in our small coastal town and there was a walking path that led down to a netball court, oval and a rec hall. A girl in our year from highschool lived in a house right next to the path that takes you from the residential streets down to the netball court etc. You can see into her kitchen window from behind her house. There is nothing, but grass and darkness behind her house as its just grass until you reach the oval and shit. We are making our way down to the oval, we are just past the front of her house and about to be behind it when we both notice this thing standing behind her back fence and looking up into her kitchen window \(from a distance as the window isnt just right there.. you get me? Its a two story house, kitchen upstairs\).   
Now it's dark as fuck, street lights aren't lighting this area, but the moon is directly behind whatever this is and that's how i see it's features. It was very slender, muscular and resembled a fly's mouth and eyes. The body looked sort of human, but it seemed like it was just pure lean muscle. It had hair or some sort of shit, it looked like a Mohawk.  
Some reason we didn't stop walking when we saw it and now we are standing face to face \(about 3 meters distance between us\) and I can't see shit cause the moon isn't catching anything. I had my flip phone out and was trying to see it more clearly \(fail..cause i'm using a flip phone\), honestly my mind was just in ""wtf"" mode and I couldn't process anything else. It couched down, and I could see it was coming towards us, but I couldn't make out a head, face or a body, it just seemed like a blurry brownish mass coming straight at me. At this point my friend started walking backwards and telling me to run, but it was like i was just frozen in a state of confusion. I'm standing next to a tree, next minute I hear 2\-4 loud thumping sounds from what I imagine is coming from it's foot and then something jumped into the tree right next to me, all the leaves rustle and shit, my friend is freaking the fuck out, then we hear really loudly wings taking off and it's jumped out of the tree and must of fucking flew off, that's when we both run for our lives. We kept looking behind us, but I don't think it followed, and if so, we didn't see it. We both have never seen it again. I'm not sure what I seen, I haven't been able to find anyone that has seen the same thing. All I know is that it's body was lean, very muscular, it had a fly like mouth, eyes, hair like a Mohawk and we had caught it looking into the girls kitchen window from behind her back fence. I've googled the moth man and watched some stuff on it, but the description I read or the video gives doesn't feel like what I saw, but the fact that I knew it flew off and we heard swooping of the wings as it took off makes me believe it could fly, although I never saw wings on it when I had seen it's face and body. This happened in Australia, NSW on the South Coast in a small town that is surrounded by beaches. ",0
Fighting back?,"lets say, hypothetically that I was regularly visited and/or abducted and experienced what one would call invasive or even sadistic experimentation. would trying to fight back even be worth the effort? or am I better off just suffering through it and trying to live a normal life? are such violent visits common? why would any one particular person be selected & objected to this? Why me?        ",0
Just a general question,"Hi all,

I apologize if anyone has answered this before. But, I was randomly thinking this morning. How does alien abduction work exactly? Like, what I mean is when they bring you to a ship and you're inside, do you go through the ceiling or window? Wouldn't someone in the house wake up at the sound of a broken window?

I'm not a skeptic, I'm actually open. I just randomly thought of the question this morning and was wondering if anyone has explained it before.",0

Describing the Tall Man,"The Tall Man is a very frequently recurring figure in my abduction/interdemensional events.  Here I will describe the entity's appearance and behavior.  I believe this entity does exist and based on many encounters with it.

The Tall Man is an abomination.  It may be the same man seen over and over again in many different situations or it may be many different nen who all look and act alike.  

Appearance: almost exactly like the descriptions of the Men in Black and the Slenderman.  Tall and exceptionally skinny.  About 9 feet or more tall.  Pale white skin.  Wears a black suit.  Very clean and slow moving.  Raspy voice. Odd manner of speech with word repetition or sing-song words.  Threatening.  Lacks energy- usually sitting in a chair or standing still.  I often had experiences where I called him ""the Leader"" because it seemed the other entities were worshipping him with people also crawling on the ground to bring him pieces of paper.

Once I had an interdemensional event where I was seeing a group of men looking like this and called them ""the Elders"".  There were about 6 of them in the event.  All of them pedophiles.  This I knew through telepathy.  They are pedophiles.  

Personality and behavior: Sadism.  Ablity to brainwash.  Dislikes motion and activity.  Likes pedophilia and rape.  The being or beings rapes with it's fingers.  Performing surgical experiments and mutilations upon victims.  Deception.  Obsessive in stalking.  Controlling.  Hides. Hunts victims.  Preference for children and females as victims.  Can contact victims with just voice without actually appearing.  I believe the entity can ""possess"" victims in a way like indwelling them in a parasitic sort of way.

I believe the Tall Man is the being I once heard saying ""I'm going to kill you kill you"".  This is probably because I am aware of him and have been victimized by him as well as seen him victimizing others.  

The entity I am describing is very similar to what people describe from encounters with the *Men in Black*

I had something of a strong warning dream once, i don't think this was necessarily an abduction thing but more of a  dream warning, in which I saw myself and a young Asian girl running around the side of a highway.
2 of these Tall Men in a classic white Lincoln we're driving the road luring kids into their car.  While we were screaming out ""*you'll never come back, you'll die, they'll kill you if you go with them*."" But kids were still getting in the car.    ",0
"Pennsylvania Aliens and ""dream"" worlds","while UFO and alien sightings were happening in Pennsylvania my dad was a kid and as a kid he told his mom about seeing little fuzzy men in his window and had on going dreams about a place called Tigerlily. I've been trying to find anything i can about this place and if anyone else has had similar experiences but i haven't been able to find anything, I'll trt getting more details of the world and add them in when i can, but if any of you have heard or Tigerlily or seen the Little fuzzy men it would be amazing to hear your experience so i can see how  much of it is related.

Terrifying noise,"I won't get into this too much because I don't feel too comfortable writing about this, but I had a dream where I was abducted and there was one thing that petrified me. It was this unbearable noise on the space ship. Very, very loud. It kind of sounded like those electricity boxes where you can kind of hear the humming, but so much louder. So loud to the point where I had to put hands over my ears and even then it didn't make it any quieter. Like a mix of a swarm of bees and electricity all combined. Does anyone else have a similar experience? The aliens also gave me some clues and words but like I said I wanted to talk about the noise and keep the rest to myself.
I was hoping somebody could relate. Thank you for reading

"Grey Alien in Projection, Astral Dimension People","Hello everyone, here's my little story about some footage that was projected on the carpet through my brain by some astral dimension people. The footage I saw was never to be found on the internet.

The Waiting Room,"So I wake up in this dark room, there's people in there with me and none of us can get out. We are all absolutely terrified. We can hear a man screaming in the distance ""WHAT ARE THEY DOING TO ME"". He sounded so scared, he was screaming as hard as he could. Nobody wanted to look at eachother. The door opens and there's a tall lanky silhouette standing there. 

I wake up in my bed on my stomach, I never sleep on my stomach, it's painful. There's a really loud thought in my head telling me not to look, if I don't look at them, they won't know. 

I'm so lost. What the Fuck happened. Had anybody had anything similar to that? ",0
Any similar cases?,"Hey guys I'm new to this thread. I had an encounter about 3 months ago with another kind. I'm unsure if it was a full abduction as the room was the same as my bedroom except some things had changed (ie. The curtains were now open and there was a blinding light coming through my window). The beings I encountered were not the typical Alien ""Grey's"", these were more biologically proportioned to that of a human being. However, they were translucent. Much like a shadow but more grey in tone (I do have knowledge of the ""shadow people"" but the light is what makes me think they were more likely extraterrestrial). These beings were also not entirely bound to our laws of physics as they passed through my bed without any kind of resistance. In total there were 5 entities, the tallest of which was around 7ft tall and the shortest (who I perceived to be the leader) was only 4-5ft tall. This leader then proceeded to reach outbid arm as if you touch my face and I blacked out (maybe some kind of psychic power?). 
After this encounter I had a migraine that persisted for a number of days. 
Was hoping someone on here could shed some more light on these beings. Perhaps some of you have met the translucent beings yourself. And maybe you can tell me what they wanted with me?

Thanks,

Odd Childhood Dream Memories,"Putting this out there, in case it sounds familiar to anyone else; some fragments/associations from a dream, in the order they happened, that have stayed with me for years since early childhood (age 4 or 5)- maybe nothing at all, but in case not:

-""Skeletons"" coming (as in a gliding motion) through the walls, while ""chattering their teeth""/ high-frequency clicking sounds

-Sitting in a aqua-colored bowl-like area, almost like a huge circular swimming pool emptied of water; above is utter black, vague other ""skeletons"" also sitting (in a circle inside the ""bowl"", no seats, just facing in with knees bent, hunching forward a little). I hear a constant noise that sounds like [tires on a steel grate bridge](https://youtu.be/-_thhcuwEyY?t=73), and there is a smell like PVC (think brand-new shower curtains, beach ball inflation nozzles, etc.)

-Being with other children my age, all of us given a sort of object-puzzle to solve as a test; surroundings/light very dim, ""brown"" and non-defined. I solve the object-puzzle first, and try to show the other kids how, but I ""hear"" in my head the idea that my intelligence is good, but am too disruptive/""aware"", I should not be aware of/interfering with the other kids. I have a split-second picture of the ""boss/teacher"" (emotionless but STERN somehow), very tall, behind some podium-thing, wearing a dark gown/cape, her head/face like a praying mantis more than anything else. 

This is the only dream that's ever stayed with me to this degree of forcefulness of memory and detail, for this length of time; I'm in my mid-40's now, and I'm using my adult vocabulary as best I can to describe the dream that's stayed with me all this time. If any of this rings a bell, feel free to comment (or PM if you'd like to keep discussion ""off the air""). 

*Please note: I'm relatively open-minded, but do not subscribe to a number of popular narratives surrounding the subject, as I believe far too many people exploit the vulnerable for personal gain and/or self-aggrandizement, just as has always happened in everything from televangelism to loan-sharking.* ",0
I’ve been experiencing since I was very young.,"This is a long post and I apologize, but I really just wanted to reach out to a community/anyone that shares these experiences. 

Since I was little, I’ve had very strange and recurring dreams. The first one I can recall included nothing but a huge, swaying, spiky, blue ball. Swinging back and forth. I was four years old, and the feeling that those dreams gave me I still recall but can’t necessarily find the words to describe - they made me very anxious but somehow comforted me at the same time, and I would wake up almost in a trance. I would wake up and immediately walk to the kitchen to get a glass of water, and sit out in our back room, which had a large window over-looking a large field with rolling hills, and I would sit there from 5 in the morning until my mom woke up, around 7. I remember staring at the sky and often seeing shooting stars, but there are a few times that I remember seeing three large, dimmed lights in the sky, rotating in a circle. I can’t count how many times I’ve had that recurring dream, but I feel as if I had it every time I went to sleep when I was little. I slept with my mother until I was five, before I started school. She had the hardest time getting me to sleep in my own bed, or so she thought. I remember night after night for weeks, maybe months, I would fall asleep in my own bed easily, but I would wake up beside my mom in her bed every morning. She, and I, got very frustrated, as I would swear up and down that I did not walk into her room during the night to sleep. 

I was six years old and in school when I finally started sleeping in my own bed successfully, without waking up beside my mom. I started to get night terrors which I vividly remember. I experienced sleep paralysis, and still do. I would always hear growling, gargling, and a noise that sounded as if someone was scratching the underside of my pillow. I could physically feel myself fall into paralysis, as if someone was covering me with a very heavy blanket (I still feel this now, not sure if it’s normal for sleep paralysis), which is how I described it to my mom. I had a very large bedroom as a kid, with three giant stained-glass windows that would reflect cars’ lights as they drove by, and every night I would watch the lights fly across my room, but one night I woke up and the lights were so strong, beaming into my window, lighting up my entire room. I remember immediately having a feeling of terror, my mind was telling me to run away so fast, but I was nearly paralyzed. I remember a very low, constant humming, and watching my arms lift into the air with much physical restraint. That’s the last thing I remembering seeing, and suddenly my mother was walking into my room, broad daylight, apologizing because she had slept through her alarm and that I had definitely missed the bus to school. She offered to drop me off at school on her way to work. I remember rolling over onto my stomach and trying to get up, but I felt too weak. I couldn’t lift myself out of the bed. My mother thought I was faking because I didn’t want to go, and I couldn’t help but start crying in a panic. She walked over to my bed and took the covers off of me, revealing a body full of bruises - an abundance of tiny (dime-sized) blue and black bruises on my legs with a few large green bruises on my upper arms. We were both very confused and concerned, and we still bring it up to this day anytime we’re talking about our old house (a lot of strange things happened there - including TWO family members dying, one during Christmas dinner and the other during a backyard wedding we held). The bruises lasted for weeks - she had me wearing nothing but pants and long sleeves all the while, and I was sweating my ass off in the middle of May. Not long after this happened, I started to get sick, I went for constant tests and check ups, doctors explained that I had high methylmercury levels. I ended up being 6 years old with kidney failure, and I eventually lost one of my kidneys (I have one of those cool old-school scars that I brag about). Since then, I go for dialysis every once in a while and a lot of my levels are always whacked out (iron, blood cell counts, whatever you may) despite being on a very well-maintained, healthy and constant diet. They have been especially off lately.

I have many other strange and mysterious stories from many different times in my life - I’ll go over a few quickly. When I was just a little older, maybe 9, I was outside jumping on my trampoline after school. My neighbours dog came over and started barking viciously at me (or so I thought). I waited for the dog to leave, frightened, tail between legs, and ran for my front door (which was around my house from my backyard, up a small hill). I was met by what I thought was just a very tall, strange man, whose face I couldn’t make out, it was scrambled and incomprehensible. We stared at each other for a few seconds, and I turned around and headed for the side door (couldn’t catch a break!). As I was making my way back, I saw the man come towards me in what looked like a floating motion, and so I started to run. I was just a few steps down the hill when I felt a forceful push from behind and I fell down the hill. My neighbours dog came back and started barking again. My mom heard me screaming and came running down the hill, no one was around, but she saw the dog. My knee was torn up from the fall and the dog was still barking, and so my mom started to claim that the dog attacked me. I told her no, and that it was the large man that was out front. She told me there was no one around, and I was so confused. (She never held anything against the neighbour or their dog, which I loved and played with often). 

Skip a few more years into my adolescence, and more strange things occurred, I had two pet cats who I adored that went missing over night (separately - years apart), waking up with no open windows or doors, no one (that we knew of) coming in or out of the house at night. I had many nights of 12-15 hours sleep with no recollection of even going to bed. Waking up incredibly foggy, confused, going through entire days and not “coming-to” until hours after getting home from school, etc. One night I even woke up, around 4am, laying on my side, propping my head up with my hand, looking at a tv full of static, with my mom asking me what I was doing. That time, you could say, was the straw that broke the camels back. For some reason, that was when it really hit me how creepy these happenings were. I started to look into stories of abductions, alien conspiracy theories, anything I could find, spending hours upon hours of my days and nights obsessing over them. The occurrences became more frequent and tiresome, and so one day, after missing a few days of school in a row, “sleeping” for hours but never feeling rested, worrying my mom, I decided to bring it to a halt.

Cut to current day, we’ve moved twice since then, I’m 21 and as of recently I’ve been experiencing the same sleep paralysis situations, growling, gargling, scratching on my pillow, and the feeling of paralysis coming over me the second I close my eyes - my s/o jokes that he’s jealous that I can simply let me head hit the pillow and fall asleep but little does he know, I’m not waking up feeling rested at all. I began having the same recurring dream that I had when I was younger two weeks ago, and “came-to” staring out the kitchen into my backyard, full of forestry up to the property line, which is what pushed me to reach out to someone - anyone. I’m also having very, very lucid  and recurring dreams of strange, tall, feature-less beings (just like the man that was carousing around the front of my house that I swear pushed me down the hill) casually walking around my room, standing around my bed, and another one in which I’m standing in a field, on the beach, the parking lot at school, and I get “summoned”, for lack of a better word. My health is deteriorating rapidly, I’m always drinking water, eating correctly, exercising and I’m generally not hard on my body. My hair is thinning and falling out in clumps, I’ve noticed my nails are turning yellow, and I’m waking up with new bruises every day. At the gym I’ve been lifting heavier, doing less cardio, and I’m losing more weight and muscle than I ever have. I’m tired all the time because I’m having a hard time sleeping, I’m seeing the same numbers over and over again whenever I look anywhere, it’s always 444. Whenever I get up to use the bathroom or get some water during the night it’s 4:44, I leave college every day at 4:44, I flip to page 444 in my textbooks 8/10 times, even the other day my instructor told us to flip to inventory management in unit 4 - it was page 44. It’s driving me nuts. Am I crazy? Recently everything has been adding up, and I can’t tell anyone about it because of my fear of them telling me I’m crazy and overthinking. I’ve strayed so far from the abduction stories and alien information in general for so long, and I don’t know what made all of these experiences come back, but here I am.
 
Again, I’m sorry this post is so long. If you read the entire thing; kudos! Let me know if you’ve had any similar experiences, I know seeing the same numbers is common (and I’ve read other posts regarding it in this subreddit). Thanks for letting me vent, guys!

TL;DR I’ve been experiencing since 4-5, (seems like) I got abducted at 6, immediately got very sick and I’ve started to experience again recently. ",0
The blue light at my window,"I have a lifetime worth of memories of being abducted, and it does run in the family (a recent discussion with my aunt who I haven't seen in years has solidified that for me, coupled with discussions with my sister and grandfather).
But, I have a particular memory that I wanted to share with everyone here. 

*After the event told below, my own experience with abduction hyped up for about five years - I honestly believe I was being abducted a couple of times a week. It near ruined my life.*

One night when I was 14, I remember going to bed and having this sensation of ""knowing"". I'd experienced it before on occasion and I just knew that it meant I was going to be visited that night. Sometimes that realisation was terrifying, sometimes not. 

I went to bed, slept, etc.

Suddenly I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw something quickly move out of my eyesight at the end of the bed. I saw it, felt frightened, then ""forgot"" it was there. Like, I could see it but it just wasn't triggering my usual fear response. 

I got out of my bed, walked out of my room, and went to the bathroom. I'm a guy and I had a leak/pee. The whole time I was doing this I felt... Uncomfortable. I knew there was something in my room, but I just couldn't grasp it mentally. 


I finish peeing and walk back to my room. As soon as I open the door I am overwhelmed by a bright blue light. My bedroom window was a sliding door window that opened onto my backyard, and I lived semi-rural. It should have been pitch black. But instead my whole room was full of this bright blue light coming from outside. It was blinding.

Less than a moment after taking in the blue light I felt incredible pain on the back of my head - it's what I imagine being struck with a saucepan feels like. I black out. 


I wake up in bed, under my covers, with the pajamas I was wearing folded inside out at the end of my bed. Zero accessible memory of what happened from head pain till that moment. 


Things escalated pretty quickly from there (but died down a lot after puberty settled), but for some reason that might really stands out to me. ",0
I saw what they're really like,"One time when I was in their ""world"" or whatever it is...

I was 2 places at once.  One ""me"" was laying on a white raised bed/ operating table.  That ""me"" was absolutely lifeless.  The other ""me"" or I guess you could say my conciousness was hovering above right under the cieling, looking down at my lifeless body on the table, unable to do anything except feel because I'm outside of my body.

I see an empty room with 2 people besides me.  A tall, skinny man standing behind the operating table, my body laying right in front of him, and a beautiful, thin dark haired woman standing at the foot of the bed.  She is screaming uncontrollably.  

The evil man has her under his control telepathically.  The poor woman can't go anywhere.  I am watching from above in agony, not only because I am apparently dead and still concious, but because I can do nothing to save the woman.  I felt a strong attachment to the woman, like we were part of the same nation.  She was not a human woman.  I sensed she was a good person.  And the nice looking man was a monster.  
What I needed to do was destroy the man.  But I couldn't do so much as lift a finger.

He commanded the woman to ""give (max) her eyes."" I started to understand the bad man was killing her to give the dead body- me- some of her organs.  The woman was screaming so much she couldn't get a breath in.  She was also crying continually.  She said ""I am going to be sick"" and then appeared a huge white rubbish bin like a laundry hamper.  She was being sick constantly.  

This one happened months ago and has been emotionally catastrophic as have many, many other of these events.  So I feel like I have seen these other demensions people for what they really are which are primarily: parasites, vivisectors, racists, organ harvesters.  I'm not fooled anymore by the beautiful exteriors.  
The good ones, like the woman I saw, were just being cut up.",0

Wondering if I was abducted...,"This was about a month ago. It still perplexes me.

TL;DR: I think I might have gotten abducted by aliens. 

So about a month ago, my cousin gave me our family's ancestry paperwork that our grandma had kept. It was very interesting, apparently our family has been here in the US since the early 1600s and several of them fought in the Revolution.

That night, after receiving the papers, I had a very unusual dream.

In the dream, I was in the house we lived in when I was about 6 or 7, but I was an adult in the dream. My dad had gone out to the barn to do chores. He'd been gone for a while and dusk was approaching so I looked out the window to see if I could see him.

Right by our barn was a cluster of hardwood trees. I saw several Gray aliens sneaking through the trees towards the pasture. They seemed like they were in a squad formation: 2 in front, 3-4 in the middle, and 2 in the rear. Upon seeing them, I didn't exactly feel shocked, in my mind I was just like ""huh. So it's real. Ok.""

I went upstairs to get my brother. In real life, our house was only one story, but in this dream it had an upstairs. Anyway, I went up and told him there were Grays by the barn and we should go check on Dad. My brother had some weird body language going on, he seemed very physically uncomfortable. When I told him about the Grays he smiled a really weird smile and said he'd be down in a minute. I went downstairs and waited but he never came down so I went back upstairs.

He seemed even more physically uncomfortable, and then, like he lost control almost, he shapeshifted in front of me. 

He looked like some sort of Gray and Reptilian hybrid. He had mottled skin that had tiny scales all over it, the base color was a dark yellow/brown mustard color and the spots, mainly on his head and arms, were charcoal grey/black. He had several small bumps under his skin where his eyebrows should be. He had no eyelashes. His eyes weren't as large as a Gray's, but notably larger than a human's. His eyes were black with no pupil. His form was humanoid but he had a thick tail shaped like an iguana's.

I just kind of looked at him for a second then told him to come help me get Dad. He started to talk but his speech was very garbled and came out like a corrupted audio file. Midway through his talking, his eyes rolled back very sharply in his head, and they were white but had text on them. 

The text said ""If the audio on this being is corrupted the file needs adjustment"". 2 ""aliens"" who didn't look like Grays but didn't look like my brother either materialized and began working on my brother's head, seemingly adjusting the file. 

One of them said to me ""This won't take long"". But he didn't say it in words, he more ""thought it"" to me, I felt it in my mind.

Then all of a sudden I was in a different room. It was dimly lit and there was a table with 3 aliens who looked like the same ones who were working on my brother. There were papers all over the table, and I went and looked at them. It was my ancestry paperwork.

Again, they thought thoughts into my brain, I could feel their presence in my mind but it wasn't scary. What they ""said"" was: ""Verified"". Several times. And then I woke up.

When I woke up, I was in a very strange position. I was laying on my back, my back was arched up very far, my arms were somewhat crossed on my chest and felt very stifd, and my legs were bent with my heels digging very hard into the mattress. It was almost like someone put me back in bed and tried to bend my limbs back to normal.

I looked over at the clock and it was only about 45 minutes past when I had gone to bed. It was really strange because I never dream that early in my sleep.

So anyway. I don't know if it,was just the bizarre dream of a lifetime or if something actually happened. Thought you guys would enjoy the story though.",0
Bizarre talk show experience possible abduction,"I *think* I've been abducted into their demension and then returned to this demension over and over again.  I think they've got many different deminsions.  I've been mercilessly harassed all my life by these stupid whatever-they-are people.  By god I'm sick of it.

I know it all sounds crazy but the thing is, I'm not crazy.  I've had many sleep paralysis episodes but then I also have these episodes where I am in their demension.  They also have appeared here to assault me and I have heard their voices as well. I don't expect anyone to take my word for it but I still want to share.  I believe abduction is a real thing, not just a dream or a sleep paralysis or delusion.  This has been going on all my life.

The most recent time where I felt like I was in their demension: 
I was laying there paralysed but was hearing voices of people as well as applause.  My mind was able to ""tune in"" to watch what was going on even though I couldn't move myself.  

What I saw were 2 women on a stage like a tv set along with a man.  Lots of lights and an audience of people sitting in front of the stage.  The man was interviewing the women.  As I started to pick up on bits and pieces of what they were saying.

The second woman was speaking.  She had blonde hair, maybe they both did.  She spoke about how she'd received a child from the first lady.  Insane lady number 1 had gotten a ""troubled"" foster boy, hated the child, and passed the child onto Insane lady number 2.  Lady 2 starts talking about what a bad child/ burden the foster child is but she talks about how she's a martyr for ""saving"" the child.  The audience wildly applauds ladies 1 & 2.

It starts to dawn on me that I am the ""child"" they're talking about, even though I don't recognize any of these people.  

As Lady 2 speaks she sometimes does something very disturbing.  She puts her hands together and mutters weird unintelligible words while her eyes look up at the ceiling.  I somehow understand what she's doing.  Periodically these people stop speaking and make prayers and strange praises to their god.  Whoever their god is.  When they do this, clapping from the audience insues and some people are like crying and whatever.  These people are all batshit insane.

About 4 years ago I started having ""alien"" people appear in my room/house, most of them with extreme violence.  This occurred over a period of months with sporadic ""visitors."". One of the visitors was a fat blonde lady who called me ""so evil...""

I'm starting to think this is all connected.  So depressed because there's nothing I can do about it.  I worry constantly for myself and my family.  If I end up murdered, I'd want people to know that its the ""space people"" who did it.  They'd probably set it up to look like a suicide or like a regular murder but it's them behind everything.",0

Strange thing happened a while back,"Around 6 months ago, at night - around 10pm I believe I was on my computer at the time (Can't really remember any specific details) and then went to go lie in bed, I remember feeling incredibly agitated and restless.

I then remember hearing an incredibly unusual sound, sounding similar to a scream or a wail, it did not sound like it came from anyone in my house and I can't really accurately describe what it sounded like, it was something that terrified me and I recall being frozen in my bed and not moving at all. After this point I have a memory of suddenly standing upright in the centre of my room - as in, not consciously going from lying down to standing up, going instantly from having my eyes closed to standing up in the centre of my room.

I have never heard anything like the particular sound I heard before or after this event, I have also never had any prior experience with sleepwalking and I cannot remember anything that happened after the events that I described.",0
Saw him at the window. Now a visceral hate/fear/fascination with greys.,"When I was little my TV watching was very restricted. I wasn't allowed to watch any scary shows. One night I felt something looking at me through my window, and I went up to the curtains, opened them quickly and I will never forget the face I saw. It was gone in an instant. Years later I saw on a show what an alien looked like and i knew I immediately hated it. My body just froze. The same reaction I had when I saw the one at my window. Even masks at Halloween upset me if they are too realistic to what I saw. All I know is that I didn't trust what I saw and that it was bad. That's all I got from it. It wasn't good. A week later from when I saw it my sister screamed from the garage and she reported seeing a similar description watching her, I hadn't told her the story because she was littler and I didn't want to scare her. Sometimes I joke it's because we had high IQ's back then and they were tracking us and now that my IQ has probably plummeted they gave up on me. That was in the 80's and now I am still afraid at night they will come back for me. My sister, now a psychology major, said aliens represent the unknown in dreams. I have recurring nightmares. The other day I had one where I was in my old bedroom in 1989 and I was laying on the floor and about 4-5 of them were dragging me off. I could hear their feet running and their cold, clammy hands grabbing me. I don't know how to move on from this. I am thinking hypnosis to find out if it really happened - has that helped anyone? ",0
Strange encounters all my life has this happend to anyone else?,"So I had a very bizarre encounter I've never really been able to explain I've never posted much about it on any paranormal forms or anything like this but I'm kind of tired of Googling and not really finding much besides crazy conspiracy. And I was wondering if anyone else has ever had anything like this ever happen to them and what it was like. So I was about 5 or 6 when this first happened, I was sleeping in my room when I was woken up and I don't remember much but I do remember being led by my hand by a tall glowing creature to a large object out by my childhood home. I was found by the next morning in the laundry room wrapped in my blanket from my bed the door wasn't opened and my little brother was still in our room, werid but still explainable I had a bad dream and went and hid as small kids often do. So I didn't think much of it, then around the time I was 10 I remember seeing strange crafts when I was outside on a bike ride one day following me home from school. I never once felt threated by them, they were big glowing red balls of light. I had many UFO sightings like this and always wondered what they were, but never thought much of them. Untill I was 23 and I had two sightings and one encounter that made me believe that something is going on that I don't understand. I was laying in bed in my apartment and my girlfriend was watching TV in the other room, I was going to bed earlier then normal because I had work the next morning. I was just laying there unable to fall asleep playing with the cat when all the sudden I fell in to what only I could discribe as a trance state again I know this wasn't a dream because I was wide awake (damn insomnia) and suddenly in this trance I saw in my room and could hear this six and a half foot being made up of entirely light his body would change colors and gave off such a feeling of Hope and just generally good feelings. This however was terrifying to me because I was just sitting in my room but I was in awe and unable to move and before I was able to stand up and run to the door to grab my baseball bat. I heard in a clear voice do not be afraid I mean you no harm I come to merely see how you're doing it's been a long time. I asked him who he was and what he was doing here? This is when it gets really weird. But before that happened I snapped out of this trance because I heard my girlfriend yelling from the other room oh my God, get in here there's something outside and she ran into the room and threw open the door when I turned around to see if the creature was still there it was gone. So I got up and ran out to the porch where she said there was something out there we lived on a second story apartment building right by Lake Lansing I looked out over the balcony and could see off in the distance does big ball of red light that moves slowly and silently. I told her what had happened and she goes no way and she told me that the light or craft or whatever it was was just gliding around the porch a few minutes earlier silently making no noise stopped in the middle of the air and she was able to even get a good look at it and see that it wasn't a drone it wasn't a plane or helicopter like I had suggested. I was looking for some reason to disprove what I just seen I had no idea what had happened and couldn't believe it. Then a few weeks later I was on the porch smoking a cigarette around dusk and I looked off over the lake and noticed something out of the corner of my eye floating around the building almost up to my balcony was this small ball of red light that changed size and got then floated towards the river and shot off. I reported it to mufon because I saw they had this sighting map and I saw that many people in my area reported similar sightings around the lake. other werid shit I saw there was once I saw 3 hilcoptors after a seeing a strange disk shaped object in broad daylight. After moving out of that place I still have no idea what I saw what happened and why even to this day I still see strange things in the sky that I can explain. I think it's worth noting because it a lot of these stories always sounded like some hostile Force is coming to get us or experiment with us never once have I ever felt threatened by an object or by an entity in fact it seems like they want to help us but it's hard to say for sure because these are just speculations.",0
My Possible Abduction,"Before I tell my story, just saying that I'm 13, so I might sound awkward at some points. My story was a week or so ago. It was only for about a second that I remember. I woke up, and I felt like I was sleeping in a car, uncomfortable but yet oddly fun. I felt a feeling I've never felt before, I just felt light. Not exactly, but closest to that feeling you get when you can droop your shoulders and relax. I saw one of my classmates and I remember that part precisely, and we were in this bluish room. (I haven't told him, that would be weird as hell) I wouldn't call it blue, because it wasn't exactly blue. It's  probably one of those things humans do to compare something they've never seen before to something they have. He was knocked out. There were other people my age around, that I didn't notice because of the angle I was at, but we were all in sections like a classroom. The room was lit. So, people were all around me in rows, and I noticed that we were all naked, and there were these clear boxes a bit bigger than the average head, that were on our lower bodies and I could feel my private part being touched in a nice way, and I wasn't touching myself. The last thing I remembered was that good feeling, if you know what I mean, and I woke up. The thing is, you might think this is a wet dream, but I checked and my underwear was clean. This wasn't the only incident. A year or two ago, there were lights that my two parents saw as well. This was amazing to see, and I know anyone that loves space and the idea of aliens would like to hear this. It was a bunch of lights going by, making no noise. These lights were going by slowly, each the size of a street light if you looked straight up at it, and the color of street lights. But remember, we weren't even in a car or moving, and I was probably 12, so it's not like both my parents were drunk and told me this story, I was there. We all witnessed it, and if the FBI interrogated us about it this instant, we would all be able to recall it the same way without the other's help. These lights took at least 5-10 minutes to finally pass by. We were too amazed to get a camera and take footage. My dad had the idea, but honestly, if you were there, would you really want to possibly miss the biggest moment in your life for a few views on YouTube and then dislikes and hate comments saying it's fake? Although. I feel extremely sad that people that professionals that believe in aliens probably won't believe us since we don't have actual proof. Well, before you talk about how fake that incident is, think about planes. Planes aren't even 1/100th the size of a ship that takes over 5 minutes to cross the sky, and they make a hell of a lot more of noise. So no, it wasn't some airplane. Also, I believe the reason this happens around here is because our town's population is only around 500-1,000 and barely anyone comes around here on purpose, and I'd guess that highly advanced alien technology probably would be aware of that, to an extent at the least. I honestly think-No I BELIEVE that the incident of the spaceship was real. I don't know about the second one, but I remember these things like the back of my hand, which to be honest, I don't do for most things. I'm really reaching out to you guys, because I'm too embarrassed to tell my parents about the last incident. How would you even tell your parents something like that? ""I think me and a bunch of other kids got abducted and our sperm was possibly used."" No thanks, maybe at the right time I will but it would be so awkward, and they'll probably think I'm high or something. A side note; I'm the kid that you didn't notice was absent at school because I'm so quiet, and I normally don't find the weird joys most people have that cause them to erupt with happiness, and I really didn't give two craps about space before I saw the lights, but after, I'm not even kidding, I'd spend days without sleeping reading articles about aliens and possibly being able to see aliens or just even space in my lifetime. And I'm a 13 year old boy in the 21st century, I should be more amazed with playing video games, and even I find it weird. Another add-on: I don't actually remember much before I saw the lights, except for my 8th birthday and some creepy giant praying mantis I saw at a park when I was a toddler. Also, I realized that my typing speed and grammar is great for my age, WPM 85-95 (highest being 101), since I don't remember much about before the lights, I don't even know if I had this talent before. I'm editing this in, but also I get a ringing in my ears in the afternoon, which is just loud enough to be annoying but just quiet enough for me not to go insane. It's pretty weird, considering I'm a kid that can type faster than most of the people that read this. Another thing is that sometimes, I want to say something, but there is no word in the dictionary for it. It's so weird. I usually have to use a metaphor to explain what I mean if there isn't a word for it. When I have a piece of paper and I'm bored, I just let go of my hand and it just moves, making weird symbols. I feel like if I was in someone else's body, that I wouldn't feel as tense in my body all the time. Whenever I'm around people I'm not comfortable with and I look at them for a while, my eyes hurt, and they feel strained, like after watching hours of TV non-stop. I don't have bug eyes and I don't bulge my eyes, but at school that happens a lot to me. About the typing thing, I have an idea. This might sound stupid, but is it possible that aliens use something similar to computers and in some way, this affected me or I was used and that's why I type faster than 80% of the population (Once again, I'm only 13!)? I don't know, I probably sound like a complete idiot, so I'm going to end it here. Sorry for taking up your time if this sounds stupid. You can yell at me through the screen for being such an annoying cockroach.",0

Buddha GrandMaster Talks About Alien Agenda,"Hi All,

I have some lecture excerpts that you might be interested in. It's from a Buddha Master from the Falun Dafa school of QiGong. A very high level cultivation technique that is very righteous and powerful:

http://www.falundafa.org

I recommend checking this out, especially the book 'Zhuan Falun':

https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/pdf/ZFL2014.pdf

Wow what a read, it covers so many things, from the mysteries of the microcosm to the macrocosm, other dimensions, the soul, ancient prehistory, supernatural latent abilities, chi, gong energy and so many other things.

This practice is also being severely persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party with practitioners being sent to concentration camps, tortured, there organs sold on the black market and often killed:

http://en.minghui.org/cc/1/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvAOOwvJMZs

In these following lecture excerpts, the founder of Falun Dafa, Mr Li hongzhi spells out the Alien Agenda that is upon this earth and it's implications to humanity as a whole.

The rest of the lectures that have been given around the world can be found here:

http://www.falundafa.org/eng/books.html

Also Mr Li Hongzhi has been interviewed by Time Asia, another fascinating read:

http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2053761,00.html

But in closing, here are the lecture excerpts on the Alien Agenda that is taking place on our planet, I hope you will find them of interest.

“Let me first explain what alien beings are all about. You know that this Earth isn’t the only planet with life in this universe, and Earth hasn’t existed just this once. I’m saying that at Earth’s position there were Earths that existed before. Those previous Earths were discarded. Some exploded. It happened many times—the number has been quite large. The final stage of an Earth has always been a time when its lives were the most corrupt and its matter was the most impure, so the Earth could no longer be kept. It would be eliminated since the whole sphere had turned into a ball of karma.

The reason is, lives reincarnate . They reincarnate into soil, rocks, plants or matter, and regardless of what they are reborn as, they carry karma with them . Earth would become a ball of karma when karma was all over the place, so at that point it would be eliminated. There would still be some people on Earth who were relatively good, and those exceptionally few or extremely few ones were taken and placed onto another planet within the Three Realms.

Yet through the ages this Earth has been replaced innumerable times and each time there were people who remained. So over time those remaining lives increased in number. The gods in each time period created humans with a different appearance, so the differences are quite substantial, and there are some who were created on other planets. These are alien beings. They’ve become like a record of history , placed there like a page of history left behind . That’s the function they serve, a minor one. They were left behind from the final stage of Earth during those times, and took with them the technology they had in those times over to other planets, so their starting point was more advanced.

Over this long period of time, the knowledge of the universe they came to grasp far exceeds that of the inhabitants of today’s Earth. Their bodies can enter other dimensions and adjust to the mode of those dimensions they are in; they ’ve developed to this stage. Those things they ride in that fly back and forth—those aircraft that human beings call flying saucers—can enter other dimensions and fly into other space-times. If they travel in a fast space-time, after being there for just a short while they traverse a long distance. So that speed is inconceivable to human beings. The types of fuel they use aren’t in the least the kinds of substances conceivable by the technology, theories, or concepts of modern science.

Over the ages, these alien beings have continually been developing and metamorphosing. So in this universe there have really appeared the abnormal social relations that these kinds of lives have. Greed and lust have caused something like star wars to actually happen over where they live. They haven’t yet threatened humankind because humankind doesn’t have the ability to pose a threat to them . So they haven’t attacked humankind.

They would attack humankind if you were to threaten them. Although alien beings haven’t attacked humankind, they know that a human body is the most perfect. They’ve thus taken a fancy to the human body and want to steal it. They saturate all domains of humankind with science to make human beings firmly believe in science and rely on it. When human beings ’ thoughts and way of existence are completely assimilated to theirs, they just have to replace people’s souls and humans will become them, and they will eventually replace the human race.

It’s a long story. They have been coming here full-scale since the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution in the West. They ha d come prior to that time, but they didn’t control people then. Their full-scale arrival began when Caucasian society entered the industrial age. They made full preparations and systematic arrangements for occupying this earth. It was they who created science for human beings . So this science was set up by aliens. Their purpose was to unify human beings and simplify their thoughts to the point of being as uniform as machines. And they unified knowledge to make it easy for them to later on control and replace human beings. Furthermore, they’ve chosen a few nationalities as the vanguards of their future, total control of humankind. Japan is the vanguard that drives technology.

The United States is the vanguard in breaking away from all ancient cultures o n earth. The cultures of even the most ancient and closed-off nations haven’t been able to escape. The whole world is being impacted by America’s modern culture. England was the vanguard in the manufacture of machinery during the early stages , and Spain was the vanguard for mixing the human races. The way alien beings get human beings to shake free of the gods is to mix the races, causing human beings to become rootless people, just like the plant hybrids people make nowadays. South Americans, Central Americans, Mexicans and some people in South East Asia— all of these races have been mixed. None of this can evade the gods’ eyes. Alien beings have made rather extensive preparations for overtaking human beings.

Everyone who know s how to operate a computer ha s been registered. Of course, our students don’t have this problem. Once you obtain the Fa, I clean up that layer of your body that’s been occupied by them. They have formed a layer of their body within the human body. It’s incredibly frightening! Everything people learn from elementary school right up through college is the science they brought , and everything that human beings use nowadays is the product of this omnipresent science. Why do the inspirations people get make computers and technology develop with such tremendous speed? It’s done by that layer of the body that alien beings formed so as to control the human race. It’s exactly because that system of their technology and science that has formed in the human body is making people’s minds do so.

Today it’s incredible how developed computers are. But it is not a human technology. Man will be replaced by alien beings if it continues like this for long. But think about it, everyone: Alien beings are, after all, beings within the Three Realms, where ordinary humans are. There are other reason s why they dare to do this sort of thing. It has happened because the Fa of the universe has deviated and gods no longer look after things.

So it has to do with high-level beings as well. If this situation is to be turned around, it has to begin from high levels. That’s because they have this idea that human beings are no longer any good, their morality has degenerated, and everything is perverted. So they think it’s all right to just replace them , given that they are going to be eliminated all the same. They have to pay for all of the bad things they’ve done, for sure. The principles of this universe are absolutely reasonable toward any life.

So they have to answer for everything they’ve done. As for how their lives will eventually be dealt with, alien beings definitely won’t exist in the future. If there are truly good ones among the alien beings, then their lives can reincarnate as other lives. Bad lives will be eliminated. So everything that every being does positions himself for the future . And that includes all human beings. Whatever a human being does positions him.

That’s the situation as far as alien beings go. They are being swept out up there, and they found out about the cleaning, so they scurried over here, and in particularly large numbers in recent years.

As of right now, most of the alien beings who have come here did so fleeing for their lives. They knew that in the end it would be hard for them to escape, so some alien beings have married Earth dwellers. But it’s not that they marry legitimately, because no one would marry them. They catch a village woman to leave behind their offspring. And there are those who are hiding among ordinary people. They can’t stay under cover no matter how they hide. Immense gong is coming up from the microscopic level.

Whether it be steel, iron, wood, the human body, water, rocks, air, plants, animals, substances, etc., from the microscopic level of everything gong is coming up toward the surface. Tell me, where could they escape to? The gong is omnipresent and rushing up to the surface . So they’ve seen that there is no way to dodge it or to hide from it. How do they exist? The y aren’t actually possessing spirits. But some of them have assumed man’s appearance and walk the streets . You have no idea who they are.

Some have hidden and don’t come out. But the number is now small, very small. In the past they could hide , and their flying saucers could fly up and go to another dimension. But the other dimensions have all been cleaned up. Immense gong is rushing here and they can no longer hide. They can only hide in a cave or at the bottom of the sea in this dimension. Even so, they can’t stay concealed. Anyway, that’s the problem they face . All lives are positioning themselves in this affair. You should know that although alien beings brought their science to human beings to achieve their goals, gods are in charge of everything and are in turn using them.”

“Having seen many movies, having read many imaginative stories, and having been influenced by a lot of things in society, people have developed a warped mindset that indulges in fantasy. You asked how to communicate with intelligent beings. Let me tell you all that an ordinary person can’t do that sort of thing, and he lacks the ability. If you could indeed communicate with intelligent beings but weren’t a cultivator yourself and were without energy, you would be in danger. You might lose your life any moment. Besides, you would see gruesome spirits but no high-level beings, for your level would be too low and limited to only that of humans. So it would be a terrifying situation. It’s even more terrifying if you want to communicate with living beings beyond Earth.

Lives beyond Earth are just lives on other planets within this physical dimension that our human eyes can perceive. Yet those lives don’t regard people as human beings. They think people are beasts, a kind of animal. They slaughter people at will and experiment on you at will. They kidnap people to their planets, lock them in cages, and put them on display as animals. Many of Earth’s people who have gone missing were taken by them. I can also tell you that today’s human science was created by them. Why have those aliens created for humans something like the current science? It’s because what they have on their planet is akin to it.

They want to bring it to this planet and eventually replace humans. They found that the human body is really perfect, flawless. So they covet the human body and want to eventually replace humans. They have added their things into one layer of human beings’ molecular cells. That’s already been done now and it has formed on a large scale. So for me to save you today, I not only have to remove all the attachments and karma that you need to eliminate, but I also have to clean up this stuff for you. The road humankind is travelling down is dreadful. Computers would have commanded people one day. Ongoing developments have conformed to this trajectory. Humans were to become the slaves of computers and machinery, and eventually be replaced by aliens.

Why have computers developed so quickly, and why has the human brain suddenly become so “sharp”? All of this has been carried out by aliens controlling the human mind. Aliens have registered everyone who knows how to operate a computer. For real. As to our students, I’ve cleaned all of that up for them, so that they won’t be interfered with by aliens when they use computers. Why are there aliens? Some aliens originate from their planets. Why do some aliens always come to Earth? It’s because they were once humans on Earth. But it wasn’t the Earth of our time. It was the previous Earth that existed at the same location as this Earth. Earth has been replaced many times.

Each time it was replaced, there was a portion of lives—living beings created by gods with different appearances, some of whom were similar to today’s humans, some of whom had different forms who were relatively good at the time and were thus preserved. They weren’t destroyed, yet they weren’t allowed to enter the period of human development on the next Earth, either. So they were sent to another planet. That’s how it was done every time. Also, it has left a record of this universe, for they were humans on Earth in different time periods. It serves that purpose. But due to a slackening in overseeing them, they have developed, and they have created all kinds of scientific methods according to their schemes; some are like the kind on our earth, some assume other forms, and there are a variety of modes of development. Of course, they don’t use the term “science.”

The names they use belong to their languages and concepts. These things have deteriorated further and further. And with the deviation of the cosmos’ Great Fa, the aliens have become worse and worse too. That’s why all aliens are in the process of being completely eliminated. They are being eliminated throughout the entire universe. At present, those up there have been eliminated. What’s left are only those who have escaped to Earth, who are mingling among people or who have attached to human bodies. And there are other types too.”

“As you know, modern science was brought to mankind by aliens. They came when the Industrial Revolution began in the West. They started with mathematics and chemistry—started from the shallow, simple knowledge of the earliest days—and penetrated on through to modern machinery, and eventually they developed up to today’s computers. As development continues further their ultimate goal will be to replace human beings.

How is the replacement to take place? As I mentioned, in the body of today’s human beings almost everyone has a layer of the body that was created by aliens. Why do I say that? It’s because all of the science that they instilled in you has created a warped human mindset in your mind. There have never been humans like this in any of mankind’s previous civilizations. When the mind is like that, so is the body. As you know, every cell in your body is you, and your brain is connected to the brain in every cell. In that case, the thought processes inside the countless cells in your body are all the thoughts of warped human beings, and the entire body has become like that. This ties into why gods no longer regard man as human. When mankind is no longer human, what is the point of gods’ saving it?

You know that when a person dies, he doesn’t really die. The shell of the layer of the largest molecular particles sloughs off, whereas the part of the body composed of microcosmic particles below molecules hasn’t died. It is separated, as if a person takes off a piece of clothing. It isn’t really dead. Yet the person in this dimension has vanished, since the body needs to be cremated or buried and it will eventually decompose and dissolve. It has departed from this dimension; that is, this layer of particles has disappeared.

Then, as to the alien culture that I was just talking about, it is precisely using man’s own thinking to create the bodily layer that it needs, and it is doing so without man being aware of it. How will they ultimately replace human beings, then? You know that they still have to find a way to replace the shell of the outermost surface of human beings. This is the method of “cloning” that man now wants to use. Gods look after people, and when they don’t look after someone, they won’t instill the elements of life into that person.

This is to say, the reason you are alive in this world is not that you have this flesh body, nor is it because your mother gave you this body that you are alive. It is because you have your main spirit (yuanshen) and the existence of all of your other spirits (shen) that you can live. Why doesn’t a person keep living after he dies and the body is laid down there, since it’s the same body after all? It’s because all of his main spirits have left. That is, if a person isn’t given a spirit and isn’t allowed to reincarnate at the time of birth, he will still be dead after he is born. So what will happen? Aliens will enter.

This is the ultimate means that aliens will use to replace man— that is, cloning humans. Man is being used by aliens to destroy himself, yet he is not aware of it and is still protecting this science, destroying the human race. If humans are cloned en masse in the future, those beings will all be aliens that have reincarnated in human bodies, and there will be no more human race.”

I’ve told you before that because of alien science and technology, one layer of the human body, one of the human body’s layers of particles, has been placed fully under the control of aliens. It consists entirely of alien planets’ elements, including numbers, mechanical structures, electronic components, and so on. It consists of that stuff. And those things are continually creating a warped effect. The large-scale modern industries brought about by science have impacted many low-level dimensions in the cosmos. In my Fa-rectification I’ve found that quite a large layer of the cosmos has been contaminated by those things. And those warped things have had a considerably large resisting effect in the Fa-rectification.

Possibility of alien abduction during early childhood?,"When I looked up this [list](http://humansarefree.com/2015/01/72-possible-signs-of-alien-abduction.html), I noticed that several points apply to me, namely:

- LOST TIME: As a young boy, during the night. I have two detailed memories. Once, I tried to fall asleep; suddenly, time ""skipped"" to morning, the dark window became lit by the light of the sun and I could leave bed. Another time, I was lying in bed and my nanny said goodnight; as soon as I closed my eyes, I could hear her waking me up! Both times, I wasn’t really tired and the time jump was fully conscious!

- TAPPING OR HUMMING NOISES: I hear lots of strange noises in my ears after turning off the bedroom lights - various hums and ringing. Usually, it doesn't stop me from falling asleep eventually.

- FEELING OF BEING WATCHED: Sometimes, when I'm alone.

- UNABLE TO SLEEP: Sometimes, frightening thoughts about aliens keep me awake for a long time. In bed, I feel the urge to look up and check the whole room to see if somebody is inside.

- PARALYZED IN BED: Sometimes, my body refuses to move for several seconds.

- DREAMS OF FLYING: Used to have them with great frequency, I still have them rarely. The flying movement is usually equivalent to swimming in a shallow pool - I am standing up, I willingly ""jump"" up and begin swimming through the air using arm strokes. Usually, I stay close to the ground, but sometimes, I swim up to reach great heights, where my dream ends. The flying is always voluntary and not connected with paralysis. Some dreams abruptly end with a sensation of free fall (e.g. falling off a cliff).

- ""MISSION""/FEELING OF BEING ""SPECIAL"": Yes, I have a feeling that I am ""special"" and that I have some sort of objective.

- PSYCHIC: Sometimes, I know what will happen within several seconds or minutes. And I have had prophetic dreams at least twice in my life - one I can clearly remember is about the speech of my school's headmaster during an assembly. I often have Deja vu experiences.

- EYE DREAMS: I don't remember any dreams of large, black eyes, but I remember a dream about some sort of a disease which made one grow a third eye (when I was little). It was very scary, and I could not sleep for the rest of the night.

- STARTLED: I sometimes awaken in the middle of the night.

- PICTURES OF ALIENS: I get a negative feeling when seeing the picture of a grey. It's just uncomfortable; comparable to jumping into cold water.

- FEARS OR PHOBIAS: I have a mild fear of heights (e.g. pool jumps). However, what is probably more important is the fact that a certain buzzing sound mosquitoes make forces the muscles of my back to contract. This is one of the reasons I hate mosquitoes and sometimes stay awake for long hours in summer, refusing to go to bed until every mosquito in the rook is dead.

- KNOWING PEOPLE W/EXPERIENCES: I know one former Soviet Air Force pilot who claimed that he had seen various aliens (greys, ""energy beings"") and their technologies.

- BLOOD ON PILLOW: I see small blood traces on my pillow sometimes. However, it may come from scratching my face.

- INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT: I have always been interested in UFO's and aliens and like to browse conspiracy websites.

- FOG OR HAZE: I can not recall seeing fog or haze on inappropriate occasions, but I can admit that I have a strong phobia of foggy water and often refused to swim in pools with foggy water when I was a kid.

- NOSE BLEEDS: Very rarely (1-2 times a year) I have spontaneous nosebleeds.

- RINGING IN THE EARS: As already stated above. I hear ringing/tinnitus in one or both ears often, especially during bedtime.

- BEHIND YOUR EYE: I sometimes have headaches that feel like my brain is pressing against my skull and eyes and has not enough space.

- DIFFICULTY TRUSTING: Sometimes, I have difficulties trusting other people.

- DON'T TALK: I sometimes have this feeling. My parents and grandparents are very skeptical when it comes to these topics.

- SLEEP AGAINST THE WALL: When sleeping in a bed standing by a wall, I always sleep with my back facing my wall.

- LOCK ALL DOORS: In boarding school, I lock the door of my room at night.

- NO RECALL: I cannot remember anything directly related to aliens/abduction. If I dream of aliens (which happens VERY rarely), it is usually in a science fiction style that has nothing to do with abductions. Sometimes, I see UFO's in my dreams, however.

- COMPULSION TO STUDY ASTRONOMY/QUANTUM PHYSICS: I am very interested in anything that has to do with space and physics as well as in higher mathematics. I desire to study Aerospace Engineering.

- SEE SAME NUMBERS ON CLOCKS LINED UP: Sometimes, usually during the day. One time, I read an article about waking up at 3:33 and alien abductions - the next day (I was sleeping in a room with an electronic clock), I woke up at night and BAM - as soon as I forced myself to look at the clock, it showed 3:34, suggesting that I indeed woke up at 3:33. Couldn't sleep for the rest of the night due to fear.


I don't have dreams, but I have clear memories of the following things:

- An operation when I was a little boy. I clearly remember waiting at the hospital with my parents, being led to the surgery by a nurse who offered me to play with a toy car and having the anaesthesia mask fitted before breathing in the gas.

- Fireworks. My family lived at an enclosed residental park (a ""country club"") when I was small, and we bought fireworks often, even on non-festive days. We would light them when returning from the city and watch them together with the security guards at the entrance checkpoint. I also remember that my dad lit fireworks on my 3rd birthday in the house garden and that I was afraid and hid behind a car. I remember liking fireworks strongly.

I must say that my intelligence is above-average (according to a teacher, my IQ is ""at least 140"") and that I learned to read at a fairly young age. I always used to read the astronomy section of my childrens' encyclopedia and knew about rudimentary terms (""red giant"", ""galaxy"", ""black hole"") at preschool age. I started playing Microsoft Flight Simulator, Orbiter and KSP in primary school.

Pertaining to health problems - I have nasal polyps, but it seems to be getting better. In the last two years, I had calf cramps in spring, which could be treated by means of magnesium pills. Last summer, I had (unexplained) occurences of cystes inside/on the surface of the eyeballs, which caused reddening, itching, pain during eye movement and discharge of sticky tears that made opening the eye hard after waking up.


tl;dr: Many points from the ""72 signs"" list apply to me.

Do these statements point towards a possible alien abduction experience in the past and/or subliminal contact with aliens?",0
What just happened,"This morning I woke up at about 3:30 and unable to get back to sleep I stayed in bed on my phone. It was about 5:50 when I decided I should cut my losses and get up for the day, but then I was overcome with exhaustion and laid back down. I started dreaming but my mind was still awake, I wasn't scared at this point but I was trying to wake up. Failing to do so I then felt like I was moving fast, but staying still as if I were on a boat. I distinctly remember feeling like I was loosing my balance and then I stopped moving fast and fell into thick yellow water. I knew I was in liquid and was aware of the fact that I needed to breathe, but I no longer needed to. After that I heard an incredibly loud noise that got closer and closer until it stopped after that I don't remember much, I do however remember talking but was unable to understand it. Then, the deafening noise happened again but it was leaving this time. Once the noise was completely out of ear shot I was able to wake up. It was 6:00, but it felt like I was asleep for hours. Now, I am sitting alone in my apartment wishing my roommate wasn't going to be gone all weekend. Wtf just happened? ",0

Alien Encounter,"In mid November of 2017 I had a strange dream in which light surrounded me, and I was fully lucid. I mark my lucidity by tattoos (usually they aren't present), but my sleeve was fully visible in this encounter. What looked like a golden kidney bean glowed on the lower right side of my stomach, and I could feel a rapid amount of information enter my sphere of knowledge as I looked into what I can only describe as layers of translucent boards, filled with equations. As soon as I protested, a cheesy image of a joker face with a large smile and sharp teeth appeared on my wall and I woke up.

Since then, fragments of this experience have come back into my consciousness. I remember standing with about twenty people in a locker room, laying on a surface next to a brown headed boy as something was taken from my strapped arm. Though the strangest is one that S. R. speaks of in Extraordinary in which I was strapped to a spinning copper, puckered plate and could not move. I felt someone try to turn me over and take something, again, from my arm.
There were sightings of UFO's in the area I live in the same night this occurred. My boss also had the same dream.

Possible abduction?,"A few years back my gf at the time told me I had a weird mark on my lower back. I checked and it was rather odd. A series of evenly spaced spots in a pattern.

This was around a time in my life where for months I would wake up at 3AM every single day.

My First Potential Abduction,"Last night I experienced something I have never experienced previously. Before I share it with you I want to give you some background on myself.

I am a twenty-five year old guy living with my girlfriend. We have two dogs that sleep in bed with us. I tend to consider myself a normal guy. I don’t think of myself as someone who is obsessed with aliens/abduction theories. Something happened to me last night that made me question if aliens live among us.

It was around 11pm. My girlfriend was already asleep. The dogs were also asleep. For some reason they were not in the bed, they were both laying on the floor. I thought this was weird since they love to cuddle in between my girlfriend and I. I was not complaining though, they tend to take up the majority of the space on the bed.

I laid down on my stomach with my pillow under my head. I pulled out my phone and loaded YouTube to watch some random interesting videos before bed. I looked at a few videos before I came across one with Neil Degrasse Tyson. He was on a late night TV show talking about the one mystery that made him lose sleep at night. I will not go into detail but in summary, he mentioned that the universe was expanding and speeding up while doing so. He said that some of the galaxies that we study currently will not be visible to future generations. He also mentioned that because of this he believed that we may not be able to see things that were previously seen by our ancestors. 

I finished watching this video and decided to go to bed. I put my phone on my nightstand and laid my head on my pillow while still on my stomach. I placed my hands under the pillow as I continued to think of space and the idea of the unknown. I began to think about aliens and the probability of there being advanced civilizations that could travel to our world and communicate with us. 

The last thought that popped into my head was me thinking, “you know what, I wouldn’t mind communicating with aliens. I would love to learn what they could do that we still can’t. I bet it wouldn’t even be scary, just interesting”.

This is where the normal events stopped and the weird ones began.

I don’t remember progressively falling asleep. One moment I was having complete thoughts, and the other I was standing in my parents living room with my girlfriend. The following is my best description of what I will call “my dream”.

I was standing next to a Christmas tree in my parent’s living room. My girlfriend was sitting on the floor next to me unwrapping some gifts. I remember looking down at all of the gifts and thinking, “I did not buy her any of these. These look expensive”. I remember that one of the gifts was an old analog tv with the wheel you had to turn in order to change the channels. The tv was on but there was nothing but static. There was also a wooden baseball bat, an old sewing machine, and some other things that I don’t remember. 

I asked my girlfriend who the gifts were from. She looked up at me and said, “don’t worry about it, you and I didn’t pay for them”. I began to get upset because I wanted to know who had given us all of the gifts. I stated to raise my voice at my girlfriend, demanding that she told me who had given these gifts. 

As I raised my voice I remember the white noise coming from the tv became louder and louder. I could barely hear myself speak. I was having to yell in order to hear what I was saying. As I prepared myself to yell at my girlfriend once again, everything turned off. 

The lights in the house turned off. The television turned off. There was zero light coming through the window. I could not hear nor see my girlfriend who had been sitting at my feet. I did not think of calling out for her. I slowly extended my hand in front of me hoping to touch my girlfriend’s head. I felt nothing. Panic started to set in as I stood there in complete, dark, silence.

The feeling of panic immediately got worse as I remembered saying that I wanted aliens to show me what they were capable of doing. I panicked as I stood still in the darkness. 

From one second to the next I woke up in my bed. I was no longer laying on my stomach. I was laying on my back with my hands at my side. I was completely straight with the pillow perfectly positioned under my head. I looked over at my girlfriend and saw her sleeping in the same position as before. My dogs were also both asleep. I looked at the clock and it was now 4:47 in the morning.

I was not able to go back to sleep. I laid there in bed browsing through my phone until 6:30 at which time I got up for work. I have been doing some browsing regarding the subject but don’t know what to make of it. Hopefully someone on here can shed some light on it.

Abduction dreams,"So mainly I am a paranormal, spirits kinda girl but lately I have been seeing posts on abduction dreams and I wanted to get some feedback on the one and only dream I recall about it. 
I live with my bf of two years,  40 yr old male,  no history of any mental disorders etc ( me - 34 yr old female no mental issues either).... when we were dating about 6 months he told me of an incident about how he found a strange piece of metal/plastic? Buried under his skin when he was very young and he used to have strange dreams of aliens visiting him.. I figured he joking and forgot about it. 
Fast forward a year ( so it's approx 6 months ago) I had the strangest, most vivid dream where I'm in bed in our bedroom and wake up but everything looks like I'm viewing it through night vision ( in the dream I'm alone,  but bf works till 1am so makes since whether real or dream) . After awaking in the dream I see a tripod across the bedroom and walk over to it screaming and terrified....(i could feel their prescenc but could not see them.) .""I know your watching me,  leave me alone"" but there was no sound I could only scream it in my head and couldn't make a sound. .. then I wake up..but I woke up in the  same dream just in black n white not night vision. Then  I really woke up...
This was the most realistic,  scary dream I have ever had,  today it still freaks me out.  I never told the bf because he'd bust my chops but what really gets me is a week after the dream he saw a black triangle in the sky 2 times in a month, came home amped up, freaked n out n swore up n down he was not fucking around. ...",0

Strange encounter,"So this happened when I was a teenager (33 right now) and I never talked about it outside a few friends, I'm not sure what happened but I would like to know if anyone has seen or heard of something like this
One night was in my house, since the house was being remodel my dad, sis and I used to sleep in a big bedroom together, I awake to go to the bathroom but since remodelations the only one working was in the patio (our house was a colonial house with a yard inside the house, pretty common here in Colombia), once I got out of the bathroom I saw 2 huge yellowish eyes, looking at me from the ceiling, at first I thought it was some kind of cat or something like that, as I took one step forward toward the creature it stood up on it's hind legs and I could see a ""humanoid"" figure, long arms almost 2 meters (6 ft) tall and normal side head looking at me directly.
I should have been horrified and maybe screaming like if I had just seen a monster (I had 13 or 14 years by then) but instead I remember standing there looking at the creature and after a few time (not sure how) it began to walk backwards and disappeared into the neighborhood ceilings (I used to live in an urban area with one or two floor houses) and after it was gone I began walking to my bed as if nothing happened, I remember this really vividly, just walking without thinking, almost like I had to go to my bed, I get there and fell asleep almost immediately, it wasn't until next day I realized something weird happened.

I speak little or nothing about this for years until one night almost 5 years later when my father was going to sell  the house and it had to be painted and a few things fixed so a friend of mine and my GF at that time decided to ""stay"" in the house (it was more a construction site at the time) my GF and I went to sleep and he said he went to sleep on the couch but after a while he wanted something to drink, so he went to the ""kitchen"" (we took a mini fridge and a electric kitchen with us, but we only had electricity in the back of the house), so he went to the yard and he said he saw this tall, weird looking creature, same description as the one I saw years before but I never told anyone before that because I didn't want to sound crazy, he says after a while he began to walk to the couch and fell asleep instantly, same as what happened to me and when he told us about it next morning I was really freaking out.

I don't know what I saw, or what he saw... But if anyone can tell me if there is something similar I would appreciate it a lot because 17 so years later I'm still trying to figure out what happened in that house",0
"Help put my mind at ease.. Strange alien-related dreams, and apparently I've started sleepwalking out of nowhere?","Just to preface, I am married but my wife sleeps in the nursery with our baby (amazing 1y 2m old little girl) - partially because we have yet to break co-sleeping, and partially because I snore like a chainsaw revving up.  Normally, I have a dog with me and she has the other.  These dogs.. they're the greatest guard dogs in the world.  Or the worst.  I haven't decided.  They bark at ANYTHING out of the ordinary, from loud trucks to cats making noise in the other room.  They have been silent at night.

Wednesday of last week, I woke up around 3:30 laying across the bed.  My legs were where my left arm would be, hanging out of the covers, and my head was where my right arm should be.  When I woke up like this, it was incredibly disorienting, but I jumped up with energy and just stood in the dark for a bit trying to get my bearings.  My dog, who is a 75 lb. pit bull mix, had been curled up next to me, but he didn't really seem to think anything was out of the ordinary.  I had to pee, so I took care of that and went back to bed, no problem.  The next day at dinner, totally unprompted, my wife asked me what I was doing up in the middle of the night.  I hadn't told her what happened in the night.  She's a fairly light sleeper with the baby, but she said she heard me walking around the house in the middle of the night.  She said she knew it was me because she recognized my footsteps and the dog with her - a ~45 black lab mix - got up to sniff near the door and determined it was okay.  Alright, so maybe I'm sleepwalking now?  Strange, but whatever.

The next night passed uneventfully.  The third night (Friday), my dog wouldn't join me in the bedroom.  I'll admit, I'd gotten a little angry with him earlier in the night when he knocked over my daughter, so maybe he was skittish.  I woke up sleepwalking again.. maybe?  I felt like I was dreaming and doing some sort of weird Twister-like game.  I woke up with my weight on my knees on the bed like I was kneeling.  Once I came to again I sprang back up and stood in the dark for a second trying to get my bearings.  Checking my phone, it was 3-3:30ish again..  Went to pee, back to bed.  But this time I had a dream..  Let me preface this by saying that 1) at no point in this did aliens come to mind.  I thought maybe I was stressed out at work and it was manifesting in strange ways.. and 2) I don't personally believe I've been abducted by aliens.  But I'm curious about what the rest of you have to say.

So.. I dreamt that I was in a facility of some sort.  It was controlled by various types of aliens, which seemed to be the standard Greys or maybe a little different.. they seemed to have large heads that were pale human flesh colored, large eyes - about as big around as coffee cups, set far apart.  These are what I mainly saw roaming the facility.  I was kept in almost like an apartment that looked a bit like a private medical suite.  Reclining bed, machines all around, bathroom, but a TV on the wall.  Very gray and white and sterile.  I could leave, but I'd be closely watched.  The halls seemed to be filled with dozens of other rooms like mine.  Somehow I just knew where I belonged.  The aliens were everywhere.  There were other people roaming around.  Some didn't walk normally.  We were all in blue-gray outfits.. almost like scrubs or prisoner uniforms or something.  The ones who didn't walk normally seemed to be ""employees"".  The only way I could seem to go would lead to almost like a grocery or cafeteria area.  You could get food and take it somewhere to eat or go back to your room.  I remember seeing a particularly good looking slice of pepperoni pizza, and it was the only one left.  I got to it at the same time as an older lady and she let me have it..  I put something else on my plate but I forget what.  An alien watched impassively as I took it back to my room.  About the time I got back a couple ""employees"" came by with a cart to bring me my ""medicine"".  I didn't want to take it.  They insisted.  I woke up.

Every night since then (which, granted, has only been a couple) I've had some variation of that dream, or I've been back in that place.  One was fairly mundane, but last night I remember last night I had to mimic the strange walk of some employees because I was out of my room when I wasn't supposed to be. They haven't been as vivid as the first.. I don't recall being startled by the aliens in my dreams as I'm sure I would be in real life.  I just accept them as normal there.

So what's going on?  Am I just stressed out?  Is something really happening to me?  I don't feel like I'm gone long enough to experience any ""missing time"" except when I'm asleep anyway.. ",0
Possible abduction?? Or very vivid dream?,"This happened a few months ago. I fell asleep and had a “dream” that I was at home with my family in our old house. Our front door was opening and looking outside you can see our Jeep and that the doors were open. Upon looking outside I could see two astronaut suits sitting in our car. They waved. And I hesitantly waved back. I turned back to my living room and the two suits were now in my living room sitting in the car seats that they were just in. My whole family was seating on the couch. The two beings got up and took of their suits revealing that they were some sort of evolved big cats??? Came up to us and did usual cat stuff.  The entire time I was very uncomfortable and knew something wasn’t right. I whispered to my mom that we should kill them. I walked to the kitchen and as I was opening a drawer to get a knife I felt something behind me. I turned around and felt this insane painful vibration. Like something being drilled into the side of my leg. With my mom and brother standing above me. It was so painful that I woke up screaming. NOW I’ve heard that aliens may mess with your memory and make it seem that your abduction was just a bad dream. But I NEVER ever dream or remember them. Or even have very VIVID dreams. Idk I just thought I’d share.
Thanks for reading. ",0

UFO Research Group,"The Bureau for Paranormal-Supernatural Research & Investigation is looking for new investigators and support personnel. The organization is still in a very nascent stage, but I think it offers a lot of things that just aren't there anymore.

Before I go into detail about the organization, I'll give you a tiny bit of background about myself and why I think this is necessary. My name is Chris, and my interest in the unexplained started from a very young age when I spotted something strange in the night sky. I saw what I would later discover is a proto-typical triangular UFO that seemed to stop and vanish. 

This one experience was it for me, and I became interested in all things dealing with extraterrestrials and abductions. As an adult, following an enlistment in the Army, I started my own blog called 'Contact Blog'. At one point I was getting a large amount of traffic, including people that would email me reporting that they had been abducted.

I was at a loss for how I could help these people, so I largely referred them to MUFON and other organizations. A few months later though, I read more about Robert Bigelow, and learned that I had be unwittingly feeding direct sources of this phenomenon into a black-hole from which nothing returns.

It was then that I decided I would start my own investigative group. I have seen some others floated on here, but I feel these organizations fall short in some cases or have ulterior motives otherwise.

So, what sets the Bureau Apart?

1) Democracy. Our charter has a Central Committee that is elected by the membership. This committee decides if there will be dues, how those dues will be spent, etc. This committee also picks the Board of Directors who make up the leadership working-group and decide what cases are worth-while to pursue.

2) Community. Ours is a community organization. I imagine we will incorporate at some point as either a 501c3 or 501c7; and the democratic nature and sort of cooperative 'ownership' will be integral to this. In addition to this, we will have a very 'motivated' working culture. There will be a clear cut chain of command with clear directives given for a task (such as an investigation) and results expected. This as opposed to assigning a case number and say, selling some random investigatory gear.

3) Expertise. The Bureau is going to attempt to attract people with specific expertise in fields important for the investigation. But more than just seeking out expertise, we have processes in place which promote it. 

4) Integrity. We will attempt to eliminate conflicts of interest. Most importantly, this organization's goal is to investigate, not to profiteer off it's membership. Which is the reason why Democratic mechanisms were implemented.

5) Common Good. Robert Bigelow and his monopoly of information was one of the main reasons I started this organization. One of our stated goals is to use our findings for the public good and to be transparent with our investigations. We will offer final reports as well as dissenting or confirming opinions to the public at no cost.

So yeah.

I know this is not the first organization of it's kind. And there was a recent one created that I almost threw my lot in with. But after a bit of research, I concluded the best option was to continue developing this organization.

Looking for UK Abductees for University project/ blog post.,"Hey Guys, first time posting here so let me know If I'm doing anything majorly wrong. 

I'll get right into it, I'm a 3rd year Journalism student, and for my final project I have been tasked with making a magazine based of life experiences. 

Abductions have always been an interesting topic for me, I love hearing about people's experiences with the unknown, and would kinda like it to be the basis of my magazine. 

So, I'm currently looking for people in the UK, who would be willing to be interviewed (probably via skype, unless close) for the magazine. 

The magazine itself won't be published, but the article may be if the people are involved consent to it. 

Not sure if I should post my email along with this, encase anyone wants to contact me directly, I guess there's always DM. 

Thanks everyone. ",0
I think i was abducted...,"Two weeks ago, me and my girlfriend went on a weekend away in Salisbury (UK), stayed in a lodge out in the sticks. Had a good night, played some drinking games, watched a couple movies, made pizza etc. Then later on on the Saturday night she fell asleep midway through watching Kill Bill 2, im one of those people who struggles to sleep in a new bed so i stayed up on my laptop to finish the movie. Eventually i blacked out then awoke unable to move, i'd guess around 2 hours later, maybe 2am. I could hear a loud, high pitched whine, I guess the best way to describe it would be, in video games when a grenade goes off near by and your player goes deaf for a few seconds, that kind of noise. It was penetrating, like it was rattling my brain. I could hear nothing else. I could move my eyes, and managed to look around me, I could only make out two very tall, dark figures. I say dark, but the room was dark so I have no idea what colour their attire was. But they were menacingly tall, like 7ft tall. I was woken by my girlfriend the next morning at 11am, she had been up since 9 and left me to sleep. I felt dizzy for the rest of the day but nothing too extreme. I've not mentioned it to her or anyone else, but im a very skeptical person and all i can say is i have no rational explanation except perhaps sleep paralysis, which ive never had before. But from my research, it seems to account for most 'abductions'. I just wish I could remember more but my mind is totally blank after that brief glance at the figures. Has anyone experienced anything similar?

We stayed here FYI:

Metallic Room with Lights,"This is my first post to this subreddit! I'm trying to understand this phenomenon, as well as the entirety of the UFO/alien phenomenon, and I believe that my curiosity, coupled with past experiences, has been attracting attention. Kind of like the saying ""be the change you hope to see"" but in an environmental application.

Anyway, on to the story. So a week ago or so, I saw a black figure dart across the street where I take my morning and evening walks. It was during the early evening when this happened. That's another story and I've posted it on my page if anyone cares to read it.

Around the same time, I woke up after sleeping for a bit. I checked the clock on my phone and it said it was 12:24 AM. I used the restroom, scrolled through Facebook, and I assume I went back to bed. I have no recollection of going back to bed, but I must have been out like a light. 

I don't remember much, but I believe I may have had an OBE type of experience. I remember opening my ""dream"" eyes and being in a darkened room made of a pewter colored metal. The ceiling was coffered, and each section had a dull light. I felt no fear, only curiosity. I focused on the room, then noticed that the lights flickered when I did so. Intrigued, I began focusing more on these lights, and each time, they would surge and flicker more and more. Eventually they surged to a point where light flooded my entire field of vision, and I woke up in my bed. 

I had assumed I had been asleep for quite a while, so I expected it to be around 2 AM or so. I was shocked to see it was only 12:45 AM when I checked my phone. At the time, I shrugged it off, happy to have more time to sleep before my alarm rang.

In the morning, I walked my dogs and passed the streetlight in my yard, and a familiar feeling from the previous night left me pondering the reality of what had transpired. ",0
Government Staged Alien Invasion Possible? Evidence is Saying Yes!,0,0
"Trying to pull myself together, Need help to tell my story","First of all I will go right ahead and say it. I WAS ABDUCTED.  And I know exactly what saying that will bring. I am crazy, I am making things up, I am looking for attention, whatever. I really do not care what anyone will say but I need to get my story out. 


What I need is help to get my story out and also a way to protect myself as well in the process. I am looking for guidance in that. I want to record everything I know and talk about everything I can remember. I am also afraid to be recognized and silenced before I get all my proof and messages out to the world. 

My plan is pretty simple, I want to turn on a camera and start talking about everything, Also I want to show the proof that I have that will absolutely show that there is no way to deny what has happened. I have gone through some major changes during this that would be impossible to if not for a honest to God miracle, I'm talking biblical. Now I plan to start recording immediately, constantly, and consistently. I need help on saving everything in a way that if I was to disappear then everything would be automatically uploaded somewhere for everyone to see. I need to also know how to protect myself in the process, as in how do I keep my identity hidden until I get everything out there or forever. I know nothing is forever I want to stay anonymous as long as I can. And trust me when I say this, I already know I will not be around long enough to see the veil lifted. 


Into a little about it, trust me or not this a little to let you know what is up.

I was abducted. I was away from home when it happened and all by myself. When I came back there was some time difference between when I left to when I came back. A MUCH shorter time then what I was really gone though. It did not happen like anyone has described or anything I can find reported by anyone. I was not harmed, probed, or physically studied. The time away and where I was is the real story here though and I will get into that later when I know how to safely do so. When I got back I was physically different than when I left. Things that can be shown and measured. I also have before and after photos.  

Before I left I was a pretty average guy. I will not go into specifics of me but I played the game PUBG, I was big into politics, browsed r/the_donald and /pol a lot especially for what was going on at the time, I liked to go outdoors, and I had a GF that was not currently in the country that I reside. Now I am back. There was about a day in this time that I had lost. I also had to remember where I was and where I needed to be. First off my vehicle was inop due to the situation, I had no phone on me anymore, and I couldn't remember exactly where I was and how to get back. I mean I had a rough idea but not an exact path. I eventually made my way and got that all figured out. By the time I go home it felt completely different, like a dream I guess. Nothing felt as if it belonged to me and like I was just visiting a friends house or something. Eventually I turned on the computer to find some emails from my GF. My stomach felt sick, I completely forgot about her. She had been wondering where I was and was worried that I got lost or injured when I was out. I got to talk to her on my spare phone and It was like I had no idea who she was anymore. She joked that she thought I might of been cheating on her, I think I will tell her that I did. I can not see her or talk to her right now, and like I said, if we were to video chat she would see the difference immediately.  I was in college also, but since I have been back I have not even shown up, kind of forgot all about that and I don't see myself going back either. 

For someone that has so much to say, I am not sure what else to say. 

I need help, I need to tell it all and show the world what can happen and what has. I need to live through it until it is done. I don't know where to turn, I know this is not the best place for it but my time before was spent on reddit so I guess this is where I start. 

Thank you everyone.",0
Looking for Answers,"This is going to sound fucking crazy and definitely made up, but I need to get this out there. Not sure where else to post this. So this just happened two nights ago. My girlfriend and I are both 19 and live together. We're both attending the same community college in California before we transfer to a much bigger university in about a year. My girlfriend is a Microbiology major who's working on her nursing degree. She has a class/lab combination class that runs from 5:15pm to 10:40pm once a week. We only have one car and I had a lot of studying to do and was planning to use the school's free wifi to do it on my laptop. Here we have a really large 5 story science building, and each floor has a closed terrace with a few tables set up, and a large opening with a view of the sky. While I was working, I happened to look out and saw some very dim lights in the sky. They were moving in a lind of circular motion, but randomly and without any pattern. There was always at least 1 circling up there, with up to 4 more swirling around it. They would overlap sometimes, speed up, slow down. I didn't think anything of it at first, but soon it really started to bother me. I was staring at them, trying to figure out where they could be coming from and I couldn't figure it out. I even tried recording them and taking pictures but they were tpo dim to appear on my shitty phone's camera. ThenI got up and walked downstairs from the 3rd floor I was on and started to walk towards them and find the source. The time then was around 8:30.  They were directly above a large dirt field where they're developing a large building to house livestock in, and I walked to where I seemed to be directly under the lights and looked up at them. They got brighter for a brief moment, and then disappeared completely. As soon as they were gone I got this awful sensation in my arms and legs, like the kind you get when they fall asleep, but all at once and uncomfortable as fuck. My head also started pound like I got hit with a fucking bat, my ears were ringing and my vision got blurry. I turned around in a panic and fell on my face in the dirt since I didn't really have control of my legs. This all happened in a fraction of a second. I got up after I was able to function and stumbled back across the field to the building I walked from, I was going to go upstairs to get my girlfriend from her class. In that state it was all I could think to do, my head was throbbing so badly I could hear my fucking pulse and I couldn't function. I pulled on the door and it was locked. I looked around and realized all the lights in the buildings were off, the only light was from the streetlamps that lit the walkways. I pulled out my phone. The time was exactly 1:37 AM, over 5 fucking hours had passed somehow. I had about 50 missed calls from my girlfriend and just as many missed texts asking where I was and if i was okay. I just sank to the ground and held my head in my hands until my migraine died down enough to speak. I called her, she frantically asked what happened, where was I, was I okay, etc. I just told her I was at the college and needed to be picked up. I sat in the same spot while she drove over with the friend she had called when she couldn't find me, they'd been going around to my parent's, grandparents and friend's houses looking for me. She stayed on the line the entire time asking questions I couldn't answer. After they picked me up I tried to explain what happened. I know neither of them really believe me. She took me to her parent's house and we stayed the night there. Her mom was a nurse and has all sorts of medical degrees and wanted to be in the same house after hearing what I told my girlfriend. Everyone thinks I've had a mental breakdown and I don't know what to say. I called of work for the next few days and have just been lying in bed all day, I don't have the strength to really do anything or eat much. I feel so weak and drained, and I've been having really bad migraines and stomach aches that come and go and that pills won't help. I know from the way everyone whispers when they think i can't hear tjat they either think I'm lyimg or losing my fucking mind, and I guess I might be. I have suspicions about what happened but I don't want to jump to conclusions. If anyone has any kind of explanation or anywhere else I can post this where someone might I would really appreciate it.

They come in pairs.,"I believe I am at least the fourth generation of my family to be part of some kind of long-term alien project. Just what that project may be, or why they are interested in my family, is still a mystery to me.

The aliens I recall (I saw a pair of them them quite clearly at the foot of my head in 1993) are not the well-known 'Greys.' Mine have coppery-orange colored skin similar to that I've seen in some ants. Their eyes are enormous, pitch black, slanted at about a 30 degree angle relative to their midline, with well defined cheekbones, no discernible nose, and a small, lipless mouth that is very down on their faces. On the sides of their heads their is some kind of rough detail -- perhaps an organ that I cannot identify. I believe there are at least two morphological types: the shorter ones that I've just identified and another taller type with gigantic crania. This second type appears to be in charge. They are terrifying if they get into your head.

The shorter ones wear tight fitting dark 'uniforms' that remind me of scuba divers' suits. On their chests are affixed gold colored squares with a number of symbols in a grid pattern. I believe this is an instrument panel of some sort. The backs of their heads are covered with what again reminds me of scuba diving gear.

My great-grandmother used to tell stories of strange little men in dark suits standing at the foot of her bed way back in the late 1800s. They terrified her so much that she refused to sleep by herself. Unfortunately, I never knew her and have no more details of her experiences. My mother on the other hand was plagued by night terrors that she refused to discuss. She suffered from extreme depression and neurological disorders. She died at age 54.

I'll continue this later with some of my own experiences and recollections.

Possible Abduction??? (idk),"I was around 6 years old, way out in the country hills of Grand Saline Texas. I went to bed one night, this night was like any other, me scared of the dark and everything else in my room. My bed was positioned against the wall the door was on, and on the wall parallel to the bed(the wall in front of you when you walk in) also has a window. So it was about 8:00pm, and there I was lying in bed, looking out the window, at the night sky, and then suddenly it's as if someone hit the fast forward button on time. I watched the sun come up over the horizon in about 5 seconds. The moment time was back to normal, my step-dad(at the time), walked in and told me to get ready for school. I didn't feel nauseated or sick at all, time LITERALLY just flew before my EYES! . I remember going about the whole day telling all my friends and my teacher about the event, and their explanation was this: ""You probably just slept with your eyes open"". Not long after that, I had a night terror, so scary enough that I woke up screaming my head off and then bawling my eyes out of existence. This nightmare however, was unlike any other nightmare I've had since then. The images that I had seen are a bit vague now that I'm 17, but the emotions that I felt in that dream were so astronomically strong. The ones that I can recall are Anger, Sadness, but the one that I felt most of all was Fear. INTENSE Fear. Now I'm going to get a possible problem out of the way before I end this. There is another story out here somewhere on reddit, very similar to mine. Another guy when he was young had possibly the same experience as I with time just flashing by. He had sat down on his bed, and in mid-turn to lay down, it was suddenly morning.  That's the only reason that I'm posting this story in the first place. I had looked up ""Alien abduction stories"" on Google and I saw that guy's story, it reminded me of the wonky shit that I had witnessed.So there is my childhood story of some weird anomaly with time. Maybe.",0
Alien Abduction 5 Years Ago.,"Hey Everyone,

I just created an account here on reddit to tell you all this story. Maybe you'll find it interesting maybe you'll find it boring, me and my friend involved have never been able to explain it and most of the people we tell the story too just laugh it off. We aren't really offended by people not taking it seriously because nothing bad really ever came of it but maybe you all will have a little more insight.

So me and my best friend (still best friends to this day) were having a sleepover at his house. We live about a block away from each other so we would hangout almost every weekend. Anyways, we were having a sleepover at his house and we got to hang out in the living room that night. His house is packed by the way, he had a lot of family living in that house but at night everyone was asleep. So we're in his living room having a great time, We might of been watching a paranormal TV show (might of been fact or faked) because we we're really into that ind of stuff when we're 13 (still are lol) or whatever. Anyways im sitting on the big couch in an upright position and so is he, I believe we just got a huge plate of chips and we were really having a good time - we were wide awake, just got chips, and were laughing and watching the show. It had to be after Midnight which was early for us considering we would stay up till 5AM every weekend playing video games and whatnot. 

Here's where it gets weird...

The next thing we know, we are both waking up the next late morning/early afternoon with blankets on us, both in the fetal position on the couches we we're sitting on the previous night. We both wake up at the exact same time, it wasn't a jump up more like a gradual awakening at which point we both looked at each other. I don't really remember the in between details after that but I remember asking ""Dude, Do you remember going to sleep last night?"" to which I got ""No...I Don't..."" The weirdest thing is we were literally both just laughing and having a good time, how do you go from being wide awake to not remembering going to sleep? We would of had to get up, turn off the light, throw the chips away, and grab the blankets. And even if someone in his house came and did all that after we fell asleep, why the fuck don't at least one of us remember the process of going to bed? Occasionally one of us would start to fall asleep playing the game or whatever or watching a movie but we would always wake one another up and ask ""You ready to go to bed?"" even if the other was knocked the fucked out. 

I can't remember if we we're freaked out at that point when we woke up but we've recalled the story exactly the same ever since. I don't think anyone was home when we woke up as most of his family worked or slept in late or went wherever they go so we didn't ask anyone about it.

I've never had this type of missing time before or again. I've personally had a small experience with missing time and I think I will write that in another reddit post, linking this one. Tell me what you think. Thank You.

Missing Time - (Alien Or Something Explainable?),"Hello again reddit! So I just posted for my first time on this forum about an Alien experience me and my best friend had a few years ago (maybe it's alien, we are not sure) Anyways this is a followup, maybe the two are connected I don't know. You can check the story here 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Abductions/comments/6us6q6/alien_abduction_5_years_ago/

Anyways, let me ask you about this missing time situation that has happened several times in my life. Two at the least. It happened completely at random and i've never been able to explain it but when I was younger (Maybe 10+) This thing would happen, very rarely, where I would lay down to sleep, literally blink, then wake up fully rested. There was no gradually falling asleep and there was no gradually waking up. I would put my head down, blink, and it would be morning and my body would be in the exact same position as I was when I had put my head down the night before. This wasn't like being exhausted from walking all day or something and coming home and knocking out, that feels really good and although your out maybe in 10 or so minutes, you have that feeling of rest then  you have the feeling of waking up. 

I haven't been able to find anything online about this but I did talk to my dad about it and he said it has happened to him twice in his life. My dad said it happened when he was at his cousnins house and was confused when he woke up and again either at our old apartment when I was 2 years old or at our current house. We both think the experience is pretty cool rather than scary but the only missing time answer I could find was in the extra terrestrial. My mother said she doesn't remember this ever happening to her, but she does have dreams of being levitated and she says that what ever is doing it wants to get her out of the house, she's not scared of this either and only brought it up when I asked her. I only bring up my mother because of the possible alien relation.  

What do you guys think? Series of coincidences or is there a legit medical explanation for me and my dad blinking and waking up fully rested. Let me know if this has happened to you, or you know about it. Thank You.",0
Series of Strange Events: 2 Shared 2 Personal," I was around 4 when I saw my first UFO. My mother, sister, and I were driving home from swimming at a local lake. The sun had already gone down but it was still fairly light out. My mom pointed out to us that there was a strange object hovering in the sky moving around in no particular direction. It was your 'basic' UFO, rounded at the bottom, a wide center, but was slightly narrower at the top. My mom stopped the car and we got out for a better look. My mom took several pictures. My mother and sister reported no strange occurrences before or after we saw it. However, after this event took place I began having strange nightmares of the craft landing, seeing it open, and watching as white figures, around 4ft tall, walk out. The light from inside was bright and I could not make out ant significant details besides short, thin, and actually quite human shaped. These nightmares stopped about a year later, but only after another experience I will explain below. While gathering more details from my mom and sister I realized I didn't remember anything between seeing it and being in the car driving home; I specifically asked them if they remember getting back in the car and none of them do. My mom said she doesn't remember half of the ride home, but figured it had to do with spacing out while driving (a lot of people go in 'trances' while driving with out realizing it, it's actually fairly common and does have a scientific explanation) and my sister said it was probably just because of how long ago it was. 

Like mentioned above, I frequently had nightmares of seeing it land and seeing figures emerge, but they stopped after this occurance. It was probably no later than a year later when I woke up in my room. I remember being incredibly thirsty, like I hadn't drank in days. I got up and walked towards the kitchen. Before I reached it I saw flashing lights coming through the bay window in my living room. They kind of reminded me of police lights but we're moving around. A blinding bright light filled the whole room and I tried to scream but couldnt. I don't remember anything after that except waking up in my bed. After this all the nightmares about aliens stopped, but I remember being afraid of being abducted while I was asleep before I even knew what it was or possible. I always kept my door locked and triple checked my windows.
 
In between the this event and the next I had a weird experience which I cannot tie to aliens directly. I would wake up early in the morning, wait for my dad to leave for work, and then climb into bed with my mom, I tip toed into her room and climbed in bed to hear. As funny as it sounds hearing her snoring helped me fall asleep faster. As I tried to fall asleep I remember hearing the door open and I opened my eyes and shifted them to it. I saw a tall dark figure and at first I thought it was my dad coming back in, but as it moved closer I saw it had like a suit and coat on with a top hat. I tried to yell and wake my mom, but I couldn't move or talk. He walked towards me, leaned down, and looked at me. I couldn't see any features but I knew I was staring right into his eyes. I was terrified, I wanted to hide. He started to reach his hand out towards my face, but my mom started to wake up so he quickly left the room and disappeared down the hallway. My mom woke up and asked me to shut the door, but when she saw I was crying she turned on the light and just told me it was a bad dream. After, I used to be terrified of doors, when I was alone I would open every door in my house and turn on all the lights, periodically checking each room to make sure no one was inside, with time it eventually went away. 

Since then, I haven't had many weird experiences. The only one I can recall was about a year or two ago when my mom and I were sitting on the porch smoking a cigarette. She pointed out some glowing orbs in the sky and asked me if I knew what type of star/planets it were. I looked up and realized they were moving. We watched for at least 5 minutes as these orange orbs moved lazily across the sky moving side  to side slightly. Originally 3, they split into 7 before disappearing in the distance. 

I would love to hear any kind of feedback whether it's from a skeptic or a believer. I would love to hear other and similair experiences. If you have any information either comment or message me, if anyone is serious about having a discussion I was pm you my email. ",0
1 Personal and 1 Shared: My experiences,"The first happened when I was a very young kid. I was riding in the car with my mother and I think my cousin and sister, we were driving home from the lake. We drove past a field and my mom pointed out what looked like a ufo. She cannot remember whether she stopped or not, but, I remember her stopping. She has no recollection of the rest of what happened besides driving back home but soon after I had several nightmares of seeing it land, my mom stopping the car, us getting out of the car, and seeing figures coming out of it but then everything else goes blank- these nightmares only lasted about a year and I've only had a few scattered ones since then, but none recently. This happened when I was probably around 4-5 years old. The weirdest part is for the longest time I thought it was only a reoccurring childhood nightmare until like not even 3-4 years ago my mom mentioned, when I brought up aliens, that we saw one when I was a kid while coming home from the lake and my mind exploded because suddenly I realized it was all real. I talked about it with my mom for a while. It was really scary. However, my sister and cousin have never said anything, my mom doesn't remember anything after seeing it and going home.

The second happened also around this time maybe a year or two afterwards and I cannot say whether this happened for real or not, it happened when I was kid and could have been a dream (even though it was completely different from the others I had), as I said above I frequently had mini nightmares of the first encounter. I remember waking up in my bed and being incredibly thirsty so I got out of bed and walked down the hall towards my kitchen. I remember seeing lights flashing in the corner of my eye so I turned my head to look through the windows in my living room and saw blurry, multi colored lights. They reminded my of looking through a frosty window at Christmas lights, and kind of like police lights flashing. Everything turned completely white and I tried to scream, but couldn't and the next thing I know I woke up and look towards the table in my room and I do see a cup of water that wasn't originally there. The only reason why I bring up this story is because it's not my only experience. Had it been an isolated incident I probably wouldn't think anything of it. I am skeptical because it seemed like a dream, I cannot recall having any other dreams or memories of anything else pertaining to this incident and also there were other people in the house with me and we lived in a neighborhood with houses very close to each other. 
However, in the past year I have done research and came across TWO reports from the town I live in (One from 2am the other from atound 6-7) saying in 2003 a women witnessed a UFO in the early morning hours not far from my house, they both said she could see it above the treeline, and maybe I'm just grasping at straws but it's seems too likely to be a coincidence.

Visitation from extraterrestrial.,"First off I need to say if you've ever experimented with mushrooms, you'd know that in small doses or your first hour or so before peaking, the effects are not all that strong and you're not really seeing things that aren't actually there. This event was experienced by me and another person, both under a mild influence of psilocybe cyanecen mushrooms. I know this is breaking rule 10 but I don't know where else to post this. Please hear me out before discrediting my story.

I've stopped telling this story to people because once they hear the fact that hallucinogenic mushrooms were involved they automatically discredit any further observations that, mind you, were BOTH witnessed between me and my girlfriend that night. So i'm taking time to tell it hear in hopes of finding anyone who may have had a similar experience or give me some kind of information between the relationship between psychedelic mushrooms and contact with extraterrestrial life.

It was a cold winter night, the sky was completely clear here in Washington, clear enough to see distant faint stars, and the grass was frosty. The green grass stood stiffly frosted, but no snow covered the ground. My girlfriend, I and friend had just bought some cyanecen mushrooms, native to the pacific northwest, and decided to take them in my families, small cabin here on the outskirts of town. Before we had even gotten back, my friend R had gotten impatient and took his mushrooms before any of us. By the time we were upstairs, he was already laughing and enjoying his trip. Me and my girlfriend S took ours and we waiting for the effects to kick in. The mushrooms seemed to taking effect, nothing that intense. Me and S decided to go out onto the front porch to smoke cigarettes and talk. We walked outside, mostly just feeling the euphoric body high from the shrooms, smoking cigarettes and having semi-deep discussions about life. I was standing up, facing S who was sitting on the porch steps facing me. She was speaking to me when suddenly, and quite abruptly, she stops mid sentence and looks out towards the valley in utter shock. I remember this moment very clearly and even given our state of mind, her reaction didn't seem to be fitting. I look at her for about 1-3 seconds and turn to my rear-left to match her gaze. The second I looked out from the porch and onto the lawn... *crunch*, *crunch*....... *cccrunch*. The elongated-foot-sounding steps did not sound like any animal hoof or short-toed deer. It sounded human. And based on the sound of the steps, whatever was there had stopped right at the shadow line created by the porchlight, and casted by a large stump that stood right outside the deck. I knew at that instant that me and S both heard what was there, and without speaking a word to each other, we paused for 3 seconds and immediately ran inside the front sliding door. We were both in a fearful panic.

After we had ran back upstairs and told my friend what had happened, I asked her what she saw when she had stopped speaking seconds before we heard the footsteps. She explained that the entire sky had lit up white like a bolt of lightning, but there wasn't a cloud in sight and it didn't even make a sound. The timing of these two anomalies happening within seconds of each other draws no other conclusion, other than them being immediately connected. And the fact that we both heard the crystal-clear sounds of something only taking three steps, then stopping right before us means it could not have been walking across the lawn the whole time. Whatever it was started just a few feet away, seemingly from thin air. I wonder if whatever this being was, if it was interested in our choice to take psychedelics and maybe we were giving off some sort of frequency that attracted it there for observation. To completely discredit any relationship be tween psychedelics and contact seems arrogant to me.

I hope someone believes me and can offer any information or explanation relating to this incident, This happened about 7 years ago in my senior year in high school.",0
Dream?!,"A few nights ago I had a ""dream"" where myself and a group of people were camping out in the woods. We were all hangin out around a fire pit just havin a good time when we started seeing these extremely bright lights pass over head. 

I remember being terrified. Me and a couple others went and hid in a vehicle, and I could see a light appear in front of us, it created a hill and turned a spotlight on us. 

The sheer terror I could feel was so real. I ducked my head down below the dashboard, but it was too late.

A being that looked like a cross between a power ranger and Optimus prime appeared in the drivers seat next to me and he was holding a ""vaccination gun"".

I remember asking ""what is this for?""

And he replied ""it's for your DNA""

To which I replied ""is it good for my DNA or bad for it?""

And he said ""we shall see"" and promptly ""shot"" my left shoulder with the vaccine.

I had a false awakening in this dream where I woke up and was recapping the events from the night before and I realized that my left shoulder, where I was injected, was extremely painful.

Then I woke up for real and noticed that my left boulder gelt like I had received a painful tetanus shot.

Two days later, my 8 year old son told me that he was abducted. ",0

I'm afraid my family may be being targeted for abductions,"So, here's the situation. I live in southeastern Oklahoma and some strange things have been occurring. What prompted me to make this post was the most recent events, both of which happened on the street I live on. 

The night before last my brother and I were driving home after running to Walmart at about 1 AM (he works nights so this is really the only time I ever see him). While I was driving up the street to our house, we live about in the middle of the street, we saw something that we at first thought was a shooting star fly above our car. I didn't think anything of it until tonight, when I saw something similar. The one from the night before last was incredibly bright and close to my car, and lit up the entire interior of my car, didn't have a tail like a shooting star should, and moved steadily over my car until it disappeared seconds after. The incident tonight involved an orb that flew over my car, but didn't shoot by. It just steadily moved over my car, but didn't disappear, just kept moving to the horizon until I couldn't see it anymore. I ran inside and made sure everyone was inside and in bed. Once again this orb didn't have a tail and didn't behave like a shooting star. Both were far to low to be a plane, and there was no bad weather to obscure my view. 

We also have a new dog, that loses her mind at about 2 AM even night. Luckily I know her past owner and asked if she'd always done that. They told me that they'd never even heard her growl. I don't know what's going on but I'd like other people's opinions and input. Also if you know of anyways that I could protect my house and my family I would appreciate it. 

P.S. There is also many strange occurrences from my childhood that you may be interested in, if so just let me know. 
ALSO: I have always had violent nightmares and night terrors, ones where I have actually injured myself. I don't know if terrors hat could factor into what's going on here but I know that I need answers. Thank you in advance, Katie",0

I was roughly 10 years old, I had fallen asleeep for the night.  I woke up in the middle of the night and felt like something was off.  I had a glowing half spherical moon attached to my ceiling.  However, when I looked at it, it was no longer the shape of a moon, but a glowing green blob. 

 After seeing this, and feeling like something was not right I looked outside.  I still remember this part like it was yesterday.  Upon looking out my backyard I instantly noticed that there were 2 moons in the night's sky!  They looked like our normal moon but there were definitely 2!

After exploring more and not finding anything else off, I went back to sleep.  Since then I've concluded that I somehow got abducted, and put into an environment that closely resembled my actual room at the house.

Please let me know if you've had a similar experience!",0
Looking for abductee to interview about their experience for a paper.,I am writing a paper on alien abduction and I need an abductee to interview. I have been interested in abduction for years and I would love to hear a firsthand account! ,0
I have juust realized i may have been abducted as a child. Can anyone help me figure this out?,"Theres a memory i have from very early childhood. I couldnt have been older than 5 or 6. Im floating toward the ceiling. Theres a someone or something with me. I know i wasnt asleep. I recall almost every detail but what the being looked like. I wasnt afraid, i was calm. Thats all i remember. Following that my whole life Ive felt a little different. Ive always felt a strong sense of purpose, even if i dont know what that purpose is. Ive considered an out of body experience but i have a gut feeling thats just not it.  Ive had sleep paralysis before and i know thats not it either. Ive asked my mom about my memory and she said had the same experience more than once in her life. Whats drawn me the possibility of abduction is that out of boredom Ive been watching ufo related tv shows while i work. At first it was just entertainment until i learned about abductions. The more i learn, the more possible it seems. Can anyone help me rule out  normal phenomena before i potentially waste time and money on hypnotherapy?",0
Just wondering if anyone else has seen a link in alien abduction cases and cases of ghost/demon haunting.,"These are the similarities I have noticed:
    
Glowing orbs seen in persons house.
  
Both reports of the phenomena following a specific person or family even after moving homes. 

One [witness](https://youtu.be/BG0OY_SYGlg?t=2355) claims seeing a face with no eyebrows and all black eyes.  On the show's reenactment it showed a bald white face with black eyes. 

A [women](https://youtu.be/dgwTAXJA2uA?t=1747) was being haunted by glowing orbs and lights. After she yelled at it to show itself, a shoulder, neck, and bald head appeared. Everyone in the room apparently saw it and the lights were caught on camera.

Most Believable Alien Abduction Story,Which one is it??,0
"Does anyone have a counterargument to the ""Aliens are Demons Theory""?","[ I'm probably going to post this in both the Abduction Reddit and the Alien Reddit. ]


-




It feels like it's impossible nowadays to make a video on YouTube about Aliens without getting a comment saying ""Aliens are Demons, bro!"" 




-



And while the ""Alien = Demon"" theory as been getting more and more popular over the years, I see little to know counter arguments to this theory. 



-


I wish someone would try and defend the alimentary of aliens as actual aliens. 


-



With the constant arguing between what is true or false in the Ufology community, it's astonishing that no one ever talks about the Demon theory except for those preaching it. 


-


To my understanding, the narrative that several Christians are pushing is that ""Demons are pretending to be Aliens in order to trick people into believing in Aliens, so as to lose faith in the Bible? Also, Illuminate""




-



If I accept that Aliens are demons, I guess I also have to accept all the other nonsensical things that the Bible says, such as the Earth existing with plants and vegetation 3 days before the Sun and every other star in the universe were created, let alone the entire universe being made in 7 days, and that an entire species population can be formed through just two of members of said animal / human species, that the earth is only 6 to 7 thousand years old, that mating lambs in front of branches help determine the spots on their fur, and that 90% of everyone that has ever lived is currently burning in fire for all eternity?

Anyways, I was hoping someone has a counterargument to the ""Alien = Demon theory."" I would be very interesting in reading some.  ",0
A beam of light came down from my ceiling.,"I was watching t his video, and it reminded me of something that happened to me years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCR7cwip37U
I was in this light, and so was my sister. This was sometime around 1997 or 1998, I lived in the 3rd floor of a 4 floor apartment building. Me my sister and my cousin were playing Mario Kart 64. A beam of light (very similar to the ones in this video) beamed down from the ceiling onto my sister for a few seconds. This light was so white, I couldn't see my sister in it. Only whatever limbs that were sticking out of the light. Inside of the light she looked like a shadow almost. The light then moved on to me. I remember I couldn't see myself in the light, and could barely see Mario's cap in the game. I remember I was pressing the L & R buttons to make him bounce to spot him. The light then went around my cousin and stood by the doorway. I have to say I have never seen any light as beautiful as this one. It was the purist white I have ever seen to this day. The edges of the light was blue. I came from a religious family. We all thought god had come and we were left behind. We all got on our knees and prayed.
So, I was in the light, and as far as I know, nothing happened to me. Also, considering how bright that light was, it didn't hurt my eyes.

"when a stone cold rational atheist, computer scientist posts to /r/abductions.","Ok, I like to think I'm a rational intellectual, someone who would never be writing something like this. Well, here it goes.

Two weeks ago I woke up with this feeling of drowsy brain fog, and two strange dots on my arm and neck. I didn't think much of it (just assumed it was acne). The night before is a hazy memory to me now, but I live in a studio apartment and have had this uneasy feeling I wasn't alone in the apartment the last couple nights. A few nights ago, I got home late from work, and I swear as I was putting my key in the door I could've sworn I heard tiny footsteps running away from the door. My apartment isn't big, its not like there was anywhere to hide if something was in there.

Anyhow, the next two weeks I had these really strange nosebleeds at work (I'm a software engineer). They would come on suddenly and it was a lot of blood, then stop. I got nervous so I went and saw a doctor but they said it was just allergies and dry air. This sort of thing never happens to me.

Abduction didn't cross my mind until Friday, when I had this vivid, terrifying dream of being abducted. It was a preying mantis-type grey alien, and the surroundings were different- I was a child (like 6) in my parents' old house. First it captured me, then I broke free and went to protect my brother. It moved crazy fast... like a Bugs Bunny cartoon almost, it tried to take my brother, but (we played baseball at the time), I grabbed a bat and started swinging but froze. You know when Professor X freezes people with his mind? It was like that. Then I woke up in a cold sweat. I realized when I had the odd sensation waking up a few weeks before, a drafting ruler (about the size of a bat, I used it for artwork years ago) was near my bed.

Other things were very weird the last two weeks. I've felt this insane amount of empathy... I was always sternly focused on work, but I just bought a roll of $1 coins and I'm wrapping them in these fly fishing dove feathers I have to give the homeless folks I see walking to work everyday. I just want them to have some hope. It's an excruciating empathy, like I can feel their pain, I want to cry when I walk past them. 

Folks, a few weeks ago I was basically living a husk of Don Draper's life- dark, cold, professional. I started creating artwork again, something I havent done in years (I have a near photographic memory and can draw masterworks from memory, but I've let that go by the wayside for the last year as I focused on work). 

This last part is the craziest one. I can't tell, but I swear to god I heard my coworker's thoughts. He was talking, and as we were walking to lunch, I heard, clearly in my head ""this guy doesn't listen to me."" In his voice. His lips weren't moving (it's true, too... I thought the guy was kind of dumb, as of two weeks ago). When we sat down for lunch, and started eating, I started to really try to listen, and later on mentioned that I was listening to him. He gave me the oddest look.

I don't know what the hell is going on, but I don't really want to regress or anything. Why wake a nightmare. I feel pain in strange places when I try to think about it (a metallic feeling in my belly button, tinnitus in my head, a throbbing sensation in the base of my skull). I don't know what these creatures would want with me. It's not wish fulfillment or wanting to be special- I don't want that- but I was an oddly sharp kid growing up, learned how to read when I was ridiculously young (18 months). I went on to study AI and now build AI simulacra in the CS field. But my drug-addicted distant cousin also claims ""aliens"", so I can't yield any causality to my circumstances. 

Whatever they did, if it really was a ""they,"" I think it was ultimately for the better (after the nosebleeds and mental fog subsided). My work anxiety is gone. I'm creating artwork, helping others. I genuinely feel more connected. Maybe they are simply here to help us.",0
Interview with an Abductee: Christian S. Podcast,"[Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/paranormalthoughtspodcast/interview-with-an-abductee-christian-s) 
Christian S. is an experiencer from Alabama America. Christian is one of the most sceptical experiencers I have spoken with. This means Christian has not jumped to any conclusions and has thought at great lengths about his experiences trying to make sense of them. The topic of alien abduction is extremely difficult for people to come out and speak about. This was one of the only times Christian has spoken to anyone about this topic, let alone a stranger conducting an interview.",0

Correlation between depression/anxiety and abductions,"A therapist I used to see who was very open to the idea of alien abductions lead me to realize that many people who claim to have been abducted or have had paranormal experiences also have depression, anxiety or both.

I have suffered from anxiety and depression for 10 years now and never thought about them being related to my paranormal experiences until I started reading other peoples stories. For the past 10 years I had thought that these experiences were most likely the result of my mental illness, but what if my mental illness was a result of these experiences? 

There is a Ted Talk called ""Psychosis or Spiritual Awakening"" by Phil Borges who suggests that maybe, if trained properly, people with psychosis can actually see/sense more than the average human. That maybe they are more spiritually awake than others.

There are also many theories and studies that show people with depression scoring higher on realism tests. Meaning that they are less ignorant about that world than people who don't have depression, ""ignorance is bliss"". 

I am in no way saying that people who need medication should go off of it, that is a very dangerous idea. I just cant help but wonder if there are aliens/spirits are some people more sensitive and aware of them than others? 

Are we depressed because deep down we know more than we should? Or are our minds making up stories because we are depressed with our reality?  ",0

"""Glow worm"" type things at night, has anyone else had a similar experience?","I think I've only told two close friends about this and gotten the ""you're crazy"" look. When I was about 5 years old my family had a house surrounded by woods, I had recurring nightmares and insisted on either sleeping with the lights on all night or in my mother's bed. The nights I slept beside my mom in her room I would wake up to see the room crawling silently with what is best described as glow worms. They were more like caterpillars that glowed brightly, the room would be filled with maybe 15-25 of them at a time. 

The thing is I never felt scared or even thought it odd until the next day when I would wake up. One of the days I was thinking about trying to touch one to maybe try and figure out what they were, I even went to sleep in my mom's room with a pipe cleaner to poke one with. I remember seeing them multiple times after having the pipe cleaner but for some reason every time I saw them I would forget to try to get close to them. 

I think this happened for about a year before stopping, I never told my parents and tried to rule out possibilities as an adult. They were not fireflies, there's no way they could have gotten in to the house and what I saw were definitely more like caterpillars, they couldn't seem to be able to fly. 

I've been interesting in paranormal/abduction stories for a long time have never come across anything similar to what I saw. Let me know your thoughts!",0

Possible Abduction During REM Sleep? Personal Account,"So I was recently telling a good friend about a VERY vivid dream I had and was wondering if it could possibly be an abduction, and if not from an extraterrestrial perhaps being from another dimension.

A bit of history, I'm 25, have a history of vivid dreams since childhood and used to, when I was younger (but the ability slowly waned) was very intuitive and had a better ability to sense things of a paranormal nature.

So basically in the ""dream"", I was in some sort of craft or room, where all the walls and windows were completely transparent and I saw a vast expanse of space, with mostly teal, blue, black and white stars, galaxies and other ""space stuff"" I'm not an expert on astronomy. 

The ""beings"" looked like us but wore doctor/nurse like uniforms and I was on something like a dentist's chair, where they went into my nasal cavity and pulled out a live locust. 

I would have written this off as just another dream, but what was so strange was that I could FEEL pain and irritation as well as the sensation on the insect being extracted. It was unlike any other physical sensation I've had in a dream, because I have NEVER felt anything being pulled OUT of my body. 

So yeah, I'd really appreciate any input, resources, links, etc.

Missing 5 1/2 hours.,"Was sharing the story with someone earlier and thought I'd share it here. 
Not a terrible lot to tell but I'll let the facts speak.

Background: 
Me and best friend traveled to/from Baton Rouge once a week, if not more, for 2+ years. Drive took 2 1/2 hours normally but if doing the speed limit maximum of 3 hours.
http://imgur.com/a/feCO6

When I was 17 (13 years ago) me and a buddy were in Baton Rouge visiting his father. They got into a fight (punches thrown) and we called his grandmother, who he lived with, saying we were on our way home (as we were pulling out of the drive way of his dads). 

It was 10:30, so we told her we would be home at roughly 1:30am. I was to make sure he did the speed limit since his adrenaline was pumping and he might be hurt. She said that's fine, she would wait up for us so she could look at his hand (that he broke the pinky on, she was a nurse) and fix it up.

A little over the halfway point, we turned off the Interstate to the main road to get back to our town. 
This stretch of road has very few turn offs and is about 20 miles long (Maybe 5-6 turn offs, it's just a long back road that people use to get to the interstate).

I really needed to use the restroom so we pulled off on the shoulder of the road and I got out to urinate.
While urinating there was a car that came over the hill. 

Looking back, this is where we believe the abduction happened. We don't remember the car ever passing us (and people who have did this kind of thing know when you are urinating on the shoulder of the road, you are very aware of cars coming/going).

We think nothing of it, as it doesn't register with us and continue driving. 

When we get to his grandmothers she comes out and ask what happened she was worried about us, why didn't we answer her phone calls or call her.

This is where we start thinking something is off and realize that it's daylight and is after 7 in the morning.


So the **tl;dr**:

A 3 hour drive took us 8 1/2 hours. 

We don't remember a car passing us when we should have.

5 1/2 hours of our lives are missing.

We would of thought nothing of it had his grandmother not pointed out the time we left and what time it was when we got there.

Buddha GrandMaster Talks About Aliens,"Hi All,

I have some lecture excerpts that you might be interested in. It's from a Buddha Master from the Falun Dafa school of QiGong. A very high level cultivation technique that is very righteous and powerful:

http://www.falundafa.org

I recommend checking this out, especially the book 'Zhuan Falun':

https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/pdf/ZFL2014.pdf

Wow what a read, it covers so many things, from the mysteries of the microcosm to the macrocosm, other dimensions, the soul, ancient prehistory, supernatural latent abilities, chi, gong energy and so many other things.

This practice is also being severely persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party with practitioners being sent to concentration camps, tortured, there organs sold on the black market and often killed:

http://en.minghui.org/cc/1/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvAOOwvJMZs

In these following lecture excerpts, the founder of Falun Dafa, Mr Li Hongzhi spells out the Alien Agenda that is upon this earth and it's implications to humanity as a whole.
The rest of the lectures that have been given around the world can be found here:

http://www.falundafa.org/eng/books.html

Also Mr Li Hongzhi has been interviewed by Time Asia, another fascinating read:

But in closing, here are the lecture excerpts on the Alien Agenda that is taking place on our planet, I hope you will find them of interest.

Quote:

“Let me first explain what alien beings are all about. You know that this Earth isn’t the only planet with life in this universe, and Earth hasn’t existed just this once. I’m saying that at Earth’s position there were Earths that existed before. Those previous Earths were discarded. Some exploded. It happened many times—the number has been quite large. The final stage of an Earth has always been a time when its lives were the most corrupt and its matter was the most impure, so the Earth could no longer be kept. It would be eliminated since the whole sphere had turned into a ball of karma.

The reason is, lives reincarnate . They reincarnate into soil, rocks, plants or matter, and regardless of what they are reborn as, they carry karma with them . Earth would become a ball of karma when karma was all over the place, so at that point it would be eliminated. There would still be some people on Earth who were relatively good, and those exceptionally few or extremely few ones were taken and placed onto another planet within the Three Realms.

Yet through the ages this Earth has been replaced innumerable times and each time there were people who remained. So over time those remaining lives increased in number. The gods in each time period created humans with a different appearance, so the differences are quite substantial, and there are some who were created on other planets. These are alien beings. They’ve become like a record of history , placed there like a page of history left behind . That’s the function they serve, a minor one. They were left behind from the final stage of Earth during those times, and took with them the technology they had in those times over to other planets, so their starting point was more advanced.

Over this long period of time, the knowledge of the universe they came to grasp far exceeds that of the inhabitants of today’s Earth. Their bodies can enter other dimensions and adjust to the mode of those dimensions they are in; they’ve developed to this stage. Those things they ride in that fly back and forth—those aircraft that human beings call flying saucers—can enter other dimensions and fly into other space-times. If they travel in a fast space-time, after being there for just a short while they traverse a long distance. So that speed is inconceivable to human beings. The types of fuel they use aren’t in the least the kinds of substances conceivable by the technology, theories, or concepts of modern science.

Over the ages, these alien beings have continually been developing and metamorphosing. So in this universe there have really appeared the abnormal social relations that these kinds of lives have. Greed and lust have caused something like star wars to actually happen over where they live. They haven’t yet threatened humankind because humankind doesn’t have the ability to pose a threat to them . So they haven’t attacked humankind.

They would attack humankind if you were to threaten them. Although alien beings haven’t attacked humankind, they know that a human body is the most perfect. They’ve thus taken a fancy to the human body and want to steal it. They saturate all domains of humankind with science to make human beings firmly believe in science and rely on it. When human beings ’ thoughts and way of existence are completely assimilated to theirs, they just have to replace people’s souls and humans will become them, and they will eventually replace the human race.

It’s a long story. They have been coming here full-scale since the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution in the West. They had come prior to that time, but they didn’t control people then. Their full-scale arrival began when Caucasian society entered the industrial age. They made full preparations and systematic arrangements for occupying this earth. It was they who created science for human beings .

So this science was set up by aliens. Their purpose was to unify human beings and simplify their thoughts to the point of being as uniform as machines. And they unified knowledge to make it easy for them to later on control and replace human beings. Furthermore, they’ve chosen a few nationalities as the vanguards of their future, total control of humankind. Japan is the vanguard that drives technology.

The United States is the vanguard in breaking away from all ancient cultures on earth. The cultures of even the most ancient and closed-off nations haven’t been able to escape. The whole world is being impacted by America’s modern culture. England was the vanguard in the manufacture of machinery during the early stages , and Spain was the vanguard for mixing the human races.

The way alien beings get human beings to shake free of the gods is to mix the races, causing human beings to become rootless people, just like the plant hybrids people make nowadays. South Americans, Central Americans, Mexicans and some people in South East Asia— all of these races have been mixed. None of this can evade the gods’ eyes. Alien beings have made rather extensive preparations for overtaking human beings.

Everyone who knows how to operate a computer has been registered. Of course, our students don’t have this problem. Once you obtain the Fa, I clean up that layer of your body that’s been occupied by them. They have formed a layer of their body within the human body.

It’s incredibly frightening! Everything people learn from elementary school right up through college is the science they brought , and everything that human beings use nowadays is the product of this omnipresent science. Why do the inspirations people get make computers and technology develop with such tremendous speed? It’s done by that layer of the body that alien beings formed so as to control the human race. It’s exactly because that system of their technology and science that has formed in the human body is making people’s minds do so.

Today it’s incredible how developed computers are. But it is not a human technology. Man will be replaced by alien beings if it continues like this for long. But think about it, everyone: Alien beings are, after all, beings within the Three Realms, where ordinary humans are. There are other reasons why they dare to do this sort of thing. It has happened because the Fa of the universe has deviated and gods no longer look after things.

So it has to do with high-level beings as well. If this situation is to be turned around, it has to begin from high levels. That’s because they have this idea that human beings are no longer any good, their morality has degenerated, and everything is perverted. So they think it’s all right to just replace them , given that they are going to be eliminated all the same. They have to pay for all of the bad things they’ve done, for sure. The principles of this universe are absolutely reasonable toward any life.

So they have to answer for everything they’ve done. As for how their lives will eventually be dealt with, alien beings definitely won’t exist in the future. If there are truly good ones among the alien beings, then their lives can reincarnate as other lives. Bad lives will be eliminated. So every thing that every being does positions himself for the future . And that includes all human beings. Whatever a human being does positions him.

That’s the situation as far as alien beings go. They are being swept out up there, and they found out about the cleaning, so they scurried over here, and in particularly large numbers in recent years. As of right now, most of the alien beings who have come here did so fleeing for their lives. They knew that in the end it would be hard for them to escape, so some alien beings have married Earth dwellers. But it’s not that they marry legitimately, because no one would marry them. They catch a village woman to leave behind their offspring. And there are those who are hiding among ordinary people. They can’t stay under cover no matter how they hide. Immense gong is coming up from the microscopic level.

Whether it be steel, iron, wood, the human body, water, rocks, air, plants, animals, substances, etc., from the microscopic level of everything gong is coming up toward the surface. Tell me, where could they escape to? The gong is omnipresent and rushing up to the surface . So they’ve seen that there is no way to dodge it or to hide from it. How do they exist? They aren’t actually possessing spirits. But some of them have assumed man’s appearance and walk the streets . You have no idea who they are.

Some have hidden and don’t come out. But the number is now small, very small. In the past they could hide , and their flying saucers could fly up and go to another dimension. But the other dimensions have all been cleaned up. Immense gong is rushing here and they can no longer hide. They can only hide in a cave or at the bottom of the sea in this dimension. Even so, they can’t stay concealed. Anyway, that’s the problem they face . All lives are positioning themselves in this affair. You should know that although alien beings brought their science to human beings to achieve their goals, gods are in charge of everything and are in turn using them.”

Quote:

“Having seen many movies, having read many imaginative stories, and having been influenced by a lot of things in society, people have developed a warped mindset that indulges in fantasy. You asked how to communicate with intelligent beings. Let me tell you all that an ordinary person can’t do that sort of thing, and he lacks the ability. If you could indeed communicate with intelligent beings but weren’t a cultivator yourself and were without energy, you would be in danger. You might lose your life any moment. Besides, you would see gruesome spirits but no high-level beings, for your level would be too low and limited to only that of humans. So it would be a terrifying situation. It’s even more terrifying if you want to communicate with living beings beyond Earth.

Lives beyond Earth are just lives on other planets within this physical dimension that our human eyes can perceive. Yet those lives don’t regard people as human beings. They think people are beasts, a kind of animal. They slaughter people at will and experiment on you at will. They kidnap people to their planets, lock them in cages, and put them on display as animals. Many of Earth’s people who have gone missing were taken by them. I can also tell you that today’s human science was created by them. Why have those aliens created for humans something like the current science? It’s because what they have on their planet is akin to it.

They want to bring it to this planet and eventually replace humans. They found that the human body is really perfect, flawless. So they covet the human body and want to eventually replace humans. They have added their things into one layer of human beings’ molecular cells. That’s already been done now and it has formed on a large scale. So for me to save you today, I not only have to remove all the attachments and karma that you need to eliminate, but I also have to clean up this stuff for you. The road humankind is traveling down is dreadful. Computers would have commanded people one day. Ongoing developments have conformed to this trajectory. Humans were to become the slaves of computers and machinery, and eventually be replaced by aliens.

Why have computers developed so quickly, and why has the human brain suddenly become so “sharp”? All of this has been carried out by aliens controlling the human mind. Aliens have registered everyone who knows how to operate a computer.For real. As to our students, I’ve cleaned all of that up for them, so that they won’t be interfered with by aliens when they use computers. Why are there aliens? Some aliens originate from their planets. Why do some aliens always come to Earth? It’s because they were once humans on Earth. But it wasn’t the Earth of our time. It was the previous Earth that existed at the same location as this Earth. Earth has been replaced many times.

Each time it was replaced, there was a portion of lives—living beings created by gods with different appearances, some of whom were similar to today’s humans, some of whom had different forms who were relatively good at the time and were thus preserved. They weren’t destroyed, yet they weren’t allowed to enter the period of human development on the next Earth, either. So they were sent to another planet. That’s how it was done every time. Also, it has left a record of this universe, for they were humans on Earth in different time periods. It serves that purpose. 

But due to a slackening in overseeing them, they have developed, and they have created all kinds of scientific methods according to their schemes; some are like the kind on our earth, some assume other forms, and there are a variety of modes of development. Of course, they don’t use the term “science.”

The names they use belong to their languages and concepts. These things have deteriorated further and further. And with the deviation of the cosmos’ Great Fa, the aliens have become worse and worse too. That’s why all aliens are in the process of being completely eliminated. They are being eliminated throughout the entire universe. At present, those up there have been eliminated.  What’s left are only those who have escaped to Earth, who are mingling among people or who have attached to human bodies. And there are other types too.”

Quote:

“As you know, modern science was brought to mankind by aliens. They came when the Industrial Revolution began in the West. They started with mathematics and chemistry—started from the shallow, simple knowledge of the earliest days—and penetrated on through to modern machinery, and eventually they developed up to today’s computers. As development continues further their ultimate goal will be to replace human beings.

How is the replacement to take place? As I mentioned, in the body of today’s human beings almost everyone has a layer of the body that was created by aliens.Why do I say that? It’s because all of the science that they instilled in you has created a warped human mindset in your mind. There have never been humans like this in any of mankind’s previous civilizations. When the mind is like that, so is the body.

As you know, every cell in your body is you, and your brain is connected to the brain in every cell. In that case, the thought processes inside the countless cells in your body are all the thoughts of warped human beings, and the entire body has become like that. This ties into why gods no longer regard man as human. When mankind is no longer human, what is the point of gods’ saving it?

You know that when a person dies, he doesn’t really die. The shell of the layer of the largest molecular particles sloughs off, whereas the part of the body composed of microcosmic particles below molecules hasn’t died. It is separated, as if a person takes off a piece of clothing. It isn’t really dead. Yet the person in this dimension has vanished, since the body needs to be cremated or buried and it will eventually decompose and dissolve. It has departed from this dimension; that is, this layer of particles has disappeared.

Then, as to the alien culture that I was just talking about, it is precisely using man’s own thinking to create the bodily layer that it needs, and it is doing so without man being aware of it. How will they ultimately replace human beings, then? You know that they still have to find a way to replace the shell of the outermost surface of human beings. This is the method of “cloning” that man now wants to use. Gods look after people, and when they don’t look after someone, they won’t instill the elements of life into that person.

This is to say, the reason you are alive in this world is not that you have this flesh body, nor is it because your mother gave you this body that you are alive. It is because you have your main spirit (yuanshen) and the existence of all of your other spirits (shen) that you can live. Why doesn’t a person keep living after he dies and the body is laid down there, since it’s the same body after all? It’s because all of his main spirits have left. That is, if a person isn’t given a spirit and isn’t allowed to reincarnate at the time of birth, he will still be dead after he is born. So what will happen? Aliens will enter.

This is the ultimate means that aliens will use to replace man— that is, cloning humans. Man is being used by aliens to destroy himself, yet he is not aware of it and is still protecting this science, destroying the human race. If humans are cloned en masse in the future, those beings will all be aliens that have reincarnated in human bodies, and there will be no more human race.”

""I’ve told you before that because of alien science and technology, one layer of the human body, one of the human body’s layers of particles, has been placed fully under the control of aliens. It consists entirely of alien planets’ elements, including numbers, mechanical structures, electronic components, and so on. It consists of that stuff. And those things are continually creating a warped effect. 

The large-scale modern industries brought about by science have impacted many low-level dimensions in the cosmos. In my Fa-rectification I’ve found that quite a large layer of the cosmos has been contaminated by those things. And those warped things have had a considerably large resisting effect in the Fa-rectification.""

Are there any redditors who claim to be abducted by aliens if then tell your story,0,0
Hum and Light,"My senior year of high school my best friend and I were at her home in Florida.  This is the part of my story where some credibility could be lost, my friend and I decided this particular day that we were going to make weed brownies.  I am not going to get into how they were made or even really focus on that.  After the brownies were done we ate a couple and then our day just disappeared.  I don't know what happened.  I just remember both of us waking up in her bed scared.  There was a bright light and a humming noise coming from outside of her window.  We were so scared, I remember her and I cuddling together and her saying, ""I will give you 20 dollars to go check on my family.""  Of course I declined.  This light was bright like someone was pulled up right next to her bedroom window and shining their car's brights into her room.  There was a hum, loud enough to be noticed- but yet no one else in her house woke up!  This is where the story gets weird.  Her bedroom window was behind tall bushes.  There was a tree almost directly in front of her window and a fence surrounding her property which was about 6 feet from the tree.  There is no possible way a vehicle could have been in her yard.  Her window and house were far enough from the road that even if a car was on the road shining it's brights in the direction of her window it could not be that dramatic.  The light and noise lasted what seemed like forever, but in reality was only several minutes.  For years, I forgot about the experience, well a better explanation is that I just didn't think about it and blamed the weed.  I lost an entire day of my life, and when i came to I was lying in a bed scared with a bright light shining into a window which wasn't feasible given the circumstances, accompanied by a humming.  If I was not abducted, my friend and I witnessed someone in her house being abducted.  What's even stranger is that, as an adult I realized I have this special ability to break electronics just by being near them or touching them.  I've always referred to myself as a ""white noise"".  After reading symptoms of abductees, I realized that it's common.  I've eaten weed brownies before and after, and nothing has ever happened to me like that before.  I'm a skeptic about the whole abduction thing, but this was unexplainable from a logical standpoint.  The fact that two of us experienced it- the same thing, one of us being a psychologist now, and the other working in journalism... just weird.  I felt like sharing my story might reach someone who had something similar happen and can share with me.

Possible abduction,"Around 6 months ago I was sleeping at my girlfriend's house and all of a sudden I saw blinding strobe lights and then I was on a hard, cold, metal table. A light that looked kind of like a dentist light was shining down on my face. I remember feeling helpless and scared. I kept seeing these big grey beings I don't think their intention was to really harm me I think they were just observing me and my reactions to my surroundings. They seemed curious but said nothing. They ended up running a test on my brain with a worm/centipede looking thing. They let it crawl in my nose and ears. It didn't hurt at all whatsoever. Once that was done i saw the blinding strobe lights and all of the sudden I was back at my girlfriend's house and I had a major migraine and my nose was bleeding. I'm want to dismiss it as a dream but it was so real feeling.",0

"I feel crazy, help me","I've been having weird nights the last 2 nights specifically. I wake up suddenly, my vision is - fuzzy, or almost pixelated - I feel intensly that someone is on my room. Last night I woke up to a dog barking, but it didnt sound like my dog, I wasnt sure if my dog was in my bed so I checked and he was sound asleep in his bed on the floor next to ours. I felt scared, I immediatley cuddled up to my husband who seemed restless himself. I didnt see any entites, but I could feel them, it felt like a phychic encounter. Its hard to explain but what I felt was something was trying to understand my consiousness and spirtuality, what makes me human. I felt an insect like presence, not an animal or human connection, like a being with no soul. Its weird because its an encounter based on feeling, instead of seeing anything. 
I feel terrified, I wake suddenly but cant get out if bed at night.
My feet were asleep one night, and freezing even though it wasnt cold. I heard my dog walking, but he was asleep. Our house is creaky & I do laundry at night, so there are justifiable noises. 
I took a survey on this sub today and answered yes to so many things. I have noticed scratches and cuts on my hip and thigh area, and thought I scratched myself. I used to get unexplained bruises. I noticed a large bump on my inner thigh, like a bug bite, and then today its gone. My dog constantly jumps up out of sleep, totally scared, and that has only happened since we moved into this house. For awhile, he would chase a nothing, like as if a rat was running through the house, he was very playful about it, and it was super creepy, my husband thought there must be a critter under our house (there is a crawl space)  Ive gotten nose bleeds lateley and that hasnt happened since I was a kid. I feel so tired and unmotivated, have a hard time working ( i work from home) 
I constantly see repeat numbers on the clock, everytime I look at it. 
The first night, when I woke up feeling a presence, I saw light, like moving around even though I had my sleep mask on, it was like lights were inside my eyes.
I felt as though, I was in my bedroom, but it wasnt my room, like I was under a facade / halucination to protect my memory, while I was infact somewhere else.
I also get a tingling sensation on my forehead, at random times.  

I feel crazy for considering aliens, I cant tell anyone, maybe my brother - he is a  bit out there, he has always maintained that he was taken as a kid. I remember when he was 5 or 6, he wouldnt sleep in his room and said there was an ""evil ET"" my parents just thought it was normal boogey man stuff and he started sleeping with my mom. He still maintains what he saw to this day, and like I said hes a bit out there. 

My husband will think im insane. What can I do? Im really scared and sad about this. 

Disclosure, I did ayahuasca 11 days ago, could this be lingering affects? Could I have opened my Psyche to unwanted entities?",0
Weird Dream,"This happened about a year ago and a half ago. I woke up in the middle of the night with a really strange feeling. It was like something wasn't right, I got up to get w glass of water and saw I had left the kitchen light on. I figured this must have been why I felt off,  so I cut off the light, got my water and when to back to sleep. Later I woke up...well I'm not sure if I did or not, it fell real, but I just don't know. I was woken up by a vibration on the side of my head, and a loud buzzing noise. The best thing I can compare it to is when your getting your hair cut with clippers. It felt and sounded like like that but it was extremely painful. I could not fully open my eyes and within seconds fell back asleep. Then I had the most vivid dream ive ever experienced. I woke up (in my dream), and clearly remember what I had just experienced. My first logical explanation was a friend or family member had snuck into my house and cut my hair as some kinda bad prank. So I jumped up and ran to my mirror to look, their was nothing, but I could still feel pain coming from the side of my head. It was bees had stung me multiply times in the same place. I started to have a panic attack, witch is something Iver never had before. Freaking out i made my way into my living room not knowing why I was so scared. Then I saw a bright light shining throw my bay window. Then I woke up, but again it was a dream. I asked my self out loud if this was real and started searching my night stand for my phone. This is when I woke up for real. I felt completely clam apon waking. I had a really strange feeling, like being high, not anything like on drugs, just a altered state of mind if that makes sense. This felling soon went away and got up for work and moved on from that night. I'm not sure if it was all a dream or not. I forgot about it for a while till I found this sub. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

My generalized and summed up experience,"I have had a number of strange circumstances and events surrounding me from time to time throughout my entire life but way more eventful during my childhood. Many of the things I tried to explain away and even forget but some were just to precise and or unique to shrug off. All kinds of things ranging from visions of the future to orbs of light with all kinds of crazy in the middle and to the side.

I really like /r/paranormal and have posted a few stories there. In fact it’s one of the few other places I have posted. My issue with the place is a feeling of people who believe they know it all and everything is a demon from the burning pits of hell. I’m sure thats not uncommon here and truthfully I respect opinions and welcome them however that is not a satisfactory answer and it leaves a lot to be desired in the topic of abductions or even aliens in general in my opinion.I don’t deny such things exist I just don’t really think everything is a demon because its mysterious. I can suck it up for possible spiritual entities but I don’t yet buy the idea that ALL aliens are demons. I think of reddit as a journal to document my experiences for people to read and or relate to as I do with theirs.

What made me want to post about this and prod the minds of others is because part of me wants to try regression. I recently read a list of 58 signs that you might have been abducted. I am not going to go over all of the signs I feel like I fit from the list but lets just say I really connected with this list (scored 41 out of 58). Some of it was unfitting but like most things in life results will vary.

http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread525151/pg1
I didn’t initially find the list here, it’s been a while and I don’t remember exactly where I found it but somebody else used the exact list here it seems.

__________
I don’t know with certainty that I have ever been taken. I can tell you however that ever since I was a little kid I knew I was much different that most kids. I was smart yet slow while being an outgoing introvert. I believed for the longest time I was mentally ill and that secretly my family didn’t want to tell me that I was suffering from some kind of mental illness like I was autistic or something. The ADHD really didn’t help me either. To this day I don’t believe I was ever tested for autism spectrum or anything like it. I did some pretty bizarre shit when I was a kid but I think that just happens in general. The good news is that for the most part I don’t feel slow anymore. In fact sometimes people just amaze me about how dumb they could be at times. Almost like when you start slower but ultimately push the faster speed.

Lets get to the good stuff. The list included but was not limited to a variety of items. you should review from the link. Some I didn’t fit because I am a male or because I am not a daddy or because they were dependent on other people.  What makes me so damn curious that I might have been abducted is because when I was little I was certain that I was. I don’t remember the details but I could tell you about them then. I told my friends about it. I guess thats why I didn’t have many. I wasn’t being fed this shit from any family or friends honestly and the only TV I watched was weekend cartoons and NES games. I also am “O-“ and I just found out that is significant. Also throughout my life I have heard and seen things in my room and outside my window “be they spiritual in nature or beings of sorts or UFOs”. I have woken up to scrapes and scares that took a week or two to go away and one I can never forget and will post an illustration of ranging from blue to orange in color and often with a raised puffy nature but never painful at all. Sometimes they would be in locations I cannot reach with my own hands or appear under clothing that I would have needed to be taken off.

The last scar I ever got was puffy like raised skin in the shape of a face almost. It was like a rough simple cartoon of an alien head. It was the most bizarre one I ever got. I was 18 when it happened living in my birth city of Redding Ca. I actually took a picture with my 1MP digital camera (WOOOOT!) But I lost it years ago along with some other pictures I will always miss that cannot be replaced.

I slept in my underwear that night. I had a belt but it was hanging in my closet and I did’t need it much those days unless for looks in most cases. When I woke up the scar was on my right hip area. I immediately went to the kitchen to get coffee and my mother was up doing the same. She thought it was weird but that it had to be from my belt. She does not believe in anything odd or supernatural (everything is a demon or angel with her). The scar was not at all painful but it was raised pretty high. it was red like in nature and lasted for about 3 weeks. This was one of the last ones I ever got and or remember.

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54906720/The%20Mark.png
This is the image i roughly illustrated. It’s very accurate but not perfect. It gets the point across but the actual scar was more on point to my description. It was about 1-1.5 inches in vertically on my hip. To be clear there was a thing to be seen in my room that fit this design and like I said it was raised skin and not an impression. Also remember it did not hurt but it lasted for weeks on end. It somewhat reminds me of something like a weird wall socket cable end. I have awoken to a few dots in triangle formation as well as square ones. Often those ones were not raised but just discolored and again temp.
__________

I have experienced what is scientifically called Sleep paralysis while I did I witnessed and heard creatures present. I was and sometimes still am terrified of stupid shit that should not startle someone. I was woken up in various odd places in my house or even in the wrong house (grandmas). I have seen many a sightings too and shared some of those sightings with others at the time I saw them. Used to sleepwalk and have night terrors galore. I often still talk in my sleep but I don’t think these last things are too too nuts. I have and sometimes still do dream of being around aliens or crafts. I sometimes dream I can fly. But it used to terrify me because something would make it awful like loosing control mid flight or falling to my death. I used to do in all my dreams as a child if not something very terrible happen instead.

I am curious if anyone in my position would look into regression or if you believe the therapy is bogus. Also if you think it’s crap I am curious if you think you know of something better and more effective. Also flat out generalized commends and answers are welcomed. I am open to ideas and answers whatever you think they might be (even if you think they are demons). I need to know if there are people in my position that have done it and ultimately feel it was worth it. I cannot remember being abducted and as a child kids say all kinds of crazy shit.

Weird dream,"Hello Reddit I've come to you for some help and maybe other people have experienced the same thing please let me know.

Ok so I had this dream about a year ago and I was recently reminded by time hop about it and it's one of those dreams that you remember very clearly. So here's what I remember: I was in my apartment alone (which was strange because I have a big family living here) and I felt an uneasy tension I was walking towards my kitchen and I saw through the outside window nothing but an orange sky like if there was a fire near by. Fast forward a bit and I hear something coming towards my front door and in my dream I have never felt the sensation of me stepping on something but I felt the cold touch of my tile floor in the kitchen and I backed myself into a corner to grab my knife and when what ever was coming close to my door ran off I have never felt nervous or scared for my life before in a dream and I remember waking up being skeptical if this was real life or not. Another weird thing is my friend had a similar dream the same night so it scared me even more. 

What do you guys think though?

tl;dr I had a dream I almost got abducted but it felt to real to be a dream and a friend of mine had a similar dream that added to be being skeptical if this was real life or not ",0

Abducted?,"HI people of reddit, I have an “abduction” story. Now its important to say that I’ve never seen an alien or anything for that matter. But I have experienced some really weird shit. Okay here it goes back in the mid 90’s I live in a small town near Mexico city where it really wasn't as populated as it is now in days but my story starts one day that I got back home and went to sleep and after a couple of seconds after closing my eyes I felt stiff the best way that I can describe it as would be as if stiff as a board because I couldn't move anything the only thing I could do was breath and move my eyes. But I could only see in black in white  I couldn't see anything in color and I could also hear i the back something I could best describe as glass breaking or bottles been moved around immediately followed by me been levitated I could i actually see the selling getting closer to me but I always got so scared that would shut my eyes and i could see trough my shut eye a big bright light and that is it, I would wake up the very next day with a horrible pain in my stomach I would wake up gasping for air as if a mule had kicked me in the gut. Where this shit gets scary as fuck is that one day my neighbor asked me If I was doing work on my roof because he would see bright lights coming out of my roof i just answered him… no dude no, you must have been tripping because I didn't see shit and played it off as if everything was cool but deep inside of my i was shitting my self and i wanted to run home and hug my mom! But wtf was i going to tell her? that some weird shit was happening? no! So i just kept it to my self and sucked up. This continued to happen to me off and on for a couple of years. it hasn't happened to me lately, I can say that one the scariest things is the levitating part that shit feels is the scariest feeling I have ever felt.",0

Personal - Has anyone else seen the blue room?,"I don't talk about this a lot, but I have been thinking lately and I want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience, so I made this account to scope things out I guess. 

I should start by saying that my earliest memory is from when I was around 18 months old. I would try to climb out of my crib and take off my onesie, as a lot of little kids do. I remember everything very clearly. My mom pinned my PJs on with a turtle safety pin that I could never get off because it was too strong. This isn't relevant to the supposed encounters, but I feel like it's worth mentioning since I hear most peoples' earliest memories are from when they were three or four, not one and a half. 
At around two or three, I would often ask my parents where my ""other parents"" were. I seem to remember saying something like, ""They look just like you but they're not you"" or something. My dad thought I had lived a past life (he's buddhist or something), and he was pretty pumped about that. (I do have memories from a ""past life,"" but I don't remember my ""parents."")
When I was four or five, some really weird things started to happen to me. I would be in bed and I would see my parents holding hands, walking into my room at night, and they'd look over my bed, then smile at each other as if they were admiring me, like I was some great success, and then I would blink and they would be gone, or I would just black out or something. My parents didn't really ever hold hands, like, ever. 
Maybe that's what I meant when I was referring to my other parents. Maybe I saw them when I was really, really little, too. Getting shivers thinking about it. (Now that I'm thinking about it, I seem to remember it happening from very early on, but I can't remember anything clearly.)
Other nights, I would get into bed, then I would blink and it would suddenly be 
morning. I wouldn't feel as if I had slept, either. I wasn't exhausted, but I just felt like no time had passed at all. 
I would also see lights outside my window, but I lived in the middle of the woods. I don't know if this is a memory from when I lived in the suburbs and there was an antenna just outside my house, but it sure felt like it happened while I was in the woods. 

Here's the bit that had me realizing it might be extraterrestrial related. 
Some nights I would have dreams in the thirdperson perspective about being abducted by aliens, and I remember distinctly what my location looked like. It was a cylindrical blue room about the size of a classroom with spotlights all around the floor, pointed at me. The floor was firm but spongy in texture, like gym pads. The light diffusion in the room was strange and almost didn't make sense to me. 
When I was in the room, I almost always had on my pajamas. I was wearing my little pink fleece nightgown with baby harp seals printed all over it, or my faux silk one with little pinkish roses all over it. Other lights would flash on. I felt like I was being watched by more than one person, or being. I would look around and see nobody, and then the floor would open up abruptly and I would fall back down. It was like I was watching it from over a camera, a fixed point in a room. I think in some of my dreams I would start to walk around, but then I would fall anyway. 
Being dropped down always gave me the sense that I was being examined to see if I was ""ready."" Like I was supposed to be preparing for something, and the last time they set me down they decided I wasn't ""ready"" yet, or that I was ineligible. 

I intuitively knew a lot of things that normally kids my age didn't know, and I had no explanation for how I knew them. Most prominently, I what periods were. I knew about a few of the US presidents when I was only in the beginning of my kindergarten years. I was easily upset by other peoples' suffering and still have a crazy sense of empathy. As I got older and family problems began to happen, I had this disturbingly clear image of the bigger picture in my mind... how the world would be if humans weren't so petty, if we didn't fight over every little insignificant thing. At eight years old, I became aware of how small my existence was in the universe, and how I wanted to make a difference. I wanted everything to be better, and I wanted to make people stop fighting. My parents, my relatives, my friends... everyone. I wanted the fighting to stop. I still do. 
I've always had trouble telling people what I think about this ""bigger picture"" and how so many things are insignificant to the world, but still everything is important, and how everything is supposed to add up to something. 
I include this because I've heard that people who have abduction stories talk about warnings from their abductors. I haven't gotten any warnings, but I feel like I'm supposed to be a guardian. I feel like I'm meant to help people, help this planet. It's a very scary feeling. 

Only in recent years have I actually thought anything of these occurrences when I started looking into alien abduction stories. Stories about weird dreams and lost hours in particular. My visions of my parents make me wonder how aliens would approach children without alarming them. I was always bothered by words like ""brain"" and ""mind,"" as if there was something I was supposed to be hiding, and after I turned seven, I hated to talk about the ""past life"" I had.  

I stopped having these sorts of occurrences and dreams happen to me when I entered school and began worrying about social things. When I was 14, I started taking antidepressants, and almost everything relative to this diminished because I was worrying about other things. But now I'm trying to get off of them, and it's like things are coming back and making sense with each dose lower I go. 

I blamed my overactive imagination for all this. That could be all this is; just me overthinking everything I saw, since I did have some hallucinations at that age. 

But I feel like I need to know if any of you have felt this, experienced these things.  

I may be leaving things out because I haven't thought about so much of this in such a long time, but I'll update with whatever I remember at whatever time. I'll try and make sketches and upload them someplace or another.  

Does anyone else have similar experiences to this? I really would like to know. 

Thanks for reading.

[Personal] Alien hand print left on window,"I'd like to start this post with some much needed UFO history/backstory:

- I've had intense phobia of standard alien images since early ages of 5 (first time I saw E.T.) I can look at pictures of the Alien franchise xenomorphs no problem, but the more Grey-like and spindly they are, I physically feel sick just looking at. That Communion book cover is terrifying. 

- I used to have sleeping problems with 2 recurring nightmares of seeing a UFO in the sky outside my room at parent's house. I'd then rush downstairs to check the conservatory is locked (it is not) and when I go to grab the handle and lock it, I see a very long-fingered Grey hand grasp the handle. I always wake up then. The second dream was just literally me being in a room with a thick set about 6-7 foot fall Grey, and a RIDICULOUSLY long limbed spindly grey that takes up the whole room, it's head craning down over the shoulder of the other one. It was impossible to look away from, not matter how hard I tried.

- I took sleep therapies, and eventually learnt a few life-saving lucid dream hacks so I could change the dream/wake myself up as soon as I noticed the recurring features beginning to manifest.

- When I came to tell parents about the sleep problems, Mum revealed that she'd seen something similar. She swears down that a week after my early birth, she checked on me every hour during the night that I was still alive. One night I'd been particularly bad, she came in and swears down that she saw 'a wingless angel' who took up the whole room, standing over my bed, bent double. She stared at its face and remembers nothing else but an androgynous face she cannot even draw. She said without moving its lips, somehow it told her everything was fine and that she could go back to sleep. She did. She thought it was an angel back then, but now she's not so sure.

- Alien nightmares hadn't bothered me since 2009 but in November 2013 that changed.

Nov 2013 - My Student flat (not family home) 

I wake up from a nightmare in which aliens were trying to get into the house I was living in with 5 other girls. The first thing I did was check my door - I had a safety go lock on it all the time, especially when I slept. It hadn't moved.
It was about 6am and I didn't have class till 12 so I listened to my ipod till I could sleep again.

When I woke again from my actual alarm at 9, I go to open the curtains, and [find this on the window](http://i.imgur.com/fvgsq9N.jpg)

I remember staring at it for a good few minutes  feeling sick. I have no long nails and never will because I'm gross and bite them. The shape was so distinct and the nail so clear it weirded me out.

I woke up the three other housemates still at home. They honestly did not know what to make of it.TBH I think one girl finally clocked why I had immediately turned down the downstairs patio-door bedroom when we'd assigned rooms (too many conservatory flashbacks there).

To double check that it hadn't been us or whatever for my piece of mind really, I had us all attempt to recreate the hand print.
http://i.imgur.com/Lu85w2M.jpg

The original print is just to the right of the butterfly window charm.

Wondered if anyone else has experienced something like this before? To this day everyone kind of just brushes it off with 'wow that is bizarre' but it honestly scares me - the idea that something could have been in my locked room right next to me and done that. Also wondering if it has anything to do with the thing my mother saw or whether she was just sleep deprived, but either way Dad backed up her claim that she'd told him at the time.

No idea why an alien would fly x amount of distance to come leave a weird shape on my window, but maybe I'd rather not know.



Sorry if the format is off but it's my first post on this sub and I have no idea what I'm doing :'D",0
What Does An Alien Abduction Look Like?,0,0
abduction in South eastern New Hampshire,"This is my story on how I was abducted possibly. I am not for sure what happened but this is the only thing I could think of that would make sense so I decided to put it on here and hear what other people have to say. 

     I live in a very small town in New Hampshire USA. Near Dover (If you wear that is and if you don't a reference point). I own an ATV and ride it every now and again. Sometimes with my friends. In my mind this is where it all started. I was with my friends Zack and Deacon at a race way in that area the next town over. Very small lots of country folk like myself. You know the type carhartt working pants bright orange shirt that is one size to big and Chippewa boots. We were up in the VIP box cause my friends dad works for Pepsi which is a sponsor and we are standing out on the wooden balcony. We are a light just hovering in the distance and it goes back and fourth and just keeps going up and down. At one point it disappears then reappears. We thought that was weird so we ignored it. We waited for fireworks to start and right as they did it vanished and never returned. I the next day me and my other friend Cam where riding out ATVs all day in the trails that go on back of my house and lead to snowmobile trails that we are not suppose to be on. It gets late and since this is summer time it's about 9 o'clock at night and it gets dark. We rush back to our houses. I crashed me ATV the year previous and after a year of trying to put the front end back together I say screw it and don't and just get New plastics and leave it be. Because of this I don't have head lights so my friend has to be in front. When we are a mile or two from my house my ATV hear light to out. ""Shorter a fuse I said to myself"". Then I see what seem to be an aircraft of some sorts. Hexagonal is the best I could put it. It hovers above me and my friend and he zooms off as I slow down some how to a dead stop. Now I'm in the middle of the woods far away from home with no lights. The crafts let's out a beam of blinding light. All I see is white like in the movies. Then it goes out and as my eyes readjust to the dark I realize it is way darker then it was before. ""My eyes must be still adjusting"" I think to myself. I get home didn't check my phone once in thought that my eyes will adjust to the light. I get home to my parents hugging me asking me where I've been. ""Just out back with cam. Mom I told you this at 10 in the morning don't you remeber?"" 
""Honey it's 2 in the morning. What else happend to you?"" 
""I don't know. Wait it's what time?"" 
I look at the clock and it's 2:26 am 
""Mom... I... I don't know.... What's going on?""
""Can we can discuss this in the morning?"" 
""Fine."" 
I get in the shower feeling like when you wake up from an hour nap and you wake up just before rem sleep and you feel like crap. I get to bed and fall asleep as soon as I got under the covers. I wake up in the morning and Google what I experienced and came up with alien abduction. It said any new scares or cuts and after about 5 mins on searching I found one on my finger. Faint but still able to make out. If I could as a picture I could. Just tell me and I will send you one if you want. 
Thank you for reading this if you made it this far.",0
"Personal - Weird experience when I was younger, anyone see it too?","Here's an experience I had when I was younger:

I was about 12 years old, I was up at night, trying to fall back asleep, not sure what time. We had a fluorescent light in the hallway that we used as a (overkill) nightlight, and the indirect light from it would get cast onto the wall wood paneling beside my bed. I was staring at it, trying to get back to sleep, then I saw a shadow flicker, literally flicker, past the light. I completely freaked out and hid under my blankets saying ""what the fuck"" and ""what the fuck was that"" over and over and over. Today when looking back at that moment I still don't know what was the big deal or why it scared me so much.

The weird thing that happened was that a light flew in in between my blankets and my mattress and flashed me in the face like a camera. Just like getting a flash in the face in a dark room, I was blinded for a few seconds, during this time I was pulling away my blankets so I could see the top of the bunk bed. Like seeing a weld flash, it left a ""trace"" of the light I saw, [this is what it looked like](http://i.imgur.com/FB7CQJh.png). After I could see again, I decided to go to sleep, just like nothing happened.

Has anyone else have the same type of experience? Does anyone know what the image means? I've been wondering if it's the eyes and sides of the face of a grey. I can't say for sure since it was lit and I couldn't tell any other characteristics besides what the flash looked like.

Bits of memory keep coming back,"
Hello guys. I'm not sure where to start. There is quite alot of information that even I have a hard time accepting. I've read up alot on the forums (as much as I can read in a few hours), and have found alot of similarities in my story. I'll try to start from the beginning. I see alot of people that have had clear memories with vivid details, and most have been happening for years. Mine comes in bits and pieces and just started recently. 

I would say the whole thing started happening about two weeks ago. I woke up really startled in the morning from some really crazy dreams. I'm a vet who's been deployed, and most of my dreams have to do with previous happenings there. That's why this one really shook me up. I can't remember everything about it, but I remember really clearly seeing a smokey filled doorway with a greyish being staring at me. I've seen pictures of ""greys"" but this one had a wider head with a blue tint to it. There were others there too, but i dont remember them well. It was as if they were showing themselves to me. I usually would have been really frightened by this, but I almost felt as if that was being repressed somehow. The dream ended with me cruising first person above a canal with trees canopied over it. That was it. I woke up really shaken.

After that night, my girlfriend had these huge bruises all over the back of her leg. She has been complaining alot about her eye bothering her in the morning too. Like it hurts to even wash her face. Today she also woke up with a huge rash covering her chest. I don't think it could be the detergent we use, because we haven't changed the brand in a while. I'll post the picture of her leg at the bottom. I don't think the bruise could have been from me kicking her or bumping into something, because she would CLEARLY wake up with the size that this bruise covers. 

At night I always feel as if something is watching me. I think of it as straight out of a horror movie when I go to check my other rooms. It runs through my head when i see some dummy going to check behind a door where Jason or Freddy is hiding. Nevertheless something does a really good job at making me think somethings there. We have a dog, and I figured the dog would be alerted to this as well. He's not. I'm not a great sleeper. I've had sleeping problems since i've been out of the service. Late at night I watch my dog, which usually sleeps through the whole night, get up and walk around. Just looking, not barking, standing in the same place everynight and then coming back to lay down. 

I've been waking up, when I do sleep, with horrible pains in my ankle. Last night I dreamt of my old squad with me, around the same street where I grew up. Our Platoon Sergeant made me and two others take off our shirts while he poked me in the back to get skin samples off me. I could almost feel the prick in my dreams. I don't know what to make of it. Either that, or i'm in denial. I'm not sure if I want this to be true, or to chalk it up to bad dreams and coincidences",0
Need help explaining mysterious surgical clips!,"I'm new to reddit and am wondering if anyone has had the same experience as a family friend. After suffering from extreme stomach pain she went in for an x ray, they found a mass of tissue on her uterus, and then repeatedly asked if she has ever had back surgery. She was confused and they told her that she had two surgical clips in her back. She says she has never had surgery for anything. It seems like the mass isn't serious and the pain will be easy to fix, but the clips remain a mystery. Any similar stories or ideas?  ",0
Please help: I think my wife is being routinely abducted,"For several years now, my wife has been accumulating more and more characteristics of a long-term repeat abductee.

* Insomnia
* Frequent night hallucinations (hypnogogic dreams) of intruders in the house; sleepwalking
* Sleep paralysis
* Long-term unexplained illnesses, resistant to therapies and medication
* Grids of dots on skin upon waking (only twice, a few years ago) (still trying to find the photos)

She is not a believer in this kind of phenomena, and I've only recently started putting the pieces together. She pooh-poohs my suspicions, and so I don't bring it up anymore.

I'm in a terrible place. I'm sickened at the thought of her being victimized in the way I've read in the case studies. And bittersweetly, if she *is* a repeat abductee, I'm in a place to actually run experiments on preventative measures and/or gathering more evidence.

This is the one place I thought I'd find sympathetic folks with some ideas on what I should do.",0
No where to run no where to hide 2,"Sorry I have to admit it really is strange sharing all this I tryed and succeeded to forget what I remembered for a long while. The morning after the  incedent I woke up on the floor in my mom's room I remember being confused opon  awakening  couldn't remember why I was in moms room. Mom said I had a nightmare and came in her room last night.  I didn't remember anything of it at that time but after that night I began to have recurring nightmares and would often sleep walk around the house and turn all the lights on and TV , a couple months later  I was sick with strep and I was laying on the coach watching a nature show on pbs I was in between being asleep and awake when the events of that evening flashed in my mind I seen it all I didn't understand it at that time , no not then..          I told my mom she said it was all just a dream..but I didn't tell her everything I knew as I felt like it was just to weird and she definitely wouldn't believe me, iv never told any one what I saw until now.          While in moms room on the floor by the water bed , I seen a head of what looked like a giant grass hopper or mantis. As soon as I saw it it was beside me I couldn't move I felt like I was falling off a building or something like falling.. but I was hovering over my mom's bed, they were up looking at me but they couldn't move either. .
I got really frightened but I couldn't scream I started to feel as if I might die just then I heard a voice the same voice in my dreams, it said.   ""do not be afraid we are not here to harm anyone just relax"" and I felt calm at that moment,  I felt kinda sick to my stomach from the falling feeling but I was calm I started to float up further I remember thinking ,, I'm gonna hit the ceiling and it's gonna hurt,, but instead of  hitting the ceiling, I went through it...nothing broken just went right through the roof of the house..I knew there were other beings with me I just couldn't move my head to see them but I knew that there was a weird giant insect next to me , as soon as I cleared the roof I saw the ""egg"" shaped thing,, orange glowing really bright and in an instant I was on a metalized table,  but it was warmed..and comfortable, I still couldn't move but I was able  to move my right hand from the wrist down and now I could move my head side to side. The room was dim and it stinks like garbage and  rotten eggs, slowly the room began to light up, not from a lightbulb more like the walls and the ceiling and the floors were lighting up . the room was glowing, my eyes hurt me but slowly my eyes become adjusted to the bright light it was a really strange light it wasn't like anything I've ever seen there was no shadows with this light..very strange... I remember noticing  the walls were silver Chrome Lit up with a  weird white glowing light resonating from them..the walls ceiling and floors all conected and the room was circular it was much larger than the egg shaped object I saw so I figured I wasn't inside the glowing egg I must be somewhere else? But I was really dreamy feeling and didn't dwell on it, there were small what I assumed were round doors all a round the room the doors were like little ""hobbit"" doors,, small and oval. Or arched. they had no knob either,  I was thinking why is this place so smelly but looks soo clean. ??  Mainly because I was all weird feeling all doped up feeling.. I should've been trying to get outta there but no,, I was just wondering why it stank so dam bad. ?,  all of a sudden I seen the door to my left slide  up really fast . Then the one on my right out came a group of mantis like  creatures looking similar to each other but different,, they came swarming out of the doors really fast and zoomed around the room little holes opened up on the walls and these little guys would run up to the holes and pulled out a purple hose like thing, then they would run up and atach them to the underside of the table, the creatures were small 3 ft tall mostly greenish but also some what blueish..a taller one squeezed through and stood up it was at least 6' tall..it was on my left side it bent over the table and looked down at me in my mind I heard it say ""the pain will not last long"" and it very quickly atached a square  black plate like object on the palm of my right  hand it hurt like hell felt like burning and then stopped hurting and started to feel soothing, then I felt a pinch in both calf muscles and in my forearms,  I began to feel really good I remember I was smiling and all these ugly things were running around me doing who knows what  but at that point it didn't bother me one bit. A thin clear piece of I thought was  glass appeared above my head I didn't see it before so I think maybe it came out of the ceiling it floated down to about a foot away from my face and shinned a blue light directly into my eyes I blinked  and felt compelled to look into this blue light it then started to make pictures a video of sorts except it's clearer than real life, best I can explain... the video was showing plants and showing the plant seed  grow then die in fast motion, it showed insects going through there life span, then it showed animals a lion mating with a lioness,  horses mating with horses I saw the sperm and the egg the entire  growth patterns of these animals in the womb. I felt exhilarated the emotions were extremely overwhelming the animals also died and decomposed into the earth then grass would sprout up  then other animals would come by and graze on it. it was all very strange of course,. Then it showed me a man and a woman having sex , I felt really weird and kinda like why am I seeing this? Than I heard a voice say "" life must flourish"" 3 times I heard this..I then started to see the earth from orbit on the screen the earth looked normal then I saw the earth move slightly and when it did it displaced the oceans I could clearly see the oceans move violently I then seen smoke and large fires all over the planet..it was very terrifying to watch but what I saw next was worse it seemed as if I was watching the planet in fast motion so not long after the planet tilting and the oceans flooded everything I seen rockets launching from all over the planet they were nuclear and they destroyed everything that was still alive after the flood.. I was sobbing uncontrollably  I felt  like I didn't want to live it wasn't worth it..then a voice said.                              ""life will be preserved""  and I blacked out. That was my first incident with ""THEM""... . . .",0
No where to run no where to hide...,"I am new to this so I ask only for leniency if I screw up here..but I want to share something that iv never shared to anyone before.in fear people will think me clinically insane, so what better a way than to share it here anonymously.  I am Cymatx1 I am 40 years of age, male, a product of the 1970s , at an early age my dad left me and my mom so I always felt like I had to be strong for her because she was always crying on my shoulder about how my father had left us and deserted us I was only four or five..anyway mom met a new guy fresh out of the Marine Corps..they got married soon after, we moved to a place called del-comino a trailer park just east of Longmont Colorado next to Highway I-25, we live in a single-wide  green trailer on Grove street my room was at the far. North part of the trailer, my parents room was at the other end in between was the kitchen and living room , I was about 8 years old when one night while in bed I heard someone calling my name it was a soft and comforting voice calling me I walked down the hall trying to figure out where the voice was coming from it sounded like it was coming from outside so I unlocked the door open the screen door walked out onto our big red patio that my stepfather had built but when I got to the edge of the patio I looked over and I saw that there was nothing there I mean nothing there was no ground there was no cars there was no other trailers there was just the patio and me I remember freaking out crying out loud and then all of a sudden something grabbed me and when it did it grabbed my shoulder and I felt extream pain radiating through my entire body suddenly I came to and I realize that I was outside on the patio naked and my stepfather was spanking the hell out of me for going outside at 2 o'clock in the morning that was pretty weird but not as weird as what happened the next night...the evening after dinner and a movie we rented vhs tapes from block buster video at that time..we watched superman with Christopher Reeves and then I went to bed..instead of dreaming I was superman flying around this is how it went..a voice, soft comforting, calling my name this time coming from my window my window faced the street, I had no curtain so it was  always lit up in my room a little from the orange glowing street lights, but when I opened my eyes to see who was calling me I noticed the room was really bright orange and I sat up in my bed which was directly across from the window  and through the window was an orange glowing egg?!? About 10 feet diameter. .floating above Grove street about 10 feet of the ground, I couldn't figure out wat it was I didn't think of a space ship or aleins at the time I just watched it..hover, . Then it got even brighter like the sun, i felt heat one my exposed skin.. I got really scared at that point but I couldn't move...I felt frozen sitting up in bed facing the object in the window, then I felt a tingling sensation all over me I looked down at my chest and noticed  small ant like insects?  But they were metallic about the size of ants but looking mire like tiny rectangles,. They were crawling all over me my legs face chest and arms and I could not move I was terrified! !. Just then the"" robot ants"" disappeared into thin air all at the same time the light dimmed and I could move again but for some reason  I layed back down and pulled the covers over my head, the voice was no longer there but I  felt a presence in the room with me I was petrified I began to think that I got to get to my mom's room quik!! But I was so afraid of what ever was in the room with me that I was really having a hard time getting the courage to do it..finally I gathered enough guts to throw the covers off and jump up to my feet I looked at the window there were 4 beings just like the so called greys in the middle of the street they all turned and looked at me all at the same time and  in 1 split second one of them was at my window staring at me it's movement was so fast I could not see it move from the street to my window I freaked out screamed and started to turn and run when I heard a crash in my closet, ,at that point I wasn't sticking around for the next suprize...I high tailed it down the hall through the kitchen jumping over the couch and straight into my mom and step dad's room..dad not to happy at this point but mom new I was really upset so she gave me a blanket and pillow and I laid down on the floor next to their water bed . A was feeling calmer and started to fall asleep then I heard somthing in the room...I screamed  mom!! mom!! but they didn't wake up I said it louder neither of them woke up, I heard shuffling in the room and then a bang against the  water bed I looked down towards the foot of the bed and suddenly a big ugly insect like head popped out it was crawling on the floor at the foot of the bed....and that is where it all started...thanks for listening.

Guys... I think I was abducted by the Greys last night...,"This happened around 4-6 in the morning.
I was in a Lucid Dream, I usually astral travel during my sleep, my dreams are so real that I confuse them with memories. 
A little back story, I have never given much thought or research on Aliens because I am terrified of them, I do know they exist, but up until today I lived my life paying no mind to them, simply because I want nothing to do with them and not be under their radar. 
Back to the story.
The ""dream"" started when I was walking through this museum about aliens, more specifically, all about the Greys. After leaving the main room, we ended up being inside this room, I was strapped on a hospital bed, these doctors didn't look human, their voices were different, extremely tall, very cold.
They kept poking me and testing me, I remember being terrified, crying, begging to stop. 
That is when the put something in both of my arms and said-
""Your pain level is going to be on max-""
I screamed and cried begging them to stop, with no success. They were clicking buttons which transmitted an extremely weird kind of pain, agonizing. They did that a couple of times after a while they let me go. 
Still feel like i'm being watched. 

I woke up with a bruise on my leg and both my arms were numb. 

What the hell happened last night??!!  ",0
"Do you dream of making contact with ETs a reality for human beings on Earth? Develop telepathically... Be kind, refine your ego...","To change the face of human psychology completely…

Psychic mediumship and telepathy is expressed throughout pop culture. What this means is that other human beings are expressing their observations about reality through art. Art is a powerful medium which can heighten awareness in other individuals very quickly. Artists take their own life experiences and inner realities and display them for the public to see. Awareness of ESP is expressed over and over and over again in the artistic world. It's time to own up to the truth and be real: we are all psychic. Telepathy is real, and it should be used well (with kindness). We are all psychic mediums, and when we believe in ourselves, we can connect with the spirit world directly telepathically. We don't need religions, other psychics, or authority figures to tell us what reality is. We have our own observations, and when we open our minds to new information, more confirming experiences about the truth of reality. There is no death. There is a difference between being extremely confident in our observations and expressing this confidence to other people, and being authoritative. Think for yourself. Question authority. Do the right thing.

Before we play this game / 
I like to feel you break from inside / 
You’re gold and pink inside / 
And it’s showing through your stare / 
It’s frozen us in time from inside /

my childhood,"I lived in a house that was remolded when I was 8ish.  About that time wired things began to happen. It was believed to be haunted. First my sister began seeing a boy enter her room at night. She had seen him out side her window (2nd story). My father began seeing a shadow child enter his bedroom while he was resting. Our two dogs barked at the walls and chased things around the house. Ghosts!!

Except for me. I saw strange lights outside my window one night. I opened the shad and saw a common grey looking at me. I was calm and felt at peace. I saw them frequently in my room. Hiding in the corners looking at me. 
I got a pet ferret and it was caged at night. I saw a reptile like creature standing behind my bedroom door. My mother opened the door to check on me, the creature seem to evade into the wall as she opened the door. When she closed it the creature came forward. It was very interested in the ferret and inspected the cage. it then turned to me, this was the first time I felt fear around one of them. it moved over to me and looked down at me. That is all I remember. the next morning, getting ready for school my mother pointed out bruises and scratches on my back.
Anther creature I saw illumined its own light ,but did not light up the room, and was standing next to the head of my bed. When I noticed it the creatures eyes got wider or more opened as if i was surprised. 

I dont remember anything after seeing them.

My family still talks about how the house was haunted and the strange noises and the tv changing channels. Our friends who visited and stayed over night are witnesses to some of the strange happenings.

so, did we have ghosts or aliens...guess we will never find out. The only thing we all agree on it that house was special.",0
Terrifying dreams of being abducted came back,"Not sure if this is where I should be posting this, if this isn't the right place please point me in the general direction.

When I was younger I was obsessed with ufo's and aliens. Like most kids in their early teens I would imagine. I would stay up past 9pm and watch shows like UFO files, Unsolved Mysteries, and similar programs.

I can't tell you if the fascination came first, or the dreams. Lost time litters my past, some of that time lost can be easily explained as blacking out during binge drinking at 17 or the like. But some of this missing time goes all the way back to when I was in elementary school and cannot be explained by such things.

I used to have some of the most vivid dreams. Some of these dreams were of being taken by aliens. Dreams where an object stays outside my house, outside a store where I am with my friends or family, or just the lights or sounds. These dreams were always accompanied by beings coming for me and sometimes others in my dreams as well. These have been some of the most vivid dreams I have ever experienced in my life. I wouldn't start panicking in these dreams until I would see the beings, entities or whatever you want to call them, then I would really panic until they would get close enough to me, then I would *usually* just wake up. I do remember some where I did not immediately wake up but care not to recall those. None of these experiences or dreams were or would ever be pleasant. I knew this almost instinctively at some level. 

As I got older I started to dislike the subject and try to ignore it altogether. It was an almost irrational aversion as I hit my mid to late 20's. A fear. I'm in my 30's now and have 3 children. My oldest son who is 13 shares my earlier passion or unnatural obsession with aliens and ufo's.

I don't remember exactly when the last dream I had was. Sometime into my late teens they were getting so frequent I was having them almost nightly. And then they slowly petered out in my early to mid 20's I guess. I remember once I got a good enough look at one in one of those dreams and ever since then I would see them everywhere. In dark rooms, the corners of my eye. Anywhere there was a shadow I would see them. I refused to sleep with the lights out until I was in my late 20's. A grown man sleeping with not just a nightlight. I would keep the hallway and bathroom lights on too. I would freak out if I had to enter a dark room for any more than a moment and always run as fast as I could out of them. I was terrified of what I was positive was there but could not see.

Last night was the first time in years I have had a dream like this. As always, I would try to run from them, and fight them when I could. If you can even call it fighting, more like an ant trying now to get stepped on. Trying my best to keep them away from me, because as soon as they would touch me or get close enough to touch me, I would wake up in my bed, or come to in a weird place. Truly terrifying, even in a dream when you are unable to remember what happened. 

I woke myself up last night shouting out the name of my youngest son during this nightmare. I was taken several times at first in my dream and could clearly see the ufo in the dream. It looked a lot like the one from close encounters but much bigger and a lot less lights. A much more pronounced upside down pyramid shape with horizontal spires jutting out around the middle with a more domed shape at the top. The whole thing seemed to be in sections. At one point it was so close to me that I was unable to move and was holding onto a nearby fence with every ounce of effort I had. This was in broad daylight unlike most of the other dreams where I would be taken. Broad freaking daylight. There were 2 other people with me consistently in this dream but not anyone that I recognized. I had begged one of them to come and grab me to help get me away but they were just as terrified as I was, and were also trying to run. They were getting taken too. When the things started coming out of the base of the ufo I woke up in my bedroom. Unaware that I was still dreaming, hearing the eerie pulsing sound of the ufo from my bed, unable to move. I panicked and started shouting out for my youngest son instinctively but he never came to me. After shouting for him a few more times I actually woke myself up from shouting for him. It was that hoarse half whimper sound that comes out in a nightmare when you try to yell for help but nothing really seems to come out. As soon as I was able to muster enough strength to shout his name at the top of my lungs I had woke myself up mid shout. I immediately checked his room which is right next to mine and he was fine. So were my other 2 kids.

I just finished chain smoking about half a pack of cigarettes to calm my nerves down. During that time I was debating internally whether or not I should post this to a subreddit. Part of me wants to believe it is just a dream, some sort of manifestation of my own fears or some stupid shit like that. Part of me is absolutely terrified at the possibility that these could be memories of actual things that happened leaking into my dreams. Another part of me is afraid of what posting this might cause. Will the dreams start coming back now because I am actively thinking about them again? Is seeing those things this time going to make me see them in every shadowy room and corner of my eye like in my past? For the longest time I just wanted the dreams to stop and once they did I never thought twice about them again. Like they never really happened. Now it seems they are coming back, in force more than likely, and for some reason now in my dreams it seems I am more worried about my youngest son than myself. I really hope this isn't real and just some messed up way for my dreams to tell me about my insecurities or something. I'm worried and terrified and I don't know why. Dreams aren't supposed to be this real right?

I am sorry for such a long wall of text.

TL:DR I used to have dreams of being taken by aliens but they stopped. I literally just woke myself up screaming after having my first dream of being taken by aliens in years. And now its my son being taken I think.

Nordic alien abduction/monitoring,"I believe I was abducted by the Nordic aliens. The reason for my suspicions is a really vivid memory of a dream I had growing up (over 12 years ago) that I can still remember like it just happened. The entire dream was a tale pale woman with blonde hair wearing a see through white flowing gown. The most striking thing about her though was her eyes, The deepest blue. I also had an overwhelming since of love, arousal, and attraction towards her. Those feelings come back anytime I recall the dream. On top of the dream, I've had bad insomnia my entire life, an overwhelming fear of open doors/windows, often hearing a buzzing or ringing that nobody else can hear, I've seen a black triangular shaped ufo flying over the highway on a drive back to the naval base I was statoned at, I sleep walk (often waking up somewhere with no knowledge of how I got there), and I always feel like someone is watching me particularly at night. Anyone had similar? Particularly the dream portion?",0

My experience,"This happened to me in middle school, I think the 7th grade, so i was about 13/14
For some context I live in the suburbs in essentially a 2 floor home in the suburbs. I slept on the second floor and next to my room was my brother's and my parents. My room has a walk in closet on the far wall from the door and next to that is a window. My bed is next to the door opposite the wall with window/closet.

 I went to bed as usual around 10:30pm/11pm, when all of a sudden I woke up around 3am laying on my back with my arms and legs spread out with no blankets just my pajamas on. This very strange for me to wake up like this because I normally sleep on my stomach. Anyways, I wake up and hear this very loud humming or vibrating and find myself unable to move. I was scared shitless but I tried getting up and found myself unable move any part of my body except my neck, albeit a few inches. I pick my head up as much as possible and see this blue light shinning from, where should have been the window. Around the light I see multiple silhouetted figures and I was freaked out. These things were pointing and moving, definitely communicating. I tried yelling for help but I couldnt make noises, it was impossible to speak. Then the vibrating/humming increased in intensity until ultimately stopped and I was able to move my body. After the paralysis ended I found myself in bed, I hid under the covers and faced the wall. I heard strange noises in my room and had the sensation of being watched for what seemed like forever. I finally got enough courage and looked around my room and saw nothing, I didnt sleep the rest of the night.

This has happened two more times and hasnt happened in a few years. This could easily be sleep paralysis but im not sure. My brother also told about a dream he had when he was younger, in it he floated out the window and followed some light.",0

My Wife's Weird Abduction Dream,"My wife and I had a weird experience, something I was more curious about than her at the time. We lived in Tennessee and we were really poor, so we slept on a memory foam mat on the floor in our living room. We later upgraded to a futon, but that's not really important. I always slept on the left side, next to a coffee table we had, and one night I woke up really uneasy. I remember seeing what looked like a red laser pointer beam (that's the best I can describe it) darting side to side really fast on the side of the table, as it was very low to the ground. It is important to note I had my back turned to my wife, which was also the source of the light, and I was so tired and out of it that I really didn't think too much of it. I just remember waking up and seeing it and thinking how weird it was as I fell back asleep. A couple hours later,  I woke up laying flat on my back. I opened my eyes and just felt awake. It had to be 3 or 4 in the morning. I felt uneasy and didn't like how I just woke up suddenly feeling so alert. Then within a minute of me waking up, my wife creepily just sits straight up from being in a dead sleep. The issue I have with this is how she sat up. It was so fast, and her body didn't move naturally. I tried to recreate her movement, and I couldn't do it. She didn't bend or curl her back like a normal person would while using their abdomen to sit up. She stayed flat and just sat up all unnaturally. I immediately rubbed her back after this happened and just started saying, ""It's okay babe, you were just dreaming, you're fine."" The thing that bother's me is how I didn't feel fine when she did that, and I was almost telling myself that it was okay. I was just really uneasy that night. Here is the worst part. The next morning, I was telling my wife what happened, as she didn't remember, and she explained what she was dreaming about. She told me in her dream, she was on an 'operating table', where entities had abducted her and were getting ready to cut into her. She kept trying to tell them to stop in her dream, but they didn't care, so she sat up as hard as she could. I had no idea until the next morning that she was dreaming about that. Really freaked me out. She thought it was just coincidence, but I was uncool with the red light I saw, coupled with me waking up in such a weird way, right at the perfect time for her to sit up. Any ideas? Was I just wasting my time being concerned?",0
Beings at the window...,"Hi, 
When I was about 4 or 5 (and subsequently until I was 11), I slept in my bed which had the window above the headboard. I can't tell you how many times this experience happened, but I would wake up in the night. Immediately terrified, I would look up and in my field of vision, a tiny dot of light would fly in from the left into the sky through the window. It would stop dead and by this time I'd be freaked out.
I would freeze and that's when ""they"" would appear. Either they would be suddenly around me tickling or grabbing me or they would float outside the window. I thought they were ghosts. They were just odd, and would freak me out.
As time went on, I realised that i could run to the end of the bedroom or even downstairs before they would get me. Usually it felt like something was pulling me back into my room, and I'd claw myself down stairs hoping my folks would be sitting in the living room. Sometimes they would, other times they wouldn't. I'd be screaming at them and they would be blank, staring at a blank or fuzzy TV screen. ""They"" would float along the floor toward me. Sometimes looking like ghosts, other times I would see a devil. But ultimately... They'd get me. The next bit is odd.
I don't recall being taken out the house, but pulling was involved.
I would suddenly be in a dark corridor being taken into a large (and I mean enormous) cylindrical room. In the centre would be an illuminated podium and a larger being. I would call her the ""witch"" and she would look down at me. Her job was to ask me 3 questions but I never managed to answer her questions and all of a sudden, the floor beneath would drop. I would wake up with a jolt in bed.
Sounds far fetched but when my brother and dad cleared the loft, they found an old school work book from when I was 6 (1988 for context). Inside was the story, written crudely and an illustration with what is clearly a UFO and a grey. I get shivers thinking about it. 

I must know if anyone else has had a similar experience or has heard of ""the witch"" in regards to alien abduction. I was so young and I've always been convinced it was a dream but not so sure now.

(x-post from /r/UFOs) An Experience I Had 5 Years Ago,"Sometime in the middle of October 2010, I was up late playing computer games in my bedroom on the second story of my home here in Harleysville Pennsylvania. I was getting tired around 12:30am and decided to go to sleep around 1:00am. I fell asleep quite quickly in nothing but my boxers. Before I go into detail about the encounter I experienced, allow me to explain the layout of my room relative to the map I submitted.
My bedroom is on the second story on the southwest end of my home. I have 3 windows in my room on the front face of the house and have access to both the attic and the only fire escape on the building. This house used to be an old office building in which my bedroom was one of the offices used. My actual bed is located in the southwest corner next to a window and directly next to the fire escape door. This door has no handle on the outside and only a bar-release on the inside similar to what you would find on the inside of a school entrance door or office building. The door also has a 1.3x1.3 foot window in the top center. The actual fire escape on the outside of the door is nothing more than a metal platform and railing leading down the side of my house with metal stairs. I often use this to have a cigarette when I am at home since smoking inside the house is forbidden by the landlord. This goes to say I am quite familiar with what the scenery on the outside of my home looks like in this location.
I awoke on this day around 3am based on the dark of night outside, however, when I awoke I was already outside on my fire escape platform. I had not been dreaming as far as I could tell since everything was as it was when I am awake, and have had many vivid almost lucid dreams in the past, and I can tell you this was not that sensation. I was very groggy and confused as to how I had walked in my sleep. I have not sleepwalked since I was about 8 years old, and at this time I was 19 almost 20. I almost immediately noticed something very very large above me after this initial confusion, and took quick notice to my door being closed behind me leaving no way of re-entering my home.
As soon as I noticed this however, I felt the urge to look at this large object hovering above me. As I looked up I noticed it was sort of rounded in shape but had many many lights on the underside of it. It was directly above me so I had no view of the sides of the object. The lights were a very very bright white. Nothing like any fluorescent bulb I have ever seen. These lights were flashing without any pattern it seemed and were located all over the underside of the object in rectangular and very long trapezoidal shapes. The object had to have been at least 250 feet in diameter, possibly larger.
The underside of the object also had many things jutting out from it with these lights on it as well, but I took a firm notice to one in particular. There was this large piece with the lights on the side of it coming out from the right of the object. It's shape was like an upside down cone with the end cut off. It resembled an air filter for a high performance engine in a car. It had symmetrical lights all around its sides that were identical to the ones on the underside of the object, however the bottom of this piece jutting out was a very very dark gray-black color.
When I had first looked up, the lights were so blinding that I had to shield my eyes with one hand to see they were flashing and their shapes and locations. I observed all of this within less than 90 seconds before I became very disoriented. I forgot what I was doing, where I was at, and who I was. Almost as if these lights were inducing an acute case of amnesia. The last thing I can remember before passing out was the strange sensation of floating. I had never experienced this before, but it was as if I were suddenly weightless. My feet were no longer touching the cold metal platform and I was no longer shielding my eyes. As soon as I was blinded by the lights that were flashing I seemed to lose consciousness, unless the lights caused me to forget everything leaving me no memory of anything afterwards.
Throughout these short minutes the object made absolutely no sound. It was as if it was making everything around it completely quiet. If you have ever heard the saying ""Silence is Deafening,"" I would have to agree, there were no sounds made after I noticed the object above me. This was extremely strange since my home is on a main road, and relatively close to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Hearing not even the sound of a cricket chirp or the hum of the highway was definitely weird. I also remember the silence being almost suffocating. It felt very heavy, as if it were making the air thick like soup.
In my short, and very close observation, I remember the object being about 20 to 40 feet above me and the space in between my house and the neighbors house, and the tree in between the front of our homes was blocking out a portion of this large object. There was no wind, as if Time had stopped in its tracks. This is all simply speculation, but it was what it seemed to me.
After I lost consciousness, it got extremely bizarre. I remember waking up without any senses except for my sight and sense of balance. I was laying down with my eyes looking upwards towards what seemed to be a ceiling. My eyes were not working correctly though. It was as if I had been administered eye drops that you would get at the doctors to dilate your pupils. Everything was very blurry and distorted. I remember very little, but I do remember everything was a green/brown/gray color around me. I also remember seeing strange objects above me that appeared to be tools or examination equipment above me, none of which seemed to be created by humans. It was very very blurry though so it was hard to tell if that was exactly what it was.
I then remember a figure move into view above me. I was unable to move at all, and my vision was very poor so I could discern nothing about this being other than it seemed a little taller than I am and it had appendages like a human being (arms, torso, head, legs, etc.). It did not speak to me, however, I seemed to hear a voice in my head. It was much less a voice than it was a feeling or emotion being conveyed. The very last thing I can remember was feeling very calm, as if this being was trying to help me in some sort of way. The ""trying to help you"" feeling I received was much less about me in particular, but more of a ""you"" as in ""your race."" I then saw one of the objects above me move slightly, and I lost consciousness again.
When I came to I was sitting on the edge of my bed. My bed was made very neatly as if I had never layed down at all that night. When i looked at my alarm clock, the time was about 4:45am. I tried to remember how I got there, but nothing came to mind. I tried to sleep, but my thoughts were buzzing faster than I could even keep up with. I could not sleep no matter how hard I tried that night. The only thing I kept asking myself was ""Why wasn't I scared or afraid throughout this entire experience?""",0
Recent possible of abduction of someone i don't know,"TITLE EDIT:: Recent POSSIBILITY of abduction of someone i don't know (sorry for typo)

This is somewhat of a lackluster story, but my girlfriend and I were still scared. 

The other day at around 12:15 at night my girlfriend and I were going to go view the meteorite shower that was happening at the time. It was said to be at its peak around 1:00 am. So, we backed up some blankets and stuff and headed to a little clearing we know nearby, its not wilderness but it is secluded enough that light pollution is minimal. There is a road that runs parallel to it about 20 feet, but there are bushes and such so you can't actually see the road, but you can hear cars go by and can get back to the road in about 1 minute. Anyway we head out around 12:15 as I said as we wanted to get there early and set up blankets and whatnot. This is where stuff starts to happen. When we get into the field, before we have time to put blankets down and what not, we here a car. The car first just sounds like its driving, then tire screeching and skidding noises, then a crash. It wasn't a huge crash, but definitely loud enough. We look at each other for one second and are like ""We should make sure everyone is alright."" So we head out back to the road. It takes, as I said, no more than a minute to get back to the road. When we got there, pretty quickly, we see... nothing. No car, no people, no signs of damage to vegetation, not even tires marks from the skidding we heard. We thought it may have been further down the road so we walked about 30 seconds in the direction the car was going (could tell by sound car made before skid). We still see nothing. There are no street lights on this stretch of the road for about 300ft, so we could see light down the road but still needed a flashlight for seeing around us. When we were walking I swear I saw a figure, just a shadow of what looked like a man, cross from the middle of the street to the side of the road we were walking on. But as we came closer we saw again... nothing. No man, no trace. As we could see no signs of crash further down in the light added on the fact that a car passed by driving in that direction we decided to head back as if there was anything that car would deal with it. We went back to the field where we then noticed that the time was 12:49, MUCH longer than we thought had passed. It was not the walking and searching that took that long for sure as I said it is close by. It could have the drive here but that doesn't take more than 5 to 10 minutes and that's during the day with traffic. So that was weird too. The meteorite shower was cool, saw a good number of cool meteorites burning up in the atmosphere. After some about of time, around 1:15 ish, we hear a low breathing sound. Sounded a little like a boar, but they're are none around. We shine our lights around adn we see glowing eyes of some animal looking back at us, which then proceeds ti run away and a sort of hopping/ jumping fashion. A bob up and down of the reflective eyes. I figure it was just a dear as they are EVERYWHERE here and that the eyes were about deer eye level and that sound could have been that sound easily. Anyway we were scared mainly from the crash, my girlfriend really wanted to leave so we packed up and headed back to our car and got out in a hurry, but not a panic. So that's the story. Again not too fancy, but definitely spooky. We both believe in alien life, though I am very, very skeptical that they have visited earth. She wants more than anything to be abducted by friendly aliens and just chill. What was weird about the crash to me were a few things. 1) That we heard the crash both, but saw no wreckage or trace of anything out of the ordinary. 2) That the guy didn't check to see the damage that we clearly heard in the crash. We never heard a guy go out of his car or anything. 3) We never heard him drive off, we heard the crash and then it was silence till the second car. and then more silence. 4) The amount of time that passed was way more than I thought reasonable. So you decide what happened. I can't say with any certainty, but it is possible that he was abducted. ",0
Allagash Abduction - Speculation?,"Just wondering what people think about the Allagash abductions on the 20th August, 1976. 

I have no doubts that aliens exist, I feel they do. Thanks to advances in science and technology, it's kind of obvious we are being watched, and NOT by a God. I also feel this abduction is extremely convincing. ",0
My mothers experiences...,"Okay so this first one is when she lived in Plainfield ,IN . She was also pregnant with me at the time.

  So one night she just wakes up to the sound of feet running around the house . she found it to be weird and her first thought was that it was my half brother and sister fooling around . Seeing as they would have them over a lot to visit. When she was finally awake enough to gather her thoughts she realized my half brother and sister was at their mothers. She got up to see what the hell was going on fearing the worst. She walks to the door and reaches for the knob of the door. All of the sudden A voice tells her if she opened the door we will scare you. Terrified she ran back in bed and throws the covers over her head and closes her eyes trying so hard to go back to sleep. When she sees this reddish orange light start from her feet and slowly goes up to her head . When it reaches her head she blacks out . 

The next one is in the same house I had my experience in. 
All she can remember of this one is her being in bed when this flash of light comes from outside it is so bright is lights the whole room . When suddenly she is lifted out of bed and being pulled out the window she is desperately reaching and yelling to my dad to help her . He is fast asleep and doesn't wake up. She goes black after that.  There was a time when we lived with my grandparents, because our home in Plainfield was going to be knocked down to put an air stripe in its place. my mom was up late these one night she decided to take a look outside the window in the living room . my grandparents windows were all really big . She was just looking outside when she saw this red light start to descend a few house down . She freaked out and went right to bed . She has also seen light circle airplanes when she lived in Plainfield. she would always have trouble sleeping in the Plainfield house. So she would stand at the window and look outside a lot . She has seen a lot of UFOs.    ",0
My experience...,"So first off I have to say as a child I feared aliens . I would have nightmares almost every night and some dreams of seeing UFOs coming down from the sky to the back yard. Some dreams were of me playing with tall white beings. So not all were nightmarish.   I could not sleep unless a was rolled up like a burrito in my blankets facing away from the window. I also as a kid would get whatever library books I could find about aliens and UFOs at the school library. My mom also had experiences while she was pregnant with me. She leaved in Plainfield ,IN pretty close to the air port at that time.   

In this experience I was at least 5, or 6. I remember waking up in the middle of the night. I slept on a bunk bed and always slept on the top bunk. I was thirsty like immediately. So I decided to go get a drink. So I started to climb down the steps to the bunk bed. Then I got really scared. So like any other kid would do I yelled for my mom. Who would fall asleep in the living room most nights. The house is pretty small. So my room is like right next to the living room. ""Mom ! I'm thirsty can you get me some water!"" ""Mom!"" is what i said. I got no answers back. So I was to scared to go out and get it myself. So I turned around and started to climb back up to the top bunk to just go back to sleep. I put one foot on the first step and for some unexplained reason I turn my head to the window. I just looked at it with a werided out look on my face . I then walked to the window. my dresser is in front of the window so I had to lean over it to look through the blinds. When I did there is my neighbors house right next door their drive way is separated from our house by a small stripe of grassy area that is ours . There were two beings one very tall and white and one very small and a little darker in color.They were standing right next to each other between the neighbors drive way and the stripe of grass next to my house.  I remember not being afraid at all at the sight of the tall being but I didn't want anything to do with the smaller one nor did I want to even look at it.  After seeing them outside my window . I awoke and it was morning. I remember being really confused as to how I got back in bed . I never told anyone about this tell I was older I told my mom.  then she told me about her experiences. which sounded scarier than mine does. I just know what happened was no dream . I had no other experiences that I remember or stuck out to me .   ",0
My Experiences,"It first began when I was 7 years old. One summer night I was trying to sleep and I thought we were having an earthquake. I sensed a presence outside my window and a strong shaking/rolling sensation as if we were having an earthquake. It seemed like it lasted for a minute or so. The next thing I know it is morning and I am lying in bed. First thing I asked my parents in the morning is if they felt the earthquake last night. They said no and I thought that was odd. I went for a swim in our pool and experienced some pain in my genitals. I'm not going to go into all the details but I had small incisions and white things under my skin which I was able to remove. It was painful especially in the shower and the pool. Then I thought maybe this is what a wet dream was. So I told my friends on the way to school that I had a wet dream. When I explained the details they said that isn't a wet dream. I then replied I must have been abducted by aliens.

Years went by and I always remembered that experience and wondered about it. Since then every so often (at least 10 times) I have woken with strange unexplainable cuts on my skin. They are straight lines 2-5 inches long. Red and lightly scabbed, but they heal quickly. And they occur in places some of which I can't even reach like on my back. Once I woke up covered with 30+ scratches. My girlfriend at the time noticed them and asked about them. I did not have an explanation. She was sleeping in the same bed with me the night that happened. I've woken with these scratches off and on over the years sometimes it seems like years go by and then just when I think things are normal again I'll wake up with a new set of scratches.

I am currently married. A couple of months ago my wife and I were sleeping. My wife woke me up in the early morning and was disoriented. She said she went to bed with clothes on but now she was naked and could not find her clothes. She also said she heard weird noises outside our window and had strange dreams. I woke up with weird scratches on my skin that morning as well. I have never shared with her my experiences or beliefs and do not plan to.
I have no memories of ever seeing an alien. But logically that is the best theory I can come up with. I have not undergone hypnosis to try to recover memories and don't really want to. I would rather this never happened to me and is somewhat scary to think about.

Overall my health seems fine and if they wanted to harm me they easily could but seem not to. I have no real interest in going to ufo conventions etc. They seem mostly full of crackpots and also once you associate with that group it has a negative stigma and people think you are crazy. Most of the information I have found online has been interesting but I am skeptical as there are alot of weirdos out there so I take everything with a grain of salt.

I hope that one day this will all make sense. I am now in my 30s. Anyways just thought I would share. I am currently running a camera in our bedroom when we sleep. Not expecting it to work if this ever happens again but figured it can't hurt.",0
I Was Five," My first memories began in this house. Central Texas 1969, my dad raised cutting horses for a living. A cowboy from heart, always and still is though today he's 74 and my mother, his wife of 58 years, passed away last December.

 My brother got his first drum set, he was fascinated with rock and roll and wanted to be a rock star, of course. We had a tire swing that hung from the oak tree in the front yard, too close to a cactus patch it would turn out. My dad had built a mechanical bull. primitive today but effective for the time period. It's was a 55 gallon barrel suspended by 4 large springs from a frame he had built. We was a welder.
 My dad tied steel for a living before I was born. Dams along the Colorado and Rio Grande rivers. He had finished the Two Rivers Dam located Southwest Of Dulce, New Mexico, saving his money to buy a ranch. I would be conceived here on Valentines day of 1964.  

 I was born that same year in San Angelo Texas, my dad would later move us to Rising Star Texas. A town very close to ^[Stephenville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephenville,_Texas). I had a purple tricycle and my mom was an Elvis fan and a James Bond fanatic.

 Mom had gone grocery shopping that day and had bought me a new toy. A James Bond Spy Kit. The box was as big as I could hold and I was in awe of all the goodies inside. I also discovered that day that a young colt, born of my dads albino mare, would play with me just like a dog but that's a different story as well.

 My parents were Southwest Baptist and we seldom had company that wasn't business related. This night they were having a party.  A hallway lead from the living room to the bedrooms and bath. Mom and dads was the master bedroom at the end of the hall with it's own bath. Mom wanted to put me in their bed so I would be farther away from the noise and be able to fall asleep. They were stringent about bed times. Being five I had conquered the art of pretending to fall asleep. Tonight was my to be my forte. ""They were having a party!"" I wanted to see what the grown ups did for fun. 

 When mom placed me in their bed the first thing I noticed was the bed was enormous, it was a queen and I slept in a twin. It was the size of a pasture. 
Mom kissed me and tucked me in then left right away. I didn't even have time to pretend to fall asleep for her to leave. Now I had to guess how long I needed to wait for them to forget about me and sneak my way down the hall to get a glimpse of all the action.
 She came right back, 'Crap.'

 That wasn't her? It was somebody else and it was wearing a hoodie? I actually wouldn't know what a hoodie was for a couple more years but anyway. When the figure stepped through the threshold of the door they raised their left hand. It wasn't a hoodie, it was the grim reaper. Large head and long thin fingers.
 I pulled the tucked in sheet as hard as I could over my head. The fear was the most intense I've ever felt in my life. I know what I saw and i would be 15 before i convinced myself it was a dream. I know it wasn't. I know what it was and I've always known.

 I had a close to photographic recall growing up. By mid grade school I was well aware that my parents and teachers stopped learning the day they left the last school they had attended. I had PBS. That was enough with my memory. I would scan through the book for each class on the first day of school and never touch it again. Now I had to wait for a school year to pass for them to question me on it whenever it was seldom my turn. I could have answered all the questions on the first day and got on with it, again that is another story. 
 When I was about nine (1973) my dad was going to sell the ranch and begin a career of harvesting. He was meeting his new partner in this new venture whom had a son 1 year older than me. We'd been friends for that whole day and where playing outside as it began to get dark. 

 While playing chase with Brad, he treed me. My only escape was to climb the nearest tree, a cherry I believe. I was climbing a cherry tree, Brad virtually on my heels when I stopped. A red orb was floating in the sky. It was as big as a house and was playing like a firefly in the sky. 
 Shortly we began to believe it was playing with us, it seemed to go where we wanted. Then suddenly it shot away towards the eastern horizon then back again. It left towards the North accelerating at a 45 degree angle at over 10,000 miles an hour or more. 

 That""s when a giant Roman candle appeared in the sky to our right, south. A white ball of light bleeding red, blue and green, Then another being just above it we could see the tiny parachute that held the first one. Then another to the North and then we could see the silhouette of a military bomber. A four engine prop plane. Then we both realized the last flare had gone off directly over my parents ranch.

 We turned and bolted towards the house only to meet our dads coming out the front door. They didn't have time to talk to us because my dads horses had jumped then fence and were in the highway.
 That night we sat in his room and listened to Fleetwood Macs Rumors and Queens A Day At The Races. We would be best friends for the next decade. I've never seen Brad since we graduated.

15 years old. Two friends approached me and said they'd heard of a beer store that sold to anyone. The old man that owned it was blind as fuck. They had money, I'd had a license at 14. Grandma was scared to drive, i could take her car anytime i wanted. First beer run of my life, 20 miles of dirt road. 

 The way back I'm doing 70 down hill on a dirt road when an owl with a wing span wider than the windshield passes over the top of us by about a foot. Lands 50 yards in front of us in the middle of the road. Slam on the breaks, WTF! Come to a stop and get out. Look at this fucker, WTF! He's sitting directly in front of the road we need to take to the left. I don't believe this shit! A four foot tall owl landed in the middle of the road and stopped us. He turns his head 180 degrees and looks at us. Turns his head back and flies away. WTF! This is my first beer run, really? 

 I am RH- and my scoop mark is below my left thumb on the top of my hand. I know what I saw. Here is a ^[map](http://i.imgur.com/28iH8Nx.png) of my birth and childhood.
I'm looking for anyone with a similar experience, 

**TL;DR** Abducted at five by a 5ft tall insect. Grew up with a photographic memory, watched orbs chased by the military and a 4ft tall owl stopped me on my first beer run at 15..

Aboard the ship.,"I had an abduction experience,It started with me waking up in a dimly lit rusty metallic room unable to move,and in the room there were many slim metal cages like chicken traps the size of a shoe box with people inside except in retrospect they were more like boneless skin suites,then i was carried and pulled with my feet dragging along a dimly lit corridor passing by stange humanoids but far from human ,creature with arms,legs,head but still strange in appearance unable to move my head but free to move my eyes I saw silhouettes  of strangely shaped bodies short fat bodies and others with tall skinny limbs  .I was finally sitting and laying against who ever was dragging me along.I was laying against him in a way that appeared as if we were both going down a water slide together.Now while i was sitting unable to move i had decided to stop panicking because I was unable to yell and I figured if he wanted to kill me he would have and with that realization came a calm sense of security .I remember the words HE said while doing something to the top of my head like some sort of surgeon ,he said ""aren't you afraid to end up alone?.""After he got up i saw he was wearing a dusty suite white in color and his hair was neon green with out illuminating .Then I suddenly start  falling asleep And wake up In my high school class from 7 years ago with a mouth full of sharp shark like teeth freaking me the hell out causing me to faint/black out and wake up in my bed.",0
Identifying SP,"I’m making this because 75% of this sub is people asking “was this SP”. And almost always the answer is yes. So I’m going to list the various effects and some helpful information about the effects. Sort of a master guide to “Do I have SP”


Edit: This is a list of potential Symptoms, if you only experience 2 or experience all you are most likely experiencing SP
Seeing and hearing things are far more rare than not. However its also boring hence why no one shares their story here or other places when not a lot happened. 


Edit: 0. Someone pointed out I didn’t include the obvious, Paralysis, feeling of being unable to move, like your limbs weigh a million pounds, like your being held down, like your moving but nothing is happening, pain in limbs you try to move. ETC... (This is where we get the name, the explanation is simple. Your whole body is asleep, except for your brain.) 


1. Chest pressure/ Feeling of being unable to breathe.
(While under the effects of an SP episode the nerves in your chest are dulled as they are under the impression you’re asleep. You are in fact still breathing.)

2. Hallucinations
(You’re brain is in dream mode, you’re having open eyed dreams)

3. Sounds (screaming, talking, music etc...)
(Again this is because of your dreams being active while awake)

4. Feelings of being touched, hurt, bit, scratched, flying, falling, shaking
(You’re nerves are all asleep, sometimes they’re in the process of waking up and can cause interesting feelings as they do. Alternatively you’re body may be simulating what your brain is dreaming about as we normally experience these while asleep)

5. Panic, anxiety, terror
(100% natural responses to being trapped.)

6. Feeling like time won’t pass or time is stuck
(You have no real way of perceiving time in this state)

7. Racing heart
(Anxiety)

8. Intense or vivid nightmares/dreams before or after
(The nightmare would be what woke you up into the SP, and if it comes after it’s because you’re anxiety is through the roof)

9. Feeling alone
(SP is not as rare as you think, lots of people never even know it happened as they attribute it to a weird dream, you’re not alone, there’s lots of us out here.)

Edit: 10. Recently discovered through this Sub, I had never heard of or experienced it but people report “Buzzing” “Humming” “Grinding” type noises preceding and episode.


Edit: 11. Also recently Discovered through the sub, spiraling, dizzy, sickly feelings. Occurring before during or after episodes.


Edit: 12. In the comments someone mentioned “feeling a presence.” To be clear, this is almost as Rare as actually seeing something. It does happen however and can be an eerie feeling. (Again your having an anxiety attack, our brains try to explain why we are panicking by blaming something. So it manifest a feeling of someone being out to get you, someone there to harm you, or maybe just someone in the room. Either or, nothing to be too scared of.)


There’s a slough of other things that can happen. But generally you can identify SP with three questions.
“Am I in my bed”
“Am I paralyzed”
“Am I unable to talk”

If the answer to these questions are yes then it’s textbook SP

Also remember that people are wildly different, and that your SP may be different but follow the same patterns as what you read. That’s normal, we all have differently wired brains, and no two cases will be exactly alike.


Sources: Myself, experienced SP for the past 16 years.

If anyone needs any advice or has any questions feel free to comment here and I’ll try my best to answer. SP doesn’t have to be as scary as it feel.",1
is it normal to experience sleep paralysis multiple times a night?,"for background, ive missed a couple doses of my effexor and vyvanse which i’m going to assume is what caused this, along with the fact that i wasn’t gonna sleep well tonight anyway because i took a really long nap earlier in the day and the brain zaps from missing effexor are lowkey killing me.

i keep falling asleep, waking into sleep paralysis, snapping out of it, attempting to fall back asleep, and the cycle continues. every single time it terrifies me because before tonight i’ve never experienced ANYTHING like this. i’m pretty sure it’s SP i’m experiencing even though i’m not really seeing a “demon” like people are saying, i’m just feeling a bad presence in the room with me. the worst part is that i’m waking up into SP from nightmares that i’m having trouble distinguishing from reality. after about the fifth time i snapped out of SP i finally was able to get out of bed and here i am now. 

i desperately want to go back to sleep, but i’m terrified that the cycle i’ve been experiencing tonight will continue. is what i’m experiencing normal? can anyone please lend some helpful words? i’m having a really rough night",1
oh no,isn’t water just a snowman’s blood?? 🤯🤯🤔🤔,1
"Something that works for me with preventing SP, especially when you keep getting SP when trying to sleep","Not sure it will work for other people but it works 100% of the time for me. 

When you feel SP coming, try your best to break out of it, then get up, go to your kitchen, and drink a glass of water. When you get back to bed, it wont happen again.
I tried just walking around when i break out of an episode but when i go back to bed to try and go to sleep again,i get another round of SP. It only stops when i drink water for some reason",1
The moment I fall asleep I wake up in a panic feeling like I can't breathe/ takes hours to fall asleep,"This has only been happening for a few months. It started off where I would try to take naps during the day. It's like as soon as my body would fall asleep I would wake up in this panic and then be unable to fall asleep again. Therefore, unable to nap.
Now it has moved into nighttime sleep. As soon as I get comfortable and my body starts to fall asleep, all of a sudden I wake up feeling like my throat is closed unable to breathe for a few seconds, and with this panicky feeling. Sometimes it is just the breathing part, and sometimes it’s just the panicking part. Sometimes it's both. This happens several times over the course of a couple hours every night. 
It never happens after I've already been sleeping...its ALWAYS the moment I start to fall asleep. 
I have experienced actual sleep paralysis only as many times as I can count on one hand in my life. Terrifying. This… I’m not so sure of what it is. 
Sometimes, although rarely, I still get this weird feeling as soon as I’m falling asleep where I hear the most obnoxious loud sound in my ear. It’s like the loudest alarm clock ever, or somebody screaming bloody murder, or like a tea kettle whistling… and then I wake up and obviously there’s no sound. But that is very rare.
I had a baby 18 months ago and I thought the whole waking up while trying to nap panic feeling was just new mom anxiety… But it’s only getting worse and it has nothing to do with my feelings towards sleeping while my daughter is in bed. And now it has moved into my nighttime sleep. Every night.
Does anybody know what this is? I’m not depressed, I have very mild anxiety that I do not treat with medication, the only thing I can think of recently is that I’ve been getting really bad headaches from occipital neuralgia… They did put me on gabapentin but I’m only on 100 mg a day and I’ve only been on it for a week. Other than that, I have no idea what’s happening and I’m absolutely exhausted and really need help.",1
NSFW: My sleep paralysis experiences with rape and disturbing hallucinations. I’m experiencing this almost every night.,"Hi guys, I just found this sub and I’m honestly really relieved that other people out there are experiencing the same thing as me. I was starting to feel crazy. I’m a 22F, and I’ve been experiencing sleep paralysis more and more frequently, to where I’m experiencing it almost every night. Here are my experiences. 

1) I first had sleep paralysis when I was 16. I woke up in my bed and couldn’t move, which seemed to go on for several minutes and was very distressing, but I was eventually able to wake myself up. 

2) My next sleep paralysis experience was definitely the most bizarre and happened when I was 18. I woke up in my bed paralyzed and a 7 foot tall humanoid figure with grey tree bark skin and no face stood at the foot of my bed. It started to grope me and I felt like I was being sexually assaulted. It raped me, it felt exactly like a real sexual encounter. This is TMI but I actually had an orgasm. After googling this experience, I found the concept of succubi/incubi, and that scientists attribute these experiences to sleep paralysis. 

3) After that weird experience, I probably only had sleep paralysis a handful of times over 3 years, and I was always able to wake myself and didn’t see/hear anything distressing. But recently things have gotten really bad. 

4) For the past 3 weeks, almost every night, I have had sleep paralysis. Sometimes multiple times in the same night, where I have to wake myself up and then go back to sleep again. It has made me afraid of falling asleep. Some of my experiences are, feeling like I am being pulled from my bed, a feeling of falling, feeling a “ghost” in my bed pulling my sheets and touching me, feeling aroused by a “ghost” touching me, hearing voices speaking gibberish. 

5) Last night was the worst. I woke up in my bed, and my mom was kneeling beside my bed staring at me. I live with my mom, and sometimes she will come in my room in the morning to tell me about news or something. So I assumed it must be morning, and my mom had come to tell me something. But then my “mom” starting speaking gibberish and in my other ear I started hearing a really deep man’s voice also saying nonsense words. I realized this was sleep paralysis, and willed myself to make my fingers move and wake myself up, all the while hearing these scary voices. It was just awful. 

I’m scared to go to sleep now. I don’t what to do. Part of me wants to be like, is there a way I can reframe the experience to make it seem interesting instead of scary? But it’s really difficult because every experience feels evil. I don’t know why all of a sudden this has been happening so frequently. 

For context, my dad and his mother both have a sleep condition called REM sleep behavior disorder where they aren’t paralyzed during REM sleep and act out their dreams by yelling, talking, kicking, punching etc. When I was a little kid I would kick in my sleep too and I needed a side railing so I wouldn’t fall out of bed, but I grew out of that. I’m just mentioning because I don’t know if this family history could be related, since I know sleep paralysis is also a disturbance in REM sleep. The only other weird sleep thing I do is that occasionally I will wake up with my head at the foot of the bed, opposite to how I fell asleep. 

Thank you for reading this far, it’s a relief to be able to talk about this. Please share if you have had similar experiences and any advice you might have.",1
My first SP experience,"It happens more than 10 yrs ago when i was in highschool.
At that time i was finally able to sleep without any lights turns on, the AC was set very low, so i cover myself entirely. I held my blanket with my two hands up until it parallel with my forehead. it didn't take me too long to dream, i guess i was too tired that day. 

i remember it was started from a very vivid and strange dream: 
i dreamt that I sleep on the upper bed of a two story bed (not a bunk-bed) when i rolled out of bed and fall onto someone that sleep on the lower bed. at that second instead of feeling something is sleeping under me, i felt something sliding onto my back through my back spine (i still on my hands up-pose) and it woke me up. i could just move my eyes, they're not cover by the blanket, looking around the dark room i tried to comprehend what was happening. i wasn't aware yet that i couldn't move my body, but i was afraid of what was that that slides onto my back, was it still there? i was scared to even checked what it was. so, i decided to just get up. and that is when i realized that i have been paralized. can't move anything not even my toes. i think i stayed like that for 5-10 minutes. i had cold sweat, my heart racing as i breath fast. i closed my eyes, like so tight. i don't know if it was to get back to sleep again or tried to wake my dreaming-self. when it didn't work, i tried to wiggle my toes (yes i already knew stories from my friend the tips but i didn't know what it was yet, not like now) and it still didn't work. finally, as my last attempt i prayed. yes. i recited every scriptures that i remember on my head.

it worked. i woke up, with sweats (remember the AC is set so cold). so, i quickly get up, turned on the light, and got out of my bedroom and found my family member that still haven't slept so that i know that i'm back to reality.",1
Sleepparalysis hallutionations talking?,"I recently had sleepparalysis again. Normally, I only feel like I'm pinned down and can't breath (normal SP stuff you know). I can 'feel' a presence in my room, holding me down, maybe moving my hair from my face or trailing its fingers down my face and sitting on my bed behind me while keeping me from moving and crushing me into my matras.
But the last time, that Thing suddenly stopped. I heard it say ""good afternoon"" and it opened the door and left. The door was still closed when I finally dared to check, but it was the first time I heard it speak. 
Has anyone else heard their SP-hallutionation speak to them?",1
My SP elevated,"So I have been dealing with sleep paralysis for years. My typical SP experience is high pitched ringing, vibrations, and maybe a dark figure occasionally. But tonight I was starting to fall asleep and my hall light began to flicker and I went into SP mode. I was fighting it and started to have more intense vibrations/ringing and felt like I was actually levitating/floating. Keep in mind the hall light is flickering in all of this and is making me panic. I felt like this lasted more than my typical SP episodes and all of the vibrations were more intense. Has anyone else ever had something similar? Kind of scared because this isn’t my typical SP.",1
falling into sp?,"once in a while instead of waking up paralyzed, I'll be attempting to fall asleep and then, still awake, I'll find myself paralyzed. is this still sleep paralysis? i still experience chest pressure and hallucinations during this, the same as when i wake up in sleep paralysis.",1
Sleep paralysis?,I was having a dream as usual and then suddenly I was awake and then not really awake? I started hallucinating and then it felt like someone was tapping on my teeth really fast and it feels like my whole body is about to shut down and I can’t move no matter how hard I try to. Then it stops and I feel completely normal? It isn’t my weirdest sleep experience but is it just a weird form of sleep paralysis?,1
First Encounter,"Hi, long time snooper but first-time poster here! Apologies if it's a little messy, I had my first SP experience two nights ago, and I haven't thought about anything since so I thought I would share.

A little background to my situation: I was pretty stressed the night before trying to complete a presentation, I had a tonne of sugar that day which then resulted in me feeling super ill and stressed out when I went to bed. My sleeping schedule is currently non-existent as my partner has been getting up for work around 5am for the past few weeks. I have occasionally been spending the night there, whilst also staying up however long I can be bothered staring at a screen doing work. After they left for work that morning, I stayed up for a while, scrolling through twitter, not really aiming to go back to sleep. Still, I seemingly drifted off on my back, which is so incredibly unusual for me.

I woke up (or so I thought) to a presence behind the bedroom door, my first instinct was that it was my partner returning from work; however, I dismissed that theory as I knew I couldn't have slept in that long. I noticed a great weight bearing down on my chest and managed to open my eyes although I couldn't move my head, so all I saw was the skin of whatever was on top of me. I then came to the conclusion that it was, in fact, my partner and they had sneaked in to try and scare me when I woke up, although they didn't talk they only groaned. I wanted to tell them ""I can't wake up"", but I could only move the tip of my tongue, this is when I realised I couldn't move the rest of my body.

My flatmate experiences SP quite regularly so I'm relatively familiar with the symptoms and was luckily able to identify what was happening. I can be quite volatile at the minute, so I was very thankful I was able to remain calm. Once I became aware that it was SP, my partner disappeared, however, I still felt the pressure on my chest and a slight sense of dread. Also, an eerie atmosphere was now present. I looked around the room, and it was a carbon copy of the room I was in beside the lighting was a little different. There was writing on the curtains, I could only make out the word ""springing"". At this point, I was able to move my head, the more I moved, the freer I became so I began to work on my right arm to reach my phone that was under my pillow. When I lifted it up in front of my face, there was a glitchy censorship over my hand, so I had nothing beyond my wrist. Adamant my phone was in my hand, I activated Siri by holding down the lock button and tried to call my partner. This was before ultimately giving up because I couldn't speak coherently. At this point, I was so very aware of what was going on and tried to fight it. I managed to lean over the side of the bed, figuring I'd deal with walking once I got to the floor. However, when I looked over, there was a door open ajar on the floor as if the rules of gravity didn't apply. I decided there was no chance was going to attempt that so I just rolled back over. I can't remember exactly if the phone or the door thing happened first, but after this point, I came to and seen my phone was actually on the floor charging.

I didn't really hear anything that I could notice, mostly just my own moaning trying to talk. Since it happened I have became hyper fixated on reading other people's experiences and learning more about it. I can't help but think if I had actually somehow managed to call my partner, very thankful I didn't work that one out!",1
Someone Help me figure out what’s going on,"For the past few years I have been experiencing sleep paralysis at least 1-3 times every week, however the last few months I have been experiencing it daily, sometimes I have it 1-3 times a night. I sleep with my dog now out of fear. Is there anything I can do to make it stop?",1
The Times I Have Experienced Sleep Paralysis So Far,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalright I have quite a few stories here so enjoy!

1.) This was a while ago, I can't remember when. My family and I were driving home from and it was around 12 am when we got back. I had been sleeping in the car in the uncomfortable way (almost everyone has most likely experienced at least once in their life) and then I was finally in my room. I went to sleep and I thought that the next time I'd  wake up was in the morning. Well I woke up maybe around 2:30ish (I didn't look at a clock until after the incident) to see one of my stuffed rabbits sitting up right. It was propped up against the blanket cuz my legs were bent. It was like I was crab crawling, but it was just my legs that were bent. I also heard intense deep whispers, felt weight (which I thought were hands) on both of my shoulders, and felt waves of a tingling sensation from my feet to my shoulders. I thought that this was my dad pranking me. I thought Ha Ha, you got me dad, and I went to tell him to let him know that he could stop........I couldn't talk. I tried and tried the tingling sensation growing when I tried to move, and it was also really weird because I felt like my mouth was wide open. This was when I realized that this wasn't a prank and I became terrified. I saw something fly up out of the corner of my right eye (like f someone shot a rubber band towards the ceiling. Eventually I regained my ability to move and went downstairs. I checked the time. 2:44 am. I did not know how long I was like that for, but at that point I just wanted to get my mind off of it.

2.) The next time it happened was when I was in the car with my family. We were heading home and I slept all throughout the trip. Then my family stopped for something that I cannot remember. I was chilling, my Rick hat semi-covering my eyes when it started. I just had the tingling sensation every time I tried to move. I could SEE my sister RIGHT NEXT TO ME. I tried to get her attention the only way I could. Breathing heavily. Didn't work. It stopped and I turned to her and said ""Yo I was just in sleep paralysis, how did you not notice?"" She just shrugged.

3.) I had a couple of occurrences while I was video chatting with my boyfriend, I can't remember how many times it's happened though. I mainly remember trying to open my eyes to see him, but I was at an angle every time where I could not see him. His voice soothed me throughout the experience and then I was able to move again. From that point on, if we we are ever on call and he hears me inhale and exhale deeply three times, he knows that I'm going through sleep paralysis and tries his best to comfort me. Some of the times I was going through it, my mouth felt like it was open, so my boyfriend and I named the demon who was holding my mouth open ""Bubbers."" Edit: I tried to move to look up and sometimes I thought I was actually moving a limb, but when I ""stopped moving,"" I realized I hadn't moved at all.

4.) So this one was a weird one. I woke up. One look around and I knew I wasn't awake because my room layout was different. Last time I checked I had a room to myself and DIDN'T have a bunk bed. So I told myself that I was gonna wake up. So I did. Not. This room looked more similar except my bed was split in half. This time I was going to wake up. I could feel my eyelids opening, I could see my room, and the other room at the same time. All while I was having that familiar tingling sensation.

5.) I'm not sure what happened in this experience(?). I saw myself out of bed, a black tall figure in one of my windows. I was trying to walk away from it, but I felt so heavy and I could feel the tingling sensation from sleep paralysis, but I.....was.....walking? Well when I got near the door I started to curl up into myself. It just didn't make sense. I don't know if I was having a nightmare or if it was actually sleep paralysis.

6.) This is the most recent one, four days ago. I fell into sleep paralysis, the tingling, and this time, I could hear my boyfriend saying something to me, but I couldn't understand what he was saying. We were not on call as the wifi cut off in my house at 1 am and it was past that. Nothing else happened and I eased out of it.........into ANOTHER ONE. This time it was much more worse for me. Tingles and this time, I opened my eyes to see (don't laugh) the familiar blocky figure of Herobrine. He was on the opposite side of the bed where I was laying.  I was do freaking horrified. Mainly because it seemed like a figure was there and was going to hurt me. I tried to close my eyes and calm myself down to ease myself out of it. My eyes opened again and to my utter horror, the figure was closer, looming from the opposite side of the bed still, but looking into his white square eyes......I so desperately wanted to scream, but of course.....I couldn't. I just closed my eyes and finally freed myself. I waited for a few minutes and the went to sleep the rest of the night.

So those are my stories so far, if I have any other experiences I'll be sure to write them down here. Also, can anyone tell me if numbers 4 and 5 were actual SP experiences?",1
SP where you can move ‘out of body’,"I’ve had this on and off for years now, but I’ve never had a situation where I’m just laying there completely paralysed unable to move. Usually I get the sense of fear and some kind of entity will enter the room, trying to grab me and turn me over and ticking me etc. (I sleep on my stomach). When this happens I usually fight it out of body, and we end up on the bedroom floor wrestling while I’m smashing it’s face in. I then wake up eventually in my normal position. 
Is this still sleep paralysis? Or just a basic nightmare?",1
I think I may have just had a sleep paralysis and it was terrifying.,It’s currently 8:57 and this took place probably about 6 minutes ago. I was having a dream and this person was surrounding me and then I felt a strong pressure of someone pulling my arm off my bed. It really felt like someone was pulling me. And then I felt something on my back. I think I may have tried to say something but I don’t know if I did or not. It was absolutely horrible. My eyes were shut and I couldn’t move. It probably lasted maybe about 10 seconds or something.,1
I had very weird sleep paralysis,"1st Time i had it, i opened my eyes and i could move but, my movements were very hard and i could see the light outside the window but no sounds. I think it was like 6 in the morning when i had it, after i moved i could hear weird growls. I closed my eyes and pretended to sleep, after that i could feel like i'm being dragged down, after it stopped i woke up. Second time happened a week ago, it was middle of the night and i could move but this time i felt like someone is watching me. I had my eyes closed and i could feel like someone is hitting me in the legs. Before that i had a very weird and realistic dream where i passed by one passage and then darkness. After i woke up paralysis began and i couldn't hear anything outside. On the end of paralysis i could feel like something is letting me away and i could now hear the outside sounds. (Sorry for bad grammar i tried to explain it best). Also after second paralysis i had my eyes closed for 3 more minutes because i didn't know did it ended or not.",1
just experienced sp for the first time,"i woke up at 06:20. it's currently 07:18.

right before, i had a dream about my classmates from vocational school leaving the classroom. i was lowkey aware of being in a dream but then i was like ""hmm. what if i forced myself to lucid dream a little."" then i got nervous because i remembered an animator on youtube who made a video on how lucid dreaming led into sleep paralysis for him, so i attempted to wake myself up immediately. ironic.

i fell asleep on my stomach and was facing a wall, but i felt like if i could move and look behind me, there might have been someone/something there. i tried moving, and when i 'moved' too much i heard an intense ripping sound (like my soul was being ripped out of my body rather than my physical body moving?). it was hard to breathe—it felt like i was breathing through a really thick face mask. at one point i thought i heard myself call out but i don't think i did.

i find it a little funny that i got out of it by thinking about my current hyperfixation.

i only knew what it was and how to leave it kind of immediately because i used to read a lot about sleep paralysis. it was scary. i hope it doesn't happen again but it probably will.",1
Defying the laws of physics - sleep paralysis?,"Happened about 8 years ago but I still remember it vividly. Never had a similar experience ever since.

For context, my bed is placed right next to a wall and I was pretty athletic and strong.

Was around 2 or 3 am at night, I had finally decided to put the phone down and shut my eyes to try and sleep.

I assumed the Dracula sleeping position because idk, it's just comfortable at times.

I try to sleep for a bit, emptying my mind but insomnia and gadget addiction is a hell of a drug. The urge to check my phone overpowers me, so I open my eyes and reach to grab my phone.

But I can't move my arms, i cant even lift them off my chest. I felt no pressure or anything of the sort, it was as if I had lost the use of my arms.

I could see perfectly fine and I remember nothing in my room was out of place, the only slightly odd thing was that the moonlight felt more bright than usual on that night.

Freaked me the fuck out so I immediately tried to sit up but again I couldn't. I retained movement and control over my legs, neck and head but I couldn't get up, it felt like my upper back was just affixed to the bed.

Growing more scared and desperate, I swiveled my lower body to face the wall and attempt to push myself off the bed by bracing my feet agaisnt the wall.

Nothing.

I felt my body digging into the bed from the force of my legs but it just would not budge. My upper torso stayed stationary.

I applied more pressure and even heavily kicked the wall but to no avail, my body was still stuck to the same spot.

It is pretty painful kicking a brick wall with your bare feet so I quickly stopped after a while and attempted to instead launch myself off the bed by lifting my legs up and smashing my heels into the mattress in hopes that the return force from the mattress springs would launch me up.

Still nothing. (FYI, that bed is super bouncy and thick)

At this point, I'm so thoroughly terrified and traumatised by this abnormality in the law of physics that my teeth legit start chattering involuntarily.

I finally stopped moving and just shut my eyes and began reciting the lord's prayer out loud while mentally praying for god to let me move again.

The whole time I'm doing this, I'm tensing my arm muscles that wont move and after reciting the prayer twice, I finally calmed down enough to relax my muscles and tested moving my fingers hands, wrists, arms and upper back.

Finally, success!

Probably cause I was mentally exhausted by the whole ordeal, I remember just turning on my side, questioning reality and then falling asleep.

I'm inclined to believe that this wasnt a dream because I remember it so well to the point that I can still remember what the thumping noise of my feet agaisnt the wall sounded like.

So, was I tripping? Had a ghost on my chest? Experiencing sleep paralysis?

Oh, and anyone ever had a similar experience?",1
Does anyone else experience this?,"  

It is currently 4:56am and I have just woken up for the third time since I “attempted” to sleep at 11ishpm. Since I shook myself awake and was hungry, I decided before I forget to finally write down something I have noticed about my dreams/nightmares.

I tend to experience not only lucid dreaming, but sleep paralysis more often than I would like. I know it has a lot to do with my awful sleep patterns and how I fall asleep sometimes, which would be sitting up while watching tv.

While I’m lucid dreaming and realizing this is all of a dream I try my best to take advantage of this, but it usually will end up turning into a paralyzing nightmare (or tries to) and what I find the most interesting is that I seem to know when it’s going to happen. It is not that I am deciding for it to happen, but just know that my wonderful or only plain normal dream is about to become terrifying. 

Two things happen.

1.) If everything is clear, like it is daytime and I can see people and things around me normally, it will all suddenly become much darker, almost like you were outside during dusk. 

2.) If I am looking at a person in my dream (which I was this time) and their face goes from normal to demonic looking.

\- Also, just an extra, but not all the time, I hear horror style organ piano music (I know this all sounds like a vintage horror film).

Once I realize all of this happens, I shake myself awake. Through the years I have really mastered escaping the grips of a sleep paralysis monster. 

QUESTION: 

Does anyone else seem to know when a good lucid dream is about to turn into a nightmare, like signs? I feel like I am pretty fortunate to have these warning signs because there have been times where my sleep paralysis was so awful that I started choking/coughing (drowning dream) on my own built up spit.

Also, why is my subconscious warning me?

Sorry if this is all over the place, but I needed to get it all out now before I forget. 

Thank you!",1
BF hearing voices,"So my boyfriend just shared with me his experience last night. Where he was trying to go to sleep but suddenly had the feeling of his whole body being electrocuted, and he couldn't move. Whilst he couldn't move, he began to hear voices, a lot of voices he described it as being at a dinner party. He says he couldn't distinguish what the voices were saying, or if the voices were male or female. He just said that there was a lot of them. So my first thought while hearing this was that maybe it was a form of sleep paralysis. But he swears that he was trying to go to sleep and couldn't. That's when it happened. and I've only heard people who've had sleep paralysis as not being able to move, but only seeing things in their room, like shadowy figures, not hearing things. Please reach out if anyone has any similar experiences or an explanation!",1
Any way to stop SP?,"I am not getting much sleep and feel terrible during the day. I’m afraid to go to sleep.

Edit: Thanks everybody for the suggestions + info. I really appreciate it and will try out some of your tips tonight.",1
SP ?,"Last night I experienced what I think may have been sleep paralysis but I am not sure.

It started by me watching the room where I slept as if it was a theater stage. I couldn’t see myself in bed as the side that was visible to me was the one my bf slept on. I then “woke up” and somehow I was above myself. I was looking at my sleeping body as if from a hovering perspective and this freaked myself out so much that I somehow landed back in my body in what I’m assuming was another false awakening. Because I thought I was awake and was scared I tried to call out my boyfriends name but no sounds came out of my mouth. It was like trying to scream under water. I then tried to shake his arm and kick his leg but it felt as if I had no strength. Again it felt like throwing punches underwater. After what felt like a couple minutes of doing this I woke up, like actually woke up this time. My boyfriend was still sound asleep so I know I hadn’t made any noises or actually moved. 

It was so weird and felt so real. Was it maybe a lucid dream or SP?",1
This wasn't Sleep Paralysis. Please tell me differently [Serious],"I fell to sleep belly down, diagonally on my bed with my cloths still on. My bedroom light and lamp were turned on too.

I was woken up. I had 2 pillows propped behind my head. The back of my head was cramped up against the headboard. My chin was touching my chest. They opened my eyes (I didn't open them). My pupils were staring directly and my chest and I couldn't move them. My body was positioned on the edge of my bed, feet touching the edge, shoulder 8 inches from the edge. They closest \*one\* was playing with my wrist, turning my hand around. He gently placed my hand on the bed and said ""We do not know what's wrong with him."" There were 2 other huddled up close behind him. They closed my eyes and backed me out.

I think I was put into this \*exact position\* so I wouldn't see their heads. They were not human, but their intention was not to scare me. I didn't feel fear or scared at all. They had bare arms, orange skin, no finger nails, no hand veins, no hand bone lines, no hair on their skin. Their arms were close to 1 thickness from wrist to bicep. No skin pigment changes anywhere.

I could see my full bedroom perfectly. The collar of the shirt I fell to sleep in. My gray hoodie. The sheet pulled down to my stomach. My feet point up under my blanket. I could see my bedside table perfectly in my peripheral, the objects on it. I could see my closet door opened, how I left it, and all the shirts in my closet. The memory is a perfect waking vision of my room and the things in it.

After being blacked-out again, i had a slight dream and woke up. I thought ""my wrist doesn't bend like that"" and then, it turns out it does - I can point my finger tips well past my shoulder with the palm of my hand facing down. When I woke up my pillows were normal, and I was sleeping on my side normally. I put myself in the exact same position as that waking memory. Chin down, pupils pointing at my chest, and tried to open my eyes - I couldn't see past my top eyelids - perfectly matching up with my waking memory too.

Please tell me this was \*Sleep Paralysis\*. I really, really, really don't want to be a crazy person.

.

TL;DR - Got put in a weird position, woken up by caring, benevolent space doctors. I didn't feel fear in the moment. I just thought ""well this is fucking weird"" before being put under again.",1
False awakenings accompanied by sleep paralysis symptoms,"Something very strange has been happening to me. First of all, I shouldn't be able to have dreams while taking naps (they range from 10 to 30 minutes max), but I do. I always had dreams during the day, in short periods of time, which isn't normal, according to what I've read about sleep. This is a symptom of narcolepsy, but I don't have any other symptoms other than this one, therefore I don't believe I'm a narcoleptic. Can this be explained in any other way? 

In any case... Twice this week I've had a sequence of lucid dreams, in which I ""fall asleep"" and ""wake up"" multiple times, in different layers of the dream. At times I believe that I am in real life, but the hallucinations and restrictions of movement and speech that are characteristic symptoms of sleep paralysis convince me that I'm dreaming. I always ""wake up"" in my bed. I am unable to move or scream. I know that I'm dreaming, and I consciously try to wake up, avoid scary hallucinations by focusing on random ones, or fall asleep again. This never happens at night, and I'm able to sleep properly. 

I've never tried to have lucid dreams before, and I don't have much control over them, although I can control my actions.

Some of the things I've seen are: My mother, in a vampire-like form, a small possum trapped below my arm, and a projection of a couple in cartoonish monkey outfits, kissing. I've also heard something breathing through the wall. That was particularly scary. I always calm down when I realise that it's not real, though.

What do you guys think? Should I be worried? I don't think it's a real sleep paralysis, but I've had those before and I can tell it's very similar. Even the heaviness and the silent despair... I hope this isn't too off topic.",1
What do you feel/experience before SP?,"I can always tell when it's going to happen. I get this weird feeling in my brain, sort of like an electric feeling, like getting small electric shocks and feeling really dizzy. After that, my limbs start to feel very heavy, and at this point, I usually try to move a lot so it wouldn't happen. I get SPs when trying to fall asleep.

I get them very often, pretty much every night. It's a wonder if it doesn't happen. Have you noticed any ways to prevent it from happening? I'm starting to feel very frustrated after experiencing them for years. Even though they're a part of my everyday life, I still get very anxious and scared every time it happens and I often have trouble falling asleep.",1
Paralyzed speaking.,"Every time I experience sleep paralysis I am able to kind of yell in a very weird paralyzed voice to my husband to wake me up.  Usually I try saying his name or saying help.  I am always terrified and know it’s coming on and try to beg for help.  Someone recently told me I was astral projecting,  but I’m not sure?  It’s usually right when I fall asleep,  I can see the entire room around me,  I cannot move or speak but I’m always feeling completely fearful.  I’m usually so very comfortable in bed.  I don’t get it?  Happens often.  Any thoughts?",1
Worst SP Experience To Date,"Couple of things to note before I begin is that I have had SP experiences since I was a kid and continue to get it avg 2 times a month, also I can safely say I have experienced most scary things that happen during SP which leads me to this morning or about 30 mins ago... 


This morning I had a good 5 hours sleep before waking up at round 5:30 am, I stayed on my phone watching some YouTube with my AirPods in. Then around 7 I realised I would like to get some more sleep before I have to get out of bed, so I put on my sleep mask and a comedy special to fall back asleep with my head facing the ceiling.

As soon as I fall asleep I am put into and extreme amount of pressure (more than I have experienced before) during SP and I am having difficulty breathing during this I was wheezing really bad and thought I was gonna die due to lack of oxygen, I believe I almost ran out of breath which woke me up. 

Not too long after that I couldn’t help it but fell back asleep this time Instantly upon SP i feel a sharp pain near my hip which lasts the whole experience, I feel immense pressure and wheezing can’t breathe. Even though I had my sleep mask on i swear I could see a picture of my family on the roof bc I have always thought you see your family before you pass away. Not being able to comfortably breathe I could feel my body leaning back and all I could think of was “am I going to die”, “is this what happens before you die”, “I’m not ready to die yet I’m too young”. 

I truly believe that what started out as a fun experience during sleep paralysis is starting to take a nasty more serious turn and I can’t help myself from thinking is this the way I’m going to die.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far :)",1
I Think I Experienced Sleep Paralysis This Morning (?),"Hi... I don't post to reddit very often, but something happened this morning and it's got me all dazed, so was hoping to find out if I really did experience sleep paralysis or just a weird nightmare.

I went to bed around 11:30pm, but woke up at 4:15am. I went back to bed but awake again at 6:30am since I take a family member to work. I got back home around 7:30am and was exhausted (I'd gone to the gym yesterday and put it down to that) so I went back to bed to get an extra 40-50 minutes rest before I had to get ready for work.

I went to sleep totally fine, and my alarms started to go off at 8:10am as planned. It's Alexa so I was able to turn her off with my voice, and I opened my eyes to look at the clock. I decided for an extra 5 minutes (typically) but then I seemingly opened my eyes again and the clock read 15:23 and the display seemed broken. I got up from bed in a panic screaming about how I'm late for work and someone's gonna yell at me, but I needed to feed my fish. I got half dressed and opened the tank lid, but there was a huuuuuge eel like fish in the tank with my tiny fishies. It obviously didn't fit in the tank and was squirming. But I wasn't phased for some reason? I then went to open another tank lid, and that's when it hit me - I was still asleep. I only have one tank in my room so I looked at the clock and it read 8:25am.

My brain was like ""oh we should get up! It's time to get dressed!"" and the visions stopped and I saw myself in my bed. But I couldn't move and about 10 seconds later I was back at the fish tanks. There were now 3 tanks, and these monster fish were jumping out since the tanks were faaaar too small for them and I kept catching them and putting them back in. I was speaking to them, telling them ""get back in there now, it'll be fine, I know it's too small, who put you in these tanks?"" (I have no idea if I said these things out loud).

I heard so much background noise -  some sort of radio, someone playing Mario Kart but it was a little distorted, people yelling outside, my phone going off. I just focused on the fish really...

They were splashing and pushing water everywhere and trying to bite me, but I didn't get wet or hurt. I saw this smaller fish and it... floated. It was floating around the outside of the tank, so I grabbed it by the tail fin and turned it to face me. I said ""oh are you a piranha? I best not put you with the other fish, you can stay with me."" And it opened it's mouth - thin and very sharp teeth pulsated in and out of it's gums and it had dead eyes.

That scared me enough to come back out of the vision, and look at the clock. It said 8:40am and I'd had enough, and somehow was able to relax and pull myself together and get out of bed. 

I made it to work 15 minutes late, but honestly all I remember this morning is driving my family member to work and then that strange living nightmare.

This sometimes happens at least 3 times a week, where I'll have a surreal and strange dream so vivid that I'll think I'm already awake. And then when I actually do wake up, I'm dazed and confused for a good few hours. 

I originally put it down to only my antidepressants, but I don't know if it's something more?

Do tell me if this post isn't suitable for this subreddit. It feels good to get it out into words though, so thanks for listening if you did read it...


TL;DR - Went to have a 40 minute nap, ended up having a frightening nightmare about demonic fish that I was aware was of but couldn't wake up or move unless in the dream. Lasted about 20 minutes.",1
This just happened and I haven't had SP happen this way.,I do believe this was sleep paralysis because it was in a waking up stage but it was still in a dream if that makes sense. But anyway I was in my room but not in my bed I was talking to this dude about my computer and he got really close and asked me a question and was putting pressure on a point on my waist that basically paralyzed me it sent a really weird spiraling almost tingling sensation through my body and I woke up and was slowly able to move. I then fell back asleep and it happened immediately again just not in the same way.,1
Any horror movies based on sleep paralysis?,0,1
My SP episodes are starting to feel too real.,It seems like each night my episodes get worse and worse. Half of the time when an episode starts im wide awake and just paralyzed. I never see anything I just feel the pain that is happening to me. EX: during most SP episodes it feels like im being choked out and each time i try to move the hands around my neck get tighter and tighter. When the episodes are over I can still feel the pain from whatever was choking me.,1
Sleep paralysis pro! XD,"Happens so regularly I’m at the point where I know it’s not real, still scary AF though! I’ve had it where Ive felt someone spooning me in bed really tightly, then I’d turn over on my back but then it holds me down. Ive felt like I’ve been screaming before but then I awoke everything was silent and family still asleep (normally light sleepers ). I’ve had a little gremlin/devilish looking creature, quite small, at the end of my bed running down towards my pillow. All scary shit but I put it down to lack of sleep.When it happens now I literally just stay calm, breath , say to myself in my head it’s not real and then it stops. A lot of other experiences I have which happen more regularly than the physical stuff is just loud noises or the sound of someone speaking to me /shouting just as I fall asleep. It really does make u not want to fall back asleep again though. Aren’t our minds FUN !",1
Fine line between SP and dreaming,"So lately my experience has been different but just as unnerving. 

Currently, what I believe to be SP, occurs just as I’m getting off to sleep - I tend to get into REM sleep within minutes as I’m usually exhausted (yay for ambulance shift work); but this dream state is almost instantly interrupted by SP (I think). 

So I’ll be dreaming then *bang* pitch black. Followed by the realisation that I can’t move and everything feels heavy. Now I don’t hallucinate (thank f***) but I get a sense that I’m on a countdown and I need to wake before “something” reaches me. 

Now I don’t know if this is SP or just an extension on dreaming. I’ve never experimented with just relaxing into the feeling so I don’t know what the outcome would be. 

Additionally, slightly away from my thoughts above, but when I’m “thrashing” to get out of this state - I can clearly feel my body as a dead weight but almost as if my “outline” is moving instead. Trippy stuff. 

Can anyone relate?",1
A quick question,Has your sleep paralysis demon ever spoken to you?,1
New SP condition...,"I've had it since I was a teenager (43 now) and during the last few episodes I have an itch that I cannot scratch!

So last night I experienced my first SP,"So last night I experienced my first SP.. scariest thing i’ve ever had happen to me. I woke up in the middle of the night, hearing footsteps on the other side of my door. My door is behind my bed so I couldn’t see anything. I tried moving my head around, but couldn’t, I even tried screaming, I couldn’t. I Close my eyes in hope of falling asleep, but then I hear the weirdest noice ever. I can’t even describe it. I look up and theres a fucking 3 headed monster just looking at me. Then i closed my eyes and fell asleep. 
And honestly the scariest thing about this is, the next morning I go to School, and the first thing my best friend tells me, is that he had just experienced the same SP as me.... w.  T.   F.",1
Is this SP??,"I’ll try to be vague.. I’ve had sleep paralysis on and off in my teen years (21 now), but I think it’s coming back. It’s just so different I’m not sure so if some of you could maybe help me gain some perspective. 

Every time I fall asleep I am woken up by the loudest bang you’d ever hear. Like a car crash happens in my brain and it jolts me awake and I think I was in a bomb explosion or something. This just started about 5 days ago and it happens 2-3 times a night. Last night was the worst, I really felt like somebody was in my house. I heard loud running footsteps and an alarm going off, and I was stuck in bed I couldn’t move. I was terrified. 

I swear I wake up and these sounds I hear feel so real. I’ve heard voices, screams, and bangs/crashes. It scares me to fall back asleep. I just don’t know what to do cause I’m losing so much sleep I feel like I’m losing my mind. I cry every time cause I’m so frustrated. 

Sorry for the rant guys.. anything helps ❤️",1
First time experience with sleep paralysis last night.,"So I’m 23 and have never had sleep paralysis until now. I’ve had other weird things like hallucinating when I wake up in the middle of the night.  
  
Last night I woke up around 2am unable to move. I was hallucinating like mad, stronger than ever before. I saw text scrolling over every surface. I feel like I could read it but it immediately slipped out of memory.  
  
The physical sensation felt a lot like mushrooms if you’ve ever done that. Really stoning sensation except I couldn’t move if I wanted to.  
  
I cant describe how it felt mentally. Really weird. Like a trip kinda, and I felt a mental energy crescendoing within me until I snapped out of it. Imagine anxiety/tension/fear building within you except it wasn’t a bad feeling. Very powerful.",1
is this sleep paralysis or something else?,"Hi Guys,

For some time now, randomly during the night I get this weird sensation coming over my body. Sometimes it happens when i'm just falling asleep and sometimes i wake up to this feeling. So all of a sudden I feel this huge pulling force weighing on my body but also almost pulling me and I'm unable to move. I have to struggle a lot to finally shake myself 'awake' even though it feels like im already awake and just stuck. I always sleep on one side (not facing up) but it doesnt matter which side i sleep on, it happens on either side. One other thing I noticed is sometimes I cant fall asleep again without it happening again as im trying to fall asleep. Its very different to what ive heard about other peoples sleep paralysis but it feels like im being pulled into a black hole and I cant move.

Do you guys have any ideas on what i might be experiencing?

Thanks in advance",1

"Alien abduction, anyone?","I had an SP episode where I was lying in bed and all of a sudden I feel the strongest gravitational pull towards my open window. Outside the window it’s glowing green light, and the pull is so unbearable that I can’t breathe. I know in my heart I am about to be abducted by an alien ship. I try to resist the force pulling me upward- telepathically, with my heart pounding like a hammer against my chest. The most desperate and terrified I’ve ever felt. And then, suddenly, I begin to feel lighter. The green light fades and I can suddenly breathe again. The best relief I’ve ever felt. My heart slows its pressured beats and I slowly realize it was all a waking dream.

Has anyone else ever experienced some kind of abduction in their SP episodes?",1
its not that bad,"I have sleepparalysis once every few months and while its pretty horrifying atleast the first or second time you have it, its not that bad if you get used to it. 

Once i realise that Im in sleepparalysis I try to stay calm. The easiest way, atleast for me, to get out of it is to increase your breath frequency. Your body will get stressed and wake up eventually. 

If you know that you are in sleepparalysis you can do some funny stuff with your thoughts because you are almost asleep and dreaming. I once thought about the creepiest thing I could imagine and tried to dream it. The results were ... pretty disappointing... I woke up and had to laugh about how crapy this ""nightmare"" was, because I knew what was going on and that I could control my thoughts.",1
WHY would anyone WANT sleep paralysis,"Sleep paralysis is correlated with negative emotions and bad habits/lifestyles. Sleep paralysis is literally a nightmare! What people SHOULD want to induce is lucid dreaming, which is correlated with positive outcomes and habits. 

You don't NEED sleep paralysis to get into lucid dreaming. Yes, sp is on the way to lucid dreaming, but ONLY because sp is a disruption in REM sleep. So if you do a lucid dreaming technique wrong, your REM sleep may disrupt. 

I have more information about these sleep states and more on my blog. Please don't torture yourself with sp. 

I'll link my blog down below.",1
Sight Paralysed,"So I've suffered intermittently from sleep paralysis for about 7 years now, but an experience I quite often get is that my sight becomes paralysed but my body can move in a dream like state. So I'll be in a dream where my eyes are fixed shut, and if I force them open with my fingers all I can see is what I'm facing in my sleep ie. usually the light on the ceiling as I sleep on my back. 

It's so weird for so many reasons as it's not like conventional sleep paralysis where my body is paralysed, and also I can't understand why my brain knows exactly what I'm facing in my sleep with my eyes shut (although I suppose this happens with normal sleep paralysis anyway). Even when sleeping in a completely different room which I did last night for the first time as I argued with my partner, my brain knew I was in a different room so when I forced my eyes open in the dream I saw this different room. Bizarre.

Anyway, anybody else have an experience similar to this? I'd be fascinated to know.",1
Please help sleep paralysis but I can move,"This is my first time on Reddit and I've made this account to purposefully find out what's going on with my sleep.

I'll write two accounts of what's happened at two different times and see what you guys think of it. And I'll explain later on in the post about what it feels like. This has happened on more than the two occasions mentioned these two are just the most impactful times.

To start off I should say that I have been lucid dreaming all my life. It comes very naturally to me and I didn't realize it was weird until about age 15 (I'm 22 now). I dream very vividly every night multiple times and have very bad insomnia so.i wake up a lot in the night.

About 3 months ago I was asleep in my flat in Manchester. There's a train right outside my window so the room vibrates when a freighter goes past in the night and it usually wakes me up. So this night I heard the sound and i woke up. I saw something by my door and immediately started shitting myself and tried to sit up to get my phone. But I couldn't move and I was extremely distressed. This lasted for what felt like 2 hours with the thing still staying there and me desperately trying to move to sort the situation out.

Last night a similar thing happened except there was nothing in my room (most times this has happened I haven't seen anything demon like). I was trying to move and get out of bed for what felt like 2 hours. I was shouting my parents (this is at home) and I don't know if I was actually making noise as neither of them were home. I could hear the cat next door trying to get through my window and when I was actually able to move he was there so I know o must have been somewhat awake. Bearing in mind I wake up at the slightest of noise. When I did wake up it felt like I just broke out of what was happening to me and i was confused at why I couldn't move the whole time. 

Now to explain how I was feeling during these episodes. It didn't feel like normal sleep paralysis. I could definitely move without a doubt. I was literally grabbing the bed and moving myself with all my might only to end up back at my starting spot. When I woke up my bed was in such a state and at points when I could see clearer I was at different points of the bed and sometimes the floor. I could physically feel this as well and as someone with a lot of lucid dreaming experience it was not as it is in a lucid dream. I was physically exhausted from the amount of moving I was doing. I could also only open what felt like half an eye and what I could see was similar to that to mixing weed and alcohol (blurry, confusing and hazy). But I could definitely see and Could see myself desperately trying to move. I can't stress enough how much I was genuinely moving I wasn't frozen but so weak like when you are in a dream and trying to run fast but just can't. But I was absolutely awake. 

Please can someone help me I'm honestly terrified of going to sleep because it feels never ending and doesn't fit with any sleep paralysis symptoms and it's nothing like any lucid dream I've experienced.",1
Has anyone else ever seen this thing?!?,"Alien? Demon? Sleep Paralysis story..

   About ten years ago, I was living in downtown Indianapolis with a friend of mine.  It was a Saturday afternoon, and he was working an auto body job and had to be in that day.  I was home alone.
   For some reason I was tired and so I decided to go lay on my bed.  I never take naps due to a lifetime of lucid dreams and sleep paralysis episodes, and so I did not intend to fall asleep; just lie down and relax my eyes.  However, right from the start I had violated the first unwritten “sleep” rule I ever created, which is “Never fall asleep on your back”.  This is because sleeping on my back ALWAYS induces sleep paralysis.
     This is the most terrified I’ve ever been.  I’ll try to explain as best as I can.
    
   My eyes were closed and I was just watching the back of my eye lids.  I began to notice an area closing in on my vision, which was even darker than the backs of my eye lids, from the outside inward.  
   Once the edges of the darkness touched together and fully closed, suddenly I found myself gripping the wrists of something that was trying desperately to choke the life from me.  
    It was tall and long-limbed and looked very much like a grey alien does.  Its skin was pale grey and wet looking.  Its eyes were very big and glassy, like fish bowls filled with ink.  Same head as the grey alien, except much more gaunt and pronounced cheek bones.  And it had a mouth.  Kindof.  More like 5 or so vertical slits where a mouth should be.
   But the worst part were its hands.  They were fairly large, but his fingers were very very long.  There were joints spaced about evenly all the way down each finger, and each finger seemed to move independently from the rest, like a snake with a limited number of joints would move.  
  Since I was trying very hard to hold his hands up by the wrists, his fingers were wrapping around the back of my neck and around my throat.  
   I couldn’t think clearly because, the only way I can explain it is, he was scrambling my thoughts with some kind of static waves.  I had to will myself awake and just like a Nightmare on Elm Street scene, he disappears into thin air and my arms are at my sides.
   It was just as real in my experience as I am sitting here today.  Has anyone else seen or experienced this thing?!?  I’ve been dealing with sleep paralysis since I was five.  This was different.  Let me know!!!",1
how to induce sleep paralysis,"is there a step by step process that i can do? i just want expirence this thing once and never again.

can i play chess with my sleep paraysis demon?",1
People of reddit please tell me what just happened to me.,"So here's what happened, I fell asleep at around 1:00 AM in the morning. I ""woke up"" who knows when. I thought I was sitting there with my (eyes closed)- idk if that can happen in SP but that was the thing. I felt this absolute titanic shaking in my legs, I noticed they were up in the air so I kept trying to put them down on the bed (I thought I was having a seizure).  Now here's the freaky part I felt this presence in the corner of my room by the door, which was scaring me to new levels of scared. So I tried to scream nothing came out and every time I tried the shaking would get so much worse. Now here's the part that makes me question if it was SP or just some lucid night terror. I got up out of bed and went to tell me dad and rinse and repeat the whole thing six times. After telling my dad I would be back in my room I didn't even walk. (At this point I was pretty sure I wasn't awake.) And then I would experience the whole thing again. Finally actually woke up around 2:30 AM, is that long enough for my brain to experience that? What just happened to me guys?

To hopefully answer any questions yes I have been extremely stressed lately, yes my sleep schedule has been awful lately. 
The whole experience my eyes were closed except for once when my left I opened (couldn't see anything), and out of pure terror I forced it closed.

Edit: and what helped me was actually telling someone and taking a nice long shower.

Thank you guys for coming and responding so quickly you're all awesome. 

Also wanted to add for clarification I'm 16.",1
Does anybody else feel like someone is grabbing them during sleep paralysis?,I've been getting sleep paralysis my whole life but only in recent years have I statted to feel like someone grab me and touch me. What's even weirder is that it seems to be of a sexual nature. One incident that stands out to me is when I was in sleep paralysis and there were 'shadow people' (they look like 'fuller' black stick men to me with purple 'eyes' that look almost like a flame) standing around. One of them was thrusting his pelvis into me extremely violently as if he was trying to rape me and saying things like 'you like that you little bitch?' (no joke). Funnily enough though since then when I get sleep paralysis I don't feel anyone touching me now. Has anybody had a similar experience?,1
How to fight SP,"You can fight the demons/aliens/exgirlfriend/spirits or whatever whatever you call them easily.

If you find yourself paralyzed and unable to move, try to CALM down and focus on one point like your BREATHING and then force a movement(hands or legs are generally the easiest). Most of the time this works and you will wake up. 

Sometimes the entity is smart and when you move, you will move your astral body and not your physical bady so you won't awaken. But this doesn't matter as you will get to know and re focus on your physical body and breathing (MEDITATION)

Another more fool proof way according to some sources like Qur'an and ayurvedic texts is to sleep on your side as apparently the bodies energy flow is stagnant if we sleep on our backs or stomach and it's easy for them to paralyze you. 

The wierd dreams won't stop but they can not paralyze you so easily.",1
I want SP again.,"I've had sleep paralysis since I was 17 years old (26 now) and let me tell you, it has been a WILD ride. I could go on about my experiences as they vary from the ""boring"" pressures to the skin chilling sights, but that's not for this post. There was a few months that I would have an SP event almost twice a week. So often that I had gotten so close to actually figuring out how to turn them lucid... but for 6 months now I've had a dog. Since having Goose, I've only had a very mild event that didn't last very long. I kind of miss the SP events.

Is there a way to kind of ""influence"" sleep paralysis?",1
Hallucinating but not paralyzed?,"I’ve been having vivid, rememberable dreams for the past several days, mostly all “nightmares” (they were stressful but not scary) about breaking into others’ houses/preventing people breaking into my own, and mundane stuff like being late for work.

Last night I was having the late for work dream again, when I awoke suddenly to the feeling of something touching me. Something kind of sharp, but not pointy? Like the end of a ruler or something. I dunno.

I woke up with a jolt and kind of sat up to swat at whatever was touching me, but there was nothing of course... but at the foot of my bed I just briefly saw a silhouette of a person. It looked at me, then its head turned away and it just kind of... slipped around the corner from my view and was gone.

I was rather unsettled and confused but went back to bed anyway. After waking up properly in the morning I thought maybe one of my roommates had been in my room for some reason. I’ve asked them and they all say no.

Could this is SP? Or something else? I definitely was able to move. Maybe that was all a dream too?",1
Has anyone with SP embraced it and used it to develop psychic abilities/clairvoyance or anything of that sort?,"If so, how did you do it?",1

Experiencing sleep paralysis every time I nap???,"Hi. So up until 2 months ago, I had never experienced sleep paralysis. I'm a college student so my sleep schedule hasn't been 'normal' in years. I used to take naps almost everyday in between/after classes. But the sleep paralysis is new. It's always when I'm waking up from a nap, never during a full nights sleep, at least to my recollection. And its now progressed to happening EVERY time I take a nap, which is about 3-4 times a week. It's like my mind is awake but my body is still asleep, and I can't move or scream. I live alone and I have a reoccurring hallucination/dream/idk that someone is breaking into my apartment. I could hear them entering the door and messing with the lock, and loud footsteps coming towards my bedroom. I kept trying to force myself to move, for my body to wake up or scream or just something, but i was frozen. 

Is it normal to experience sleep paralysis this often, and so specifically associated with naps? I also got kind of nervous when I googled it and saw it could be a sign of underlying mental health issues :/         I guess it could also be associated with the stress of the pandemic? I've just been avoiding taking naps at this point.",1

My brother passed away a few years ago,"This is fairly short because for me they never last long. My boyfriend had gone to work around 6AM, usually this wakes me up and I back to sleep until around 9AM. This time, I fell asleep on my back, it happened so quickly I wasn't even aware I was sleeping, just immediately pulled into a dream. There stood my dead brother, and my sister who was standing in front of him with her back turned. I tried to tell her our brother was right there, tried to tell her to turn around, but as I was doing this indistinctive whispering got louder and louder until I woke up in sleep paralysis. The sleep paralysis only lasted a few seconds, it seemed like it had only really been a few seconds since I had fallen asleep, but I just wiggled my toes and woke up.",1

My first and only sp with an entity,"My worst and only experience was after I watched a horror movie. 

I 'woke up' and looked at the ceiling. But there was this transparent, starfish like think creeping towards me. When it was right above me it dropped down and slowly moved up to my face. 

I was confused for a second and wanted to laugh for some reason. But then it darted into my mouth, I could feel it feeling my insides. My heart, lungs, everything. I couldn't breathe as I convulsed. I was able to feel how my heart slowly stopped working and my lungs were unable to function properly. My head began to hurt as a feeling of hate filled me. I don't know how exactly I did it but I forced myself out of sleep paralysis. My face was beet red and my heart barely pumped but I was alive.",1
Rapid heartbeat?,Does rapid heart beat when wanting to induce SP mean I’m getting there? Like I’m not even nervous but my heart is racing like a mf,1
An interesting problem I feel is unique but terrifying,"  Sorry if this post is worded poorly or is all over the place. I just woke from this episode and needed to write it somewhere and hopefully find answers. I'm currently in somewhat of a frenzy and have a splitting headache from it. 

  So recently I've been experiencing this weird phenomenon where I can feel myself falling asleep.
Not like, the jolt some people talk about where they're falling asleep and feel like they're literally falling. But as in I'm laying in bed, and I feel my whole body turn completely numb, all while I'm completely conscious. It usually starts at my legs, then creeps up from there.
  I also hear a sound similar to when you have a big yawn-- that sort of rumbling sound in your head. Also, my heartbeat feels super pronounced, like although my heart is beating normally, it feels like it's beating super hard and super fast.
   I can snap out of this feeling, but if I do, when I try to fall back asleep, it just happens again. 
  To go into more detail of my exact feeling though, is I have my eyes closed, feel my body kind of ""turn off"" and the rumbling starts. I'm wide awake and fully conscious of what's happening, and sometimes I'm conscious long enough to start seeing a dream form. Usually I never get to that stage due to me either being scared or being in pain. Yes, the numbness hurts, surprisingly.
  Whenever I ""wake up"" from this and I open my eyes, it's kind of frightening. Sometimes I can see things like I'm dreaming, sometimes it's auditory, sometimes it's both. My vision is always super shaky and my body is also shaky, like I'm in a super intense earthquake.

One last thing, I feel incredibly sore throughout my body, but most intensely in my arms. Also, the headache I got from it is damn near unbearable 

TLDR; My body starts falling asleep while my brain is conscious when I try to go to sleep and the experience is terrifying and painful.

I don't expect anyone to read this, and I especially don't expect any answers. But, if someone could give me an idea of what this is, if I have some disorder or something. Or if someone also experiences this, I'd be grateful to hear about it. Thank you.

Edit: Just learned this is a form of sleep paralysis, predormital to be specific. I was under the impression that sleep paralysis was something you only experience while waking up, I had no idea you could experience it while falling asleep.",1
Several months SP free! Auditory hallucinations?,"Not sure what I’ve done differently, but I have been several months sp free now. So relieved! Last year I was experiencing it more frequently and now suddenly not at all. While I know visual ‘demons’ are common with sp (and I have experienced them as well). I more frequently heard my hallucinations: footsteps ascending the stairs, walking around the room,talking, and dogs barking (no longer have dogs but they sounded like dogs from my memory) to name a few. It always felt like someone or something was in the apartment that shouldn’t be and a sense of impending doom. 

Are auditory hallucinations common?",1
I think I just experienced sleep paralysis,"I think I just experienced sleep paralysis, I thought maybe it was a spirit or something, I was half asleep half in a dream, I was in a room and could only stare up at the ceiling while my body was hovering horizontally, the whole dream I kept thinking and feeling of a spirit or a ghost presence, I couldn’t move, speak, or yell, and then I felt a creeping sensation touching my body kind of like getting a cold shiver, and then forceful pressure holding my chest and arms down it happened a few times til I finally woke up it was pretty scary though I’ve never had that happen before. I went to sleep about an hour earlier and had a really terrorizing nightmare, I was being chased the whole dream and it was really vivid.",1

What is happening to me?,"So when I was a child I was forced to watch The Excorcist. It terrified me. After that time (all the way to being a teenager) I began having SP. I genuinely thought I there was a demon trying to possess me all of those years. I would wake up mid episode paralyzed trying to scream at the demon to get out of my room. 

Then I found out what SP was and that helped A LOT! All of a sudden having a name for it gave me the ability to talk myself out of an episode. I’d just say “This is that thing. You’re ok. Just let yourself wake up.” 

They’ve been gone now for years. On the extremely rare occasion that I have one, again, I can talk myself out of it.

But lately (the last year or so) something new has popped up. Last night was the worst it’s ever been. 

It starts in my feet. It feels like extremely heavy tension in the air, like the air is so dense it’s trying to compress my body. Then it works it way up my legs until it reaches my head. I hate it. It makes my body heat up and tingle. I don’t know if it’s also causing my heart to race or if that’s just happening because I feel scared. 

While it happens, I am wide awake. I can move and I see my room like normal. Tbh, what if feels like to me is that there’s something that doesn’t want to let me sleep. There isn’t a rhyme or reason as to what causes it. I don’t feel pain at all. Just uneasy and scared. 

Is this just a different form of SP? Has anyone had this experience or possibly spoken to a doctor? (tThats not really an option for me in COVID world right now...)

EDIT: I guess I should mention that I ALWAYS feel like there’s a presence in the room. I feel it when my eyes are closed and it almost forces me to open my eyes and check every time.",1

Sleep paralysis and false awakening loop where I cant move and keep falling over,"I will occasionally have flash awakenings (with many loops) and sleep paralysis at the same time.

I've tried to find someone else who knows what I'm experiencing, but I can't find anything. 
Normally, I have about 3/4 dreams every night. I remember them all very clearly and they're very complex and vivid.

I usually always wake up between 3:10 and 3:30am. (Among other times in the night, usually 1 or 12, and 4 or 5)

I am in my paralysis state screaming for help and trying desperately to wake up and have someone wake me up.

Quetzalcoatl,"Hello. Recently I've been having a lot of sleep paralysis. First two ones were the 'hooded figure' which just stared at me, looking down at me with no apparent sign of harm; it was merely observing me while I was laying on my back and gazed up at its glowing eyes. I did not feel frightened, just perplexed. The second time I was sleeping on my side and was within my duvet with a small hole to peak through and I saw the same being but only half of its body,it's long ghostly drapes which slowly moved by. 

The other week I was sleeping on my side facing the wall and I had a very prevalent feeling something was behind me and that immense paranoia, anxiety , and terror began to hit me very very suddenly during rem sleep. A very blocky snake & dragon like creature that resembled that of Aztec appeared in my vision as if I had eyes at the back of my head as the being was not in front of me. I was definitely paralyzed though I somehow managed to or simply imagined that I hid under my duvet in hope it would go away but the thing swepted right under with me with its tail and its face came right up to mine and gave such a mocking and sinister gaze like ""ha ha , you cant hide"". 

I woke up. I immediately searched Google ""Aztec snake"" and I was astonished by the results. It came up the God ""Quetzalcoatl"" which goes back to 1150 BC and doing some digging I find very intriguing information. ""Quetzalcoatl is believed to have essentially contributed to the creation of man"" and lots of more info that if you're interested you can Google yourself because there is a rabbit hole of this info. I've never heard of this thing before. I don't even know how to pronounce Quetzalcoatl. I've been saying to myself that it could have been a mere coincidence but the thing is, I would never have known about this being if I did not have this particular sleep paralysis. A very strange one.",1
Textbook sleep paralysis,"Last night I had an intense SP that was abundance in terror, paranoia, and just utterly saddened by the experience. I was sleeping on my side facing the wall and as soon as I fell asleep a sudden prevalent sense of someone behind me occured.

 I did not see it yet somehow I saw it and it was the grim reaper with even the sickle. It was scraping the back of my head with the very edge of the sickle, though a mere tingling sensation was felt. However, I thought this was it and I was just thinking in horror of what events were going to follow next. 

I recall a vague memory of being partly in two different realms at the same time , like I was dead and alive and I was merely being ""tickled"" or that somehow there was some law in the way preventing the reaper getting me. It was a very textbook horror fiction like experience.",1
"Phenibut, Demons and Nightmares","Disclaimer: Everything written is basically just a stream of consciousness written the moment I woke up. Apologies for poor grammar, spelling and writing. 

I couldn't move but I thought I was 
Every time I thought I woke 
Every time I was still in the dream
Time kept looping 
I was semi concious on my side 
Time kept looping 
I tried to get help so many times 
Nothing worked 
I was convinced that I had a serious injury in my right eye 
The only action I was capable of in the real world was murmuring for help

I'm pretty sure that what I just experienced was a semi lucid sleep paralysis. Multiple times throughout the trip I found myself laying on my right side looking straight ahead, this was the center of the 'time loop'. Each time after returning to this position I was convinced that I had stopped dreaming and was now in the real world. I would try in various different ways to search for help and with every unsuccessful attempt I would find myself back at the beginning. 

The senarious varied wildly in desperation and duration. In one I fought through obstructions in my room, out of the door and up the stairs to find [my stepfather]. I woke him with an incoherent outburst of dialogue, explaining that my eye was injured and something had fallen through my ceiling. After listening, seemingly concerned for a moment, he gave an antagonising look and said the words 'everything is going to plan'. Some attempts to rectify the situation were as simple as trying to turn my desk lamp on. However, although I could see my surroundings I was unable to affect them. 

Sometime into the dream I became aware of a presences in my room, watching me. On one unsuccessful attempt to end it I tried to fight the presence head on, which had by this point physically manifested as a large black floating head. 

At random intervals between lying in bed semi concious I experienced scenes that took place in an unknown forrest with my older sister. One detail I remember was a conversation between us where I asked ""did I take any drugs?"" to which she responded ""yes... Do you really not remember?"". It was in one of these forest interludes when I realised I was dreaming. I tried to study the details of my sister's face and read signage that were for some reason in the vicinity, all unsuccessfully, confirming I was dreaming. During one of the scenes the same figure that had haunted me in my room had appeared in the woods. Although it beared no superficial similarities I understood it as the same presence.

Much of what I experienced was consistent with stories I had heard of sleep paralysis. The shadowy figure fits the description of what most people would call a 'sleep paralysis demon'. During the dream I also felt as if my body was under immense pressure. Many times I tried to fight the force pushing down on me but was unable to.

In total the experience was completely maddening. Each time I found myself laying on my side and opening my eyes I thought that I had finally persevered and made it back to conciousness. But these breife moments of clarity would always without detection slip back into the surreal nightmare. I have no idea how long it lasted but for a brief while I was truly begging to question whether I would ever escape. 

[P.S] Shortly after recording this experience I recalled that earlier the previous day (around 3pm) I had taken 1.5 grams of a drug usually prescribed to people suffering from various forms of anxiety known as phenibut. The friend who gave the phenibut to me described it as being comparable to xanax. Throughout the day I didn't experience any tangible effects from the drug and eventually chalked it up to have not taken enough to be considered a recreational dose. Throughout the day I also consumed around 8 units of alcohol (on the lover side of average for me) so I'm not sure how much of an effect, if any, this would have had. 

This was my first time experimenting with phenibut however, I have since read that sleep paralysis and other sleep abnormalities are common side effects of the drug. 

This is also my first time experiencing sleep paralysis and I just have to ask ""how the fuck do some you people ever sleep knowing that you're going to go through this multiple times a week?""",1
Tingling/weird occurrence when falling asleep and sleep paralysis question.," So two nights ago, I recently pulled an all nighter and had to go to bed. I also tried attempting a Lucid Dream for fun but I'm pretty sure I was about to triggering a sleep paralysis.

It started with me attempting to repeat a random phrase in my head. I did it over and over and became relaxed. This is when my lower legs started to go numb/tingle. This rose up to my lower torso and then my arms. It felt like I was being put on sleeping gas.

I was still repeating this phrase in my head but I also started to freak out (heart was racing, starting to sweat, etc.) because I was in fear of sleep paralysis.

At this point, I was going to stop so I began moving my fingers and this had no problem. I was able to move and all sensations immediately went away.

If I had continued, would have I suffered a sleep paralysis?",1
What was your earliest sp attack?,What was your earliest sleep paralysis attack or sp attack or at least the first one you remember mine was when I was around 5 and it was this shadow of a kid who walked around my room for like a couple of times when I got out of the attack I thought it was real and went to my parents who just took it as a bad dream but now I think it was a sp attack and my house wasn’t actually happend.,1
Some questions about sp," Hi I'm a 13 year old boy who had 2 sp so far. The first one was when I woke up at like 5 am, tried going back to sleep and slowly started to feel my body going numb. Next thing I know I hear ringing noises and static..... then ROARING AND BREATHING IT WAS SO LOUD. It took like 5 minutes for me to wake up. I was so terrified.
 The second one was yesterday. It took like 5 seconds and wasn't terrafying at all. 
 What is strange to me is that I haven't opened my eyes in neither of them (i'm so fricking glad) is it normal?
 Now neither of them were as terrafying as the stuff I read about here so I want to never have a sp again. Is there a way to lower the chances of it happening again even though it happned only twice this summer? 
What I also noticed is that thinking ""your not real"" or ""your not scary"" helped me to wake up. Is this an actual way to wake up or was it just a coincidance? If not, any other ways to wake up fast?",1
Sleep paralysis and a dead sister,"I've never experienced sleep paralysis before last night. And given the circumstances I'm not sure what to make of it or even think. My boyfriend lost his sister yesterday in a very tragic and unexpected way. They were extremely close. Him and I were up most of the night crying and me just trying to comfort him. I fell asleep for a short time and then I was abruptly woken up by something pulling at my feet. It was like a nightmare in real life. The room was dark but I could see a shadowy figure at the end of the bed pulling my foot, seemingly trying to drag me out of bed. I couldn't speak, I tried to scream but all that would come out were muffled whimpers. It went on for what seemed like an hour and I was scared to look at the bottom of the bed. I was able to finally fall into a restless sleep.
This morning I told my boyfriend about what I experienced last night and his eyes got huge and his skin broke out in goosebumps. He told me he saw my foot moving last night and also felt something touch his foot at the same time. Right after he felt something touch his foot, he said the cat ran off the bed. 
He thinks his sister came to us last night and I want to believe him. It just felt so sinister. But it makes sense to me that she would appear and try in a way to say it's okay. 
I'm still kinda freaked out.",1
I think my sleep paralysis is the scariest,"When I have sleep paralysis I almost cannot breath since I sleep on my stomach, I also can’t wake up or open my eyes so it’s like I’m being held down by something and I can’t do anything except use all my strength to move or open my eyes. It usually ends when I get minor access to my body and move around with limitations then I wake up by focusing all my will and strength into opening my eyes or I land back on my stomach unable to move again and then I fall asleep sweating and breathing rapidly. I had one time where I woke up and tried to move but I barley could then I suddenly got weaker and my eyes began closing then someone entered the room and I tried to call for help but I couldn’t so I just feel asleep.
I’ll tell more stories later today",1
Sp dreams without a nap and an extra person and time travel and a headache,"Hi all! I've had sp for most of my life and since it's always lucid, I have sort of learned to accept and control it. Learning to calm down in my sp state usually makes me snap out of it faster and I've been practicing this successfully for years now.

It's gotten to be pretty consistent. Nearly all of my sp occurs when I take naps rather than during the night. It might have something to do with messing up the sleep stages. I dunno, but I've mostly stopped taking naps because of it. Also, every episode is accompanied by more or less the same dream. I'm always alone in my bedroom. The room itself changes and it might be my current bedroom, a past bedroom or something I don't recognize at all. In each sp dream episode, I'm fully aware that I'm sleeping and stuck in this sp state. I wander around the room in a state of mild anxiety, always finding a mirror to watch myself in. Even though my eyes are closed, I can see myself through my eyelids. I eventually go lay in the bed and try to calm down, pretend to be sleeping so that I'll wake up in real life. It always works. 

Today was different though. My alarm goes off at 6am and then again every 10 minutes of I snooze it. I kept snoozing it and going back to sleep so I must have messed up the stages again or whatever because there I was in my sp bedroom again. I was alone, sitting on the edge of the bed. There was a TV on in the background, playing music. Being lucid, I told the TV to play matchbox 20 instead. It complied, but only for a few minutes before switching back to something else. I turned back to it angrily and said ""No! I said play matchbox 20!"" And it did. I felt more anxious this time because I knew I didn't have time for sp. I had to get up and go to work.

 
I was about to go lay in the bed like I always do when suddenly one of my coworkers was in the bed with me. I have NEVER had another person be present in my sp dreams until today. It was as though we shared the room and I wasn't happy about it because she's kind of difficult in real life. She kept talking to me so I got up and went to the window. I could see myself reflected in it and I was younger and thinner, like when I was a teenager. Then my focus switched to what lay outside the window. It looked like some sort of crowded village or festival. The McDonald's was clearly from the 70s (I was born in the 80s) and I knew I had gone back in time. I bounced around the room anxiously before I finally went to lay down. It took so much longer for me to wake up this time. When I finally did, my head hurt and felt enormously heavy. I could barely keep my eyes open. This part always happens and I have to sit up immediately or risk going back to the sp sleep state.

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading my nonsense. It makes me feel better to write it down. Thoughts and ideas are appreciated. ❤️❤️",1
Hallucinations.,"So I don't know how many times I've had sleep paralysis. I do hower know that I've had two where I've been hallucinating.
The thing is, when that happend I kind of saw my body as if I were floating abow it. I know there is a thing called Astral projection but I know it wasn't that. Bcs I hallucinated that the girl from the ring crawled up to me, grabbed my head and wishpered into my ear😂the other one was that ants crawled into my ear and sung opera haha. But my question is, is that normal? That you can see your own body as if floating abow it when you are hallucinating while having sleeping paralysis? Sorry for bad English.

Also, advice, if you feel a headache, then you could try to wake up and it can prevent paralysis. That usually works for me!",1
How can I experience sleep paralysis,"I know, I know... Maybe you will tell me that I will regret it, and yeah I think I will but I just want to experience it. Should I just stay awake a lot more or..?",1

I feel something scratch my head,"So 2 years ago I had a lot of sp. I was actually very  curious about it and wanted to try. I knew it was the state before lucid dreaming but I never get into it.. The first time was weird, I could actually feel when I was getting into sp by the weird buzzing sound/noise you hear when your body's entering this weird state.
Anyway everytime I tried I was too scared by all the sound and weird body felling you get by doing it so I was just twitching my toe, getting out of this and returned to sleep.
A night I did provoke it. But I knew I was sp-ing by the weird noise I heard. And just before twitching my toe to get out something just scratch my head, like when you scratch a dog or a cat but stronger.
It fucking scared the shit out of me. It wake me up, stood and run to open the light, and sure there was nothing.
Anybody got touched or scratch in sp ?",1
Scared to sleep,I had sleep paralysis for the first time last night and now I’m scared to sleep. It’s very late at night and I decided I’m not gonna sleep tonight  because I’m scared I will get it again. I know this isn’t the best decision but the fear is overwhelming. I’m hoping tomorrow night I won’t feel as scared. Any tips on how to reduce the fear?,1
"Weird knocking during my SP dream, sounded sooo real","Haven’t had SP in a while but had a weird one last night. 
I could hear someone knocking at front door (I’m in an apartment so not too far from my bedroom). The knocking didn’t sound like normal knocking, it sounded like how it sounds when you hit something with a rolled up poster. You know that sound? 
So the way most of my SP dreams have been going are like this: I’m having a dream that looks like my room/me in my room experiencing SP, but it’s all in a dream. 
So for this one, me and my boyfriend were sleeping in my bed and we woke up and heard the knocking. We both were confused and didn’t know who would be here or why they’d be knocking like that, but I was paralyzed and kept telling him to grab my hand. He didn’t get why and I just kept saying “GRAB MY HAND!.” It was a lot of commotion and noise and it felt and sounded sooooo real. 
Then all of a sudden I break out of the SP and wake up, only to find all that was a dream and my apartment was quiet. Even though I was relieved, it was such an uneasy feeling realizing it wasn’t real.",1
Lucid Nightmare Paralysis Talking,"Is there a real name for this?  I have always had a combo of lucid nightmares and SP.  But now I can breathe loudly enough, or blow air, or make noises loudly enough to wake up my boyfriend so he can wake me up.  (Lucky for him right, it scares the sht out of him haha).  Sometimes I am also able to say out loud, “ wake me up!!!”   Tonight it happened twice.   The first time I was blowing air onto his back.  Then I fell right back into it and I screamed WAKE ME UP.",1
High pitched ringing in ears,"Hi there, tonight when I was trying to sleep I started hearing this high pitched ringing in my ears, so loud it was almost painful. It only would happen when my eyes were closed and once I opened them it went away. I ended up being so tired I almost fell asleep and it turned into full on radio static, SO loud it actually hurt. So I went to sit up and found I couldn’t move at all. I had never had sleep paralysis before so I was pretty freaked out. It only lasted a couple seconds until I figured out I could wiggle a foot and brought myself out of it. Is that sort of thing common? Is the ringing a symptom of sleep paralysis? I’m scared to go back to sleep and could use some advice.",1
This might be helpful/interesting,"So a follow up from my last post about something having sex with me in sp.  I’ve tried some of the things ppl told me like using white sage and getting a better sleep schedule. The white sage didn’t work so I started looking for help like therapy or something, even tho I felt like it wouldn’t work because I mean everything I experienced felt so real.  My family kept trying to say how I could some how be hallucinating or trippin out like mistaking the breathing noise I heard in sp for my own or something...

But believe me I considered that for the LONGEST.. like I’m a atheist and everything I don’t or at the time didn’t believe in that spiritual stuff. I didn’t even come out about it until I was almost 100% sure I wasn’t freaking out like during the breathing incident I made sure to hold my breathe for a while during it and even though I held my breath, I still heard it.  Like just think about the sensations you can even feel and not just during sp but after. Sometimes after it I can still feel the area of my body that was hurt or messed with.  Ofc you’d try to think “oh maybe my body is just heavily reacting to the hallucinations” kinda like a wet dream or whatever but cmon if you’ve experienced this u know what I mean. 

Anyways my mom knew someone who believes in spiritual stuff and she knew how to do certain things too.  When I called her all I said was “I’ve been having sp way too much lately” and I said nothing about the sex/breathing/noises and stuff because I still wasn’t comfortable talking about it to other people but it didn’t even matter because right after that she told me “hold on for a second I’ll call u back” and when she called me back there was another lady on the phone (I think it was her daughter) and before I even got to speak she said “so has this thing been having sex with you?” I was so shocked, I wasn’t sure I heard her right so she repeated the same thing to me then all i said was “yes” after that they basically told me a bunch of stuff and as the convo went on she started saying how she picked up some sort of aura on me except that it didn’t come from me but someone else.. 

-Anyways they started saying how I needed to get closer with God and start praying/ reading the Bible if I wanted it to stop and tbh even tho it only has been like a week or 2 since then my sp hasn’t been that crazy so far.. and basically that’s what made me start to believe like I assume she must of did something after I called her because how else did she know what I was experiencing just from saying I have sp?? And that wasn’t the only thing she figured out but the other stuff is too personal to share on here. Other people have said it their self, there’s too many coincidences guys please start praying and reading up on it. 

She even told me their story when she astral projected and how there’s 3 things. The body, soul, and spirt. And even this makes sense like how does everyone describe what falling into sp feels like?? It feels like ur being “pulled” in a way. Again if you’ve experienced it enough u know what I mean. It’s like we’re stuck, like for whatever reason our spirit is trying to come out but it can’t. And I think this is because we don’t know how to astral project but we’re more prone to it happening in a way.  It just makes to much sense like if u go over to the astral projection sub u can see how it’s kinda similar in a way or even how they use sp in order to project.

And lastly I’m not trying to force anyone to believe I just thought this all was very interesting and I’m not knocking the science of it at all.  I do think we hallucinate in it at the same time since we’re kinda in a dream state, and having a good sleep schedule definitely helps, it has helped me too. 

I apologize for making this so long but all I’m saying is think about this for a bit.  You’ve experienced it for yourself.",1
I Steel see my sleep paralysis demon after my sleep paralysis,"This also happens when i dont have sp but i am in a location that remindes me of a SP i had like my room. I still see the creatures i see in my sleep paralysis  in the shadows or around corners watching me, this causes me stress and some times the stress adds to other stress that leades me to another SP. And i am afraid of sleeping, because when i try to relax myself when i try to sleep i feel the presence of the creatures, but also i am afraid that not sleeping will only make all thing worse. What can i do to stop this?",1

Marble Man,"So for context I’m a 37 year old Female .  I’ve had sleep paralysis since I was 6 years old. I still get them now if I’m sleep deprived or feeling anxious . Anyway,,, This is where it began...

I remember going into a nice comfortable deep sleep , Then all of a sudden I see from the perspective of “Marble Man “ walking down my street , Walking through the gate, up to my house door ( At this point my little body was so tense) . I could never open my eyes or move a finger . He would gradually walk through my living room up my stairs and stand outside my room . This is where things get horrifying . He would come into my room ( He wears all black , Think black Morph suit) Comes to the side of my bed and tickles me with what I’ve always described as “ Marbles on the end of his fingers “. He would then leave and I could see him leaving from his perspective. Fast forward about 7 years so I’m 13.. In my dream it pans out the exactly the same as the last 6 years but I think stuff this !!! In my dream I wake up and follow him to the landing on the top of my stairs, I confront him and I never have that dream ever again...

Now I have the feeling of not being able to move when I have an episode of sleep paralysis but he never appears. However,,, The last time I had one I heard “ Stacey” in a very sinister whisper right in my ear and now I’m worried he may be manifesting himself to come back....

Is this an other worldly being ? , When we have an episode is it one foot in another terrifying universe or is it simply just a dream ? Who knows but I know one thing ....At 37 it still doesn’t get any less scary :/",1
"Does anyone else have this weird sleep paralysis ""sensory overload""?","For context: I often have moments of sleep paralysis, but they usually do not last too long I believe. What I'm describing in this post only happens every so often, no more than once a month and this was the first time I remember this happening in at least 4 months. 


So sometimes when I'm asleep or dreaming, it seems like my dream suddenly gets cut off suddenly (like, in the middle of the dream) and then replaced by these extremely loud noises. Almost like static or random noises like voices, alarms, etc. Then once I wake up from it, and hit that stage of paralysis, it's like all the noises are BOOSTED and even louder as I try to move. 


So for example: just a few minutes ago I woke up from hearing those noises in my sleep, and I could feel that I was paralysed but not only did the static noise get extremely loud (think of putting a computer speaker directly onto your ear and turing it to 100%, that's how loud it was), but I also started hearing the noises in my own house a lot louder than ever, and a random alarm siren thing and voice at the same time. This noise got louder until I was able to move, but even after I was able to get up and look around, I was still hearing that noise loudly, just not as loud as before. It settles after a few minutes of being awake. The noise sometimes gets louder if I try to move during paralysis as well. 


Does anyone else have experiences similar to mine? I remember this happening to me even when I was a little kid but could never explain it properly till now.


Edit for clarity: When I have normal bouts of sleep paralysis (this, way more often than what's described above) it's just a few light sounds of static or grinding, and not nearly as loud as what I described above.",1
When I was a teenager,"About 15-18 years old, I experienced extremely strange and vivid dreams and sleep paralysis hallucinations. For a long time I abused the otc sleeping medication diphenhydramine, taking large doses to experience the weird effects. I believe this greatly contributed to the sleep paralysis. I've been looking for a place to share my experiences, and this just seems like the right place. I'll try to keep these explanations brief.
1. My first experience with sleep paralysis was as a young teenager, about 15. As I slept I would wake up, but not all the way, like we've all experienced so many times. I felt weight on my chest and the sense that someone wanted to hurt me. I felt as if I was screaming, but when I finally awoke for real I wasnt. This happened many times.
2. A year or so later I began having very strange and vivid dreams, too many to count. Often of being lost in a strange dreamscape or being chased. 
3. At this point I begin having what I think where either very vivid dreams or straight up hallucinations. In one case, I ""woke up"" and sat up in my bed to see my room become elongated and take on the shape of a road overgrown with foliage. At the end of the road was one of those dark figures we often see. Realizing I was still asleep I woke up, immediately was paralyzed by fear. I slept in a loft bed, with a curtain around it, and I saw a hand under the curtain and sensed someone close to me. I think I fell asleep praying, too afraid to get out of bed.
4. In another very vivid dream, I saw myself laying in the middle of a highway in what looked like hell. Infront of me some distance away was a tall demonic looking figure, it ran towards me and jumped on me pinning me to the ground. This was accompanied by the feeling of a huge weight on my chest. It looked into my eyes and I got the feeling the air was being sucked out of my lungs. The fear woke me up. 
5. Since entering my 20's these dreams have stopped. Although, I still experience sleep paralysis and hyptic jerks frequently. 
6. I saved this for last because its definitely a weird take. At the time of this, I owned a dream catcher that I had acquired from an antique store (bad idea). I believe this might have been the cause. I'm very superstitious.",1
I was stuck in a sleep paralysis dream loop,I went out drinking last night with my friend and crashed at her house. I had a dream about getting up starting my day and then i walked into a room in my house and was paralyzed. I was paralyzed in the dream and was going in and out of reality state and dream state. I couldn’t officially break out i could wiggle my fingers a little but couldn’t wake up officially. I went back to the dream of starting my day and walking into the room where i got paralyzed. This happened maybe 4-5 times and then this time was different. I was paralyzed but there was a guy sitting behind me in a chair. He was older i think wearing a blue suit with a gold line on the pocket and smoking a cigar.  He had kind of an ugly face with bloodshot crusty looking eyes. He said you are linting. You need to see the difference or you will never escape the loop. I went through the loop again of the dream and being paralyzed. This time i could fully see the room i was actually in and i felt someone grab my throat. I knew i was moving my finger on my leg but my leg couldn’t feel anything. I broke free but i guess not completely because i couldn’t keep my eyes open again. This time dream loop i went into my closet instead of the room.  I had an urgency to find something. It actually looked identical to my closet at my house which was strange to me. The door was swinging slightly and i said to myself this is it maybe i am dreaming. Immediately i was paralyzed. Hands grab my throat. I WANT TO GET OUT a male voice screamed it felt like a hot air was pushed on my face. I was able to break free this time and i didn’t feel like i couldn’t keep my eyes open this time. And i definitely DID NOT go back to sleep,1
Non-scary Weird Sleep Paralysis experience,"I was taking a nap when I had a sleep paralysis episode.  I usually don't halucinate but this time a felt something touch my back. I don't know why but I decided that it would be best if I just kept calm and thought about it in a positive way and it felt good and went away. I think the weirdest part was that I hallucinated leaving my body. I know it's just my brain but it felt so real. I didn't fully leave it or anything I just pulled halfway out and got tired. I remember thinking to myself that it felt tingly? I'm not really sure why. It's crazy what the brain can do. I think learning to keep calm during sleep paralysis makes it go much smoother, so I'll remember that next time I get it.",1
Has Anyone Else Never Been Scared During SP?,"I've flown around my room, been choked, heard someone enter my room, had my mind flash disturbing images, been sat on (idk it felt like someone had sat on me and I could feel their bones digging into me lol it hurt) etc, but I've never felt threatened during sleep paralysis.

Idk if it's because I was aware of what it was before it started happening to me, so I knew it wasn't real and not to panic, and the trick to get out if it by slowly moving your toes and fingertips, or maybe it's because my mind isn't fully conscious? I still feel half asleep when it happens and my main focus becomes going back to sleep again lol and when it comes to uncomfortable things happening during paralysis all it does is annoy half asleep me, whereas if I was more awake I feel like I would be terrified because I would be worried my brain would make me hallucinate something really scary. 

I've also never seen a demon when I have opened my eyes (i would never open my eyes during sleep paralysis consciously btw, but half asleep me doesn't give a shiiit lol) but I have seen a cartoon ladybug (??) that dotted around my walls for a bit so uh yeah that was kinda interesting.

Anyway yeah I hope this keeps up because I don't want to end up traumatised 😬",1
I think I've had my fist case of sleep paralysis,"TL;DR: feeling of dread and pain from dream fades into reality

So, a bit of context, first, i known what SP is and the different effects it may have in different people but I've never suffered it to this point, secondly, one of my biggest fears is not being able to move ou react when in danger, it really causes me to panic. 
So to the story, it happened yesterday,  it was a night w many dreams, complex and long dreams, and after the last dream i woke up, but it was like 7:30 in the morning, since im not working neither going to school because of covid, i just went back to sleep, and i had this weird nightmare where i was at my cousin's bedroom, with other people that werent him, but i also dont remember who they were, anyways, the dream was all black and white, almost cartoonist looking, and i get a very bad felling that im being watched by something behind the door, so I go there and open it, and there is an monster, like, imagine the shape of a drop o water, but reverse, it was round where its supposed to have shoulders and gets thin at the bottom, and its face is like slenderman's, plain white, and from this moment on, i start to fell my back and ears burning in the dream, but slowly it fades to reality as i ""wake up"", when i realise that im fully awake but i cant move for shit and my back and ears are burning just like in the dream and it hurts, and i get the same felling of being watched by the door, only now i know what's behind the door, but i cant see it because i sleep belly down and facing the wall, and suddenly all stops and i get up in a jump like what was holding me down just let go.
It was weird, but didn't quite scare me like a thought it was going to be. During the experience, the moment i realized that what was happening was SP, i was calmer, and just tried to move some muscle, I've read somewhere that if u force some muscle to move, like a finger or an eye blink, u snap out of it. So that's my story, tell me what u think it might've been",1
my fan saved me,"i woke up like 2 times while sleeping but after i awoke myself the third time shit just felt like it pulled me right into a different place, and so i realized i had sleep paralysis. the funny thing about this is that i had my fan on and for some reason it sounded loud as fuck as if it was literally some avalanche falling directly onto the ground right beside me and it somehow snapped me out of it i guess?

this is my 2nd time having a really conscious SP and one thing that i know for sure is to never open my eyes because fuck me if i wanna deal with some demon trying to eat my dick or some shit",1
Any tips on how to fall back asleep following a SP episode?,"Some background info. I’ve been having sleep paralysis episodes on and off since I was a kid. They tend to be more frequent when I’m stressed out or have a lot on my mind, but I usually don’t have more than one or two a month. My episodes are usually pretty mild due to the fact that I don’t have a lot of visual hallucinations. Every now and then I will, bit they’re few and far between. My hallucinations are mostly auditory or tactile. For example, I’ll hear someone banging on my door or feel someone touch my hair. I’m pretty good at snapping out of it and waking myself up, but I haven’t mastered the art of falling back asleep. After I have an episode, I’m always so scared I’ll have another. I’ll stay up for hours just completely exhausted and fighting sleep because I’m afraid of what will happen. I usually wait until the sun comes up and then I feel comfortable enough to drift back asleep. Do y’all have any tips? I just started grad school, so I can’t keep missing out on sleep like this.",1
Sleep paralysis after listening to stories of it,I’ve always know about sleep paralysis and what it was. I had never experienced it until one night. I watched a video talking about a dudes ayahuasca expirence and he got sleep paralysis for days after. Here’s the link https://youtu.be/eosN5ZKwEzQ. Anyways that same night I woke up around 6 am I couldn’t move and I was looking at my wall as a black hole was expanding. The whole time I was trying to move and scream but nothing happened. I was so scared to sleep for days after it was weird it happened right after I listening to this story.,1
I scared my fiancé this morning because I was whispering numbers while I was having sleep paralysis.,"I’ve had sleep paralysis on and off for years now and last night was the first time I’ve had it in months. 

I had really bad sleep paralysis last night after having a dream I was on a boat in the dark ocean. I started to come out of the dream and my body froze while I was half awake. I couldn’t see anything in the room but I felt someone lean into my ear with the deepest voice I’ve ever heard and start whispering numbers in my ear. They sounded angry. I don’t know why but I started repeating the numbers they were saying, over and over.

Eventually I gained control of my body again and woke up to see my fiancé standing at the edge of my bed, freaked out. She was getting ready for work and she said (in her words):

“What the hell were you just doing? You were saying all these random numbers and you sounded like you were trying to summon a demon” 

I told her I was having sleep paralysis and she just kinda shrugged it off. Probably my top 3 weirdest sleep paralysis experiences I’ve ever had.",1
Scariest SP (?) episode,"I have been having SP for about 6 years now, have experienced every symptom from levitating to hallucinations so I know all the steps to get myself out of an episode fast. I also experience sleep paralysis while I am not fully awake most of the time, just in a super vivid dream of being awake.

The other night I “woke up” and was laying there and could tell I was entering into a SP episode so I started to wiggle my toes and my fingers. After a while nothing changed so I assumed I was just awake and this was reality. I got up and walked into the bathroom and when I turned on the lights and looked in the mirror two SP demons were standing behind me. This immediately sent me into a panic attack and I fell down and started crawling on the ground and felt hands grabbing at my legs. After a little struggle, I just shot awake in actual reality now.

This completely disoriented me. I felt that the dream was sooo real that now reality didn’t feel real, very hard experience to explain. I ended up going into my roommates room and she just casually talked to me so I could ground myself back in reality. I went back into my room and watched a little TV then ended up falling back to sleep no problem. 

Just wanted to share this because it was truly an experience like I never had before and really shook me up.",1
"This might help, not sure tho, its just an idea","When you have sleep paralysis you see your room and some scary halucinations,right?So what happens if you wear eye cover? (i dont have sleep paralysis so i cant try, but a video was recomended on youtube, and i came up with this)",1
SP Under control... usually.,"I have had SP for as long as I could remember, possibly since a very young age. Long enough that I know how to prevent it; don't take naps during the day and don't fall asleep laying on my back. 

I haven't had an episode in over a year or so. Last night I had one of those freakish ones you read about, the seeing things kind. 

I never had one of those SP episodes when you see or hear ""demons"" or weird noises. Mine are mostly the awake feeling, hearing what's happening live and in real time, but unable to move or speak out loud.

However, last night I was laying on my side going to sleep and I opened my ""eyes"" to see a black figure standing near my window, looked like a black witch with a witches hat but no facial features. As usual, I ""screamed"" for my husband to wake me up or shake me out of it but he didn't ""hear"" or ""feel"" me move. I was stuck in SP...I was finally able to shake myself out of it and eventually went to sleep with no issues. 

I spoke to my husband the next morning and he freaked. He said, I was visited by a demon called the Hat Man, and he blamed it on me watching shows like Ghost Adventures...which I love.  He thinks that by watching shows like that I am inviting evil spirits and opening myself up. This is not the first time he has said this.  I said, absolutely no way and that was that.  

Anyone feel there is truth to that or a connection? Watching shows that involves spirits/demons and SP?",1
Freaky sp demon,"I’ve had a couple of instances where I’m n ot sure whether it were sleep paralysis or not, but I do know that this one was. My sp demon had very aggressive sex with me. It felt so weird and I had to go and talk to a school counselor about it. Weird times. This was a few months ago and I was pretty shaken up about because the guy was huge-he was built like a wwe wrestler but luckily I haven’t had another incident like that.",1
Felt like I was being sucked into a tornado,"So, to start this, back in 2013 when I was fresh out of high school I worked a job that was 4-9am every day. I eventually being addicted to zzzquil because I could not fall asleep. Because of this, I would routinely have lucid dreams and/or SP. They were never really vivid enough to scare me, and I didn't think they were, or could be as scary as they potentially can be. 

Between 2013-now I haven't experienced anything except for the occasional wake up to a loud noise and feel like I was stuck, but it would quickly fade and I would be fine. 

The reason I'm posting this is because I think you guys might find it interesting. Yesterday I fell asleep at around 430am, which is common for me, as I love the night time. Around 5:30am I had an intense dream that involved me walking out to a beach, grasping a beach towel(?) Or maybe a blanket and holding it out in front of me. As I walked towards the beach, there were tons of huge tornados everywhere. I remember walking close to one, and getting the ""sucked up, floating"" and eventual perpetual freefall feeling. This woke me up into a very intense SP state. I couldn't move and I could see but just barely. My hands were grasping my blanket the same way I remember holding it in my dream. I just kept feeling like I was falling, and honestly, I felt like I was dying or having a heart attack. I haven't experienced this feeling in a long time, and it has never been that vivid. When I snapped out of it, I remember trying to walk to the bathroom, but everything looked so fuzzy, like I had water in my eye or something. 

I eventually got back in bed and just laid there, completely full on anxiety. Thankfully my wife was just about to wake up for work, so I was able to talk to her about the experience. She has never had an episode and didn't really understand what I meant, but it felt good to talk with her about it. I was able to sleep after she left. I'm about to sleep for the night and I'm just hoping it doesn't happen again. That was the most on edge I have felt in a long time.  

Anyways, that's about all I can remember. I wish I could have had my Fitbit on and has a heart rate reading, because I bet it was weird. Thank you for reading if you made it this far, and thank you for giving me a place to talk about this. It makes me feel better about the whole experience.",1
I think I just had sleep paralysis,"I just woke up and could see my room, but nothing would move. It’s like I was staring at a still image of my room. I moved around some things like my stuffed bear, I was shaking it a bunch but it just stayed still. It’s like my eyes couldn’t actually see anything that was happening but I could feel it happening. I reached for my phone to call my mom but I obvs couldn’t see to call her, I couldn’t speak neither it was like something was holding me back. I started waving my hands infront of my eyes but still couldn’t see anything that was moving, just a still image of my bedroom the way I first saw it when I opened my eyes. I have eye problems to begin with so this freaked me out I thought my eyes were messing up. It felt very real but I’m assuming it was sleep paralysis and I was actually still asleep... although I grabbed my phone and when I finally snapped out of it my phone was in my hand. So I think I was doing the movements but I was still half asleep? I’m not sure but it was very freaky and weird.",1
my boyfriend experienced sleep paralysis and I just want to help him however I can,"I’m new here, I have viewed reddit threads thru google for advice but was driven to actually get on here after this. My boyfriend smokes quite a lot of pot so he usually never remembers his dreams these days but has been able to lucid dream since he read about it at about 8 years old. He moved in with me a while ago now and I should let you know I’m a very spiritual person (he is becoming more so too) my apartment is covered in crystals, I read tarot, I burn sage/ Palo santo, etc. He has very high anxiety and recently will wake up with a weight in his chest without reason, and I’ve mentioned recently although he doesn’t remember his dreams he may still be carrying something in his subconscious through them even if he doesn’t remember. I’ve always been susceptible to nightmares but have never experienced sleep paralysis or anything like what he explained happened last night. I woke up around 4:30 AM absolutely terrified to see him making noises that sounded like he was trying to scream and was moving as though he was in like a straight jacket. I yelled “BABY!!” A couple times and had to shake him to wake him up. He woke up bawling his eyes out hyperventilating and I just did my best to comfort him and remind him he was safe, it was just a dream and everything was okay. Basically what he explained happened was we were somewhere where a friend of his had passed away, and his spirit was there, he locked eyes with the spirit and was and I quote “more scared than he’d ever been in his life, terrified”. I stayed awake until he fell asleep again (took about 2 hours) before I also fell asleep. I’m not looking for explanations as to why this happened as I don’t want to scare him more. I’m just asking for any advice on how to force himself to wake up from this kind of a thing in case it happens again/ any advice for me with regards to reassure him/ any knowledge that would alleviate his anxiety. I love him so much and felt so helpless. Thanks in advance guys I know people are very supportive here",1
Occuring sleep paralysis/dream,"I have this often, and i didnt realize it was sleep paralysis then until recently and i didnt know where to go to seek knowledge and was thinking people will dismiss it as a nightmare and laugh. But i am quite the spiritualist so i know is shouldnt happen more than twice and you dont manage to wake up and get up go toilet and go back into the same paralyisis dream/situation. And i sleep beside the window an it involves a shadow figure too, which i am not really intimidated by as sometimes i am woken up by partner while shouting and hissing at it too try scare it off as thats all i can do as i cant move at all, but few times my partner hasnt been woken up by me hissing and shouting- my ahouting at it has woken me out of it and then i see this shape by the window and at that time i am drowziness sleep and feel so powerless apart from my speech, its loud enough to wake my neighbours. Last time i was reciting with God's name like i was performing an exorcism. I take antidepressants which to be taken at night and knocks me out and thats when i experience these reoccuring events, if i dont take them my anxiety keeps me up all night and i barely get sleep! This is the first antidepressant that actually works well with me. I would be most grateful to hear a bit more and understanding. Thank you",1
My experience in SP,"Hi everyone am new here and honestly I did not know they have a SP group am glad to see theres an actual group on this subject it pleases me to see am not the only one with this problem the only thing is I dont know if I should talk about the experience I had. It all started when I was 19 I was sleeping in my bed. All of a sudden I wake up facing the mirror only to find out I could not move I saw everything normal what I could see with my eyes like a normal person would when all of a sudden from being inside my room In a blink of the eye I was seeing everything black and In front of me was a door its was far away but I knew it was a door. And in that door fire was coming out from the edges when all of a sudden the door exploded open and a lady comes out she was floating her hair floated a little like if she was under water here eyes black and hatred consumed her to a point were you could see like vapor wrapping around her like an Aurora. Honestly shes not ugly compared to other SP experiences I heard of. Shes scary by the way acts but beautiful in her appearance. She keep getting closer and closer until she floated almost next to me and I was trying to get up from the moment I saw fire around the door because I knew what was coming believe it or not. She got up to my face and smiled menacingly with a grin on her face and told me I'll always be watching you.... and I broke free of my SP. But it does not end there. I woke up scared to death,I saw my room, and i was like ok at least I woke up when all of a sudden my door of the room opens little by little and I see a black shadow of a women peeking through the door( its was almost 2am. I could tell it was a woman because of the long hair she had dangling down as she peeked through the door) and then shes closes it slowly(since I just woke up from SP I was still lightheaded so I did not care at the moment and went back to sleep after that) but as soon as I realized that I always lock my room and keep the key and copy with me I woke up ASAP, jumped out of my bed opened the door but since it was locked I just crashed into the door. Out of desperation I unlocked it and went running through the whole house. Checked the 3rd,2nd and 1st floor I even went outside to check around the neighborhood to find nobody. I was concerned. Went to my room and did not sleep all night.ever since that day I constantly have SP in a week I can have from 3 to 7 honestly I got used to it except for the last one I had like 2 weeks ago. It overwhelmed me I was shaking uncontrollably, my body felt like a earthquake never seen In the eyes of man, my jaw was moving from
Side to side.up and down, literally my body felt like it was trying to be controlled... and I think it did because I was still in SP but I saw myself get out of bed dragging myself to the door and when i opened everything was dark( and that's weird cuz it was 5:30pm) i could only see what was in front of me. Honestly I only have fragments of what I did but I saw my dog go up to me like always when All of a sudden she started to whine like an Afraid puppy and went up stairs all I heard was her whining and crying on the second floor. My body felt soo heavy I could not move.  when I woke up I felt like Sh** extreme pain in my bones and muscles I even woke up disoriented for like 3 hours. But after that I haven't had one.... at least for now",1
Why do I have sleep paralysis everyday?,"I’ve been struggling with SP for all my life and now it is effecting my marriage. Every night I am intensely shaking, tossing around, making weird noises. Some nights I have SP maybe 20-30 times. 
   When I was a teenager, I was trying to have lucid dreams. Dreams was so vivid for a while I couldn’t wait for getting to bed and dreaming my best life. I know it is sounds weird but dreams was more exiting than my life at that time. So, question is what is the relation with lucid dreaming and SP? Maybe, I am triggering it subconsciously while I am going into REM sleep I am forcing myself to awaken?I wonder why do I have this condition. I just wanted to hear other if you guys can relate.

    I wanted to go to sleep study but I don’t have insurance for now.",1
First Experience? Thoughts?,"I don't know how to to start this off or even if this was sleep paralysis. But this happened a couple months ago.

I was sleeping well trying to sleep. I felt extremely tired, so tired and had this sensation feeling of tiredness all over me but I for some reason couldn't sleep? I tosses and turned, went on and off on my phone then it happened.

For some short period of time I was asleep I cant recall how long but it was really short, I need woke up tired, wondering why I woke up. I dont remeber exactly what happened I was moving around etc finally got to sleep again.


While I was sleep, Im not entirely sure I was completely asleep this time? I kept hearingg something? Thought maybe it was the curtain banging up again the window but idk. Then i saw a face which scared me.shitless. it was wearing a white mask. 

But this time something weird happened. It felt like my whole body was shutting down, my heart was racing abnormally fast like it was about to pop out of my chest. I was concerned, and honestly thought I was going to die. I saw the white face, I tried my best to move. I trief to get up realised I couldnt, then trird to move at least my arm. Well I couldn't and thoight I was dying or having a heart attack so i started to fight harder because I didnt want my parents to find me deaf in the morning (I have a fear of dying in mu sleep). I stopped because it was useless, I was scared shitless and thought that was that. Im noy sure how long this went for. I woke up the next morning.

The white mask felt a presence to me, I felt as the room got colder and hearing things which didnt help.


I havnt gotten anything since or never.",1
There's a woman that torments me.,"She has long black greasy hair, her arms and legs are like 3-4ft long, her eyes bulge yellow, and she has like, lots of horses teeth almost, she has a torn white dress. And she always stands in the same place, facing away from me hyperventilating.  Then I sit on my bed and feel her face on the side of mines. I only wake up when I look at her and she screams. I always need a few minutes to catch my breath.  I havent slept in around 3 days now. Im so tired",1
Dreaming during SP?,"Ok, so I’ve experienced Sleep Paralysis a handful of times. I used to say that I experience to often, but I’m starting to think that I don’t, that maybe it’s something else? Or maybe it’s just some different version of it.

Whenever I did experience sleep paralysis, I would be in the stages of waking up. For example, I fell asleep while studying, and when I woke up, I heard someone downstairs cleaning/putting away dishes. I tried to get up but realised I couldn’t, and started panicking. Then I heard someone come up the stairs, and come into the room that I was asleep in. At this stage I woke up, only to discover that no one was in the room, or the house even. And none of the dishes I had to sort out were dealt with. All of the other times were similar to this. 

But other times, I’ve experienced something somewhat similar while actually going to sleep rather than waking up. Take last night, for example. I was laying there, waiting to drift off when I felt myself entering a dream. But I was still conscious. It’s literally like going through some veil and entering the dream world. the dreams would be very vivid, and I would feel everything. I mean everything, to the point of pain. The more I would try to force myself out of the dream and to wake up, the more aggressive the dream would get. And the more my body wouldn’t move. I’d feel myself tensing and trying to move both in the dream and physically but nothing would happen. When I do manage to wake, I’m groggy as though I had been fast asleep, tense, and usually pins and needles. If someone had grabbed me or anything in the dream, there would be an ache there.

I had believed that this was sleep paralysis as I feel very awake, I can’t move, I’d barely be able to breath with the pressure on my chest, and it’s usually a nightmare. I remember each and every ‘dream’ I’ve had during these moments. But the thing is, I’m dreaming. My eyes aren’t open.

Last night it happened 3 times while I tried to go to sleep. To the point I considered not sleeping at all. I know I won’t sleep properly tonight, worried it will happen again. Each time it happened, it was as though I was going back into the same dream space, and whoever was in the dream was waiting for my return. I’ve often got pissed off when this happens. In reality and my mind. All I’d want is to actually sleep, dream, even have a typical nightmare if it came to it. But being ‘awake’ in the dream is beyond scare and frustrating. And I feel like I’m going nuts because of it. I’ve even argued with my own mind during one of these to leave me alone because all I wanted was to get a proper nights sleep. 

I’ve noticed when I did have sleep paralysis before that I’d have aces and pains after from being so tense, but with this, it’s as though I feel everything that happens me. Last night, for example, something was rubbing my back. But when I tried to leave the dream and open my eyes, it started to increase in pressure until the point I felt as though I had been jabbed or stabbed. That area still feels sore if I rub it.

Has anyone here who suffers with Sleep Paralysis experienced this? Or something similar? I’ve tried looking it up and it all related back to it being that. But I’m not sure. I always believed that I’d be awake, eyes open, if it was sleep paralysis. Not awake with my eyes closed in a very vivid dream like state.

I’ve also considered that it’s simply a nightmare, but I’ve had those also and it would usually wake me up, with little memory of what really happened in it. I wouldn’t be entering it with a very clear mind.

I did look at the top post about knowing what SP actually is because a lot of people question it and if they have it, but I’m just not sure if this is some form of it or something more.

Update: I’ll also note that after this happens, when I get out of the dream, I would go through a very mild version of actual SP, but it only lasts for a few moments. My body would be rigid, but because I’d been fighting to get out of the dream space, I’m still pushing to move once I’m in SP so it never lasts too long. Though that depends on how bad the dream was.",1
My experience with sp,"I used to have SP since my early teens,at first it was terrifying , some say that sleeping on your back attracts it ( always slept on my stomach ),and i had it quiet often, before having it the first symptoms of it would be goosebumps and weird sensation in my lungs , i feel like getting dragged from my bed to the bathroom vividly and sometimes losing gravity and floating towards the ceiling , also i feel like screaming for help but I cannot talk and my anxiety is going through hell , i get auditory hallucinations of cars and motorbikes nearby but there is none but with time i got used to it and it was quite fun a bit. I used to get it once a week or twice for quite sometime but now I haven’t had an episode for about 4-8 months. I started sleeping on my back a year ago. 

For everyone going through this, it will pass and eventually you will get used to it and maybe use it recreationally haha!",1
Confusing reality with dreams,"I’ve had troubles with sleep paralysis since I was little. I also frequently lucid dream and I’ll wake up feeling more tired like I was running around for hours. Usually when I wake up from a dream it feels so real that I wake up scared and confused and don’t know where I am at first. And then I’ll have this feeling like I was ripped out of somewhere I should have been and I’m not where I’m supposed to be. It’s not every night, but it does occur enough to upset my days. Some dreams will linger with me the whole day. 

Tonight I had a lucid dream as usual but passed out whilst in my dream causing me to go in to some strange state where everything went black but I was conscious and fully awake, but I couldn’t move and I started lifting from the bed and spinning. Obviously this is all in my head and I was in fact imagining this but it feels so real like I was being lifted. 

Honestly just looking for some similar experiences to make sure I’m not losing my mind.

Edit: I also forgot to add how lightheaded I feel after waking up. Especially tonight, it felt like my brain was thrown back in to my head. I’ll be so lightheaded that I can’t really move at first and it’ll take a bit to get my strength back. Even after I’m able to move and begin comprehending my surroundings, My head will feel like I was on a rollercoaster",1
Calm Sleep Paralysis EPS,"Last year, sleep paralysis was common for me. The majority of them were me laying on my side then floating above my bed, then going back down. 

A common thing that happened during my episodes is my feet would move slowly as if I was doing tippy toes but backwards towards me

Despite having so many SP, I’ve yet to encounter a SP Demon. The only “creature” I’ve encountered was when I woke up to a mouse sniffing my ear and moving around my bed. 

Does this mean anything?",1
My SP last night effected the real world somehow,"I should preface this with 2 things. 1st, I regularly take naps in my car during my lunch break. I work 3rd shift so that should normally be around 4am. 2nd, I often record my dreams and regularly have lucid dreams. This felt very different to that.

In the last 2 weeks, I've had sp twice during my lunch break nap out in the parking lot. The first time, just last week was quite odd by itself. When I first noticed I was experiencing so, I also noticed a presence behind me. I convinced myself through the horror of that, that this must be a dream and as such willed myself to move. Out first, I couldn't, and I tried quite a bit. Soon after stopping my initial attempt though, I had this feeling that something was being pulled from the top of my head, and this terrified me. I didn't need to think about it, I just got out of my car and started running. It was odd to me because this wasn't my first time with sp, and I thought for certain that I wouldn't be able too, but no less, I managed it. About 10 ft or so from my car though, I felt this physical barrier. It seemed to stretch all around my car, even though the parking lot was empty. 

With no where else to run, I decided to turn around and face my SP demon. Much to my surprise though, it just wasn't there. It's presence was gone and I couldn't feel it anymore. I saw something much more horrifying though. With my car door still open, I could see a black mass lying in the seat. It wasn't motionless either. Though it stayed in place it's appearance was animated black, with a surface like a violent, turbulent ocean. I understood it better asleep than I did awake, and just started crying until I eventually woke up. I did in fact, wake up back in my car.

The second happened last night. I fell asleep and immediately noticed it. This time a presence was in the back seat directly behind me. I tried doing what I did last time. I recalled the feeling I had of something being pulled from the top of my head, and began trying to move. I only managed to turn my head this time. I saw, out of the passenger window towered a silver truck.(all vehicles tower over mine, I drive a tiny Ford Fiesta) Im more than certain there was no truck there before sleep as I park pretty far out of the way, I don't like being near people while unconscious after all. Before I could look anywhere else though, from the center of my back I felt something pull me into the seat.

I thought this is where I'd wake up because I was still in the car, but it wasn't yet. My arms were now crossed like a mummy and the presence behind me began to speak. It sound like a sultry woman, but slightly more innocent. She said ""What you did and we're trying to do again is very dangerous, for both you and for me. I won't be permitting you to do so again."" I was more scared now than I was the first time. I felt like the SP had happened in my dream and that this woman had sort of imprisoned me by pulling me into an even deeper layer of the dream. It scared me to think that she had more control than me in my own dream. I felt like I was literally tied to the seat, not unable to move, just physically prevented from escaping.

The woman leaned over the back seat a d started choking me from behind. She continued to speak, but I just couldn't comprehend most of the words. She seemed somewhat upset, but also angered, like she was threatened by me in some way as though I had done something to her. As she ranted on, her voice became more hoarse, and I could tell she was choking back more than a few words. The few sentences I could make out we're: ""Don't you dare hurt her,"" ""You better not fuck this up,"" and something along the lines of ""won't let her do it again."" 

At this point I wasn't just having trouble breathing, I was actually coughing and gasping trying desperately to breathe at all. As I feel like she's finally about to kill me, she lets go of my neck with the words: ""...but it's not my place to judge you yet. I will see you again but only after what you're going to do."" She disappears. I could sorta see her before, I could make out her hair and the outline of her figure while she was reaching over me, but now she was gone. Practically turned to dust. I awoke soon after at 4:16am.

As I went to head back inside, I turned around to lock my door and panicked. I thought blood was spattered on my door. It turned out it was just a few berries crushed against it though.(I didn't think to take a picture right away, but I got what was left of it after cleaning most of it. It was regrettably smudged though) I did a walk around and noticed 2 hand prints on the rear passenger door. No one using it. I use the car exclusively for work and never have passengers.

Anyway, I'm terrified of this, ofc, but have any of you guys had similar experiences? Can I even call it SP since I did manage to move out first? Either way, I took pics of the berry smudge and hand prints when daylight permitted. You couldn't see them in the dark to well, so links to that in the comments

EDIT: I should've noted that there is no woman in my life she could be referring to. I only work and sleep, and boy do I like my sleep

EDIT 2: it seems like a lot of people are forgetting how my car was effected. I know my phone camera doesn't pick it up well, but what do you think of the hand marks in my car? To me they seem stretched out, like what children do in finger painting, which concerns me alot. My windows were open too, so if anything wanted to get in, it easily could. I feel like my car was intentionally marked.",1
I just had the strangest most vivid sleep paralysis in my life.,"Holy crap... I fell asleep at on my boyfriends couch (he’s away right now, in another state). I woke up, unable to move and I then realize, okay I’m having sleep paralysis. This happens to me a lot, so I’m kind of used to it. But then, by boyfriend walks in the door and kisses me on the check... what the fuck. Still unable to move, I just close my eyes hoping my body will wake up soon. When I close my eyes, I heard voices.. I couldn't make out what they were saying, or i at least don't remember what was said. I opened my eyes and noticed someone’s legs sitting crisscrossed to the left of me... low key freaked the fuck out in my head and was telling myself not to look at its face because well, its not real. Well I look at this fuckers face and just LOL... It was a horses head on someone’s freaking body.. like looking down at me. Lmaoo then things got so strange.. I must have been really falling into a dream state because I swear I touched it and felt it (this made me panic more cause I was like wait.. is this real?). Next I start trying really really hard to move my body and wake up. I picked up my hands and put them in front of my face... it felt like I was actually moving again... but my arms were still at my side and weird white squiggly outlines of my hands was in front of me. Like I was leaving my body. Then I look to the left and the horse guy found a friend.. she weirdly looked my friend Jenna. Finally, after what felt like hours of hallucinating (It was probably 10 minutes tbh), I jolted up and screamed. It was an accident to scream out loud but I was trying so hard during everything to make words that it just happened. I do remember being able to say ""help me"" at one point and I tried breathing really heavy to wake up. Meanwhile all this was happening, my boyfriends dogs were running around the couch playing. I guess made it feel more real.. like everything in the home was normal, except for these visitors. Does anyone know why this actually happens? This happens to me about once a week, and if i nap 100% of the time it will happen. This just happened to be the most intense times I had it and I felt the need to write it out.",1
Sp visited me while napping in the car,"I work at a hotel on the beach and we have to park in a parking garage. I was especially tired after working a double, 10 am to 11 pm and i live an hour away from home. I felt like i was too tired to drive so i decided to park all the way at the top, where no one ever parks, and take a small nap in the backseat of my Chevy cavalier before i drove home. I woke up frozen, feeling like there was someone sitting on my chest with their hands around my neck. It felt like someone was pushing my car up and down and shaking it from side to side. I have a 2005 Chevy cavalier it’s a tiny car and doesn’t take much pressure to make it bounce. I heard Male voices outside my car and saw shadows but i couldn’t understand what they were saying. I could hear them yelling at me inaudibly still shaking my car i felt completely paralyzed and i couldn’t even move my eyes. Someone slammed on the car hard and yelled WAKE THE FUCK UP BITCH. I sat up drenched in sweat the car was fogged up and no one was in vicinity",1
My SP (I think) Experiences,"So, I’m currently 15 turning 16 later this month. A few days ago I’m pretty sure I had my first sp experience. The day before it I had set an alarm for 7:45AM because I wanted to watch a stream that started at 8:00AM. I ended up finishing it but since I woke up at 7:45, I was still tired so I decided to go to sleep. Then I wake up to this feeling that a dog was breathing rapidly on my nose and mouth and I couldn’t move. I don’t remember much but my fingers weighed a million pounds, and in this state somehow I knew this was some type of sleep paralysis but I wasn’t scared, just really weirded out. 

My second time though happened about 30-40 minutes ago. I woke up at around 8:30AM today so when 5:00PM came around, I felt tired and wanted to nap. Once I had drifted off, I woke up to a slight pain (unrelated to sp). When the pain subsided, I checked the time (5:56PM) and drifted off once more. I awaken to the same feeling of a dog breathing on my nose/mouth and my fingers weighing a ton, except this time it felt as if I was getting goosebumps in my ear canal. There’s really no way to explain it well but it felt like the inside of my ears were shivering/twitching really fast, and it would come every few seconds. This whole experience was weird because I didn’t know if I was awake or asleep because I could still hear my neighbors children playing outside, but I was paralyzed. After it was over, I checked the time once more and it was 6:04PM. 


I tried to search up what was happening to my ears but I couldn’t find anything on the web so I came to Reddit. Has anyone else experienced this ear canal twitching/shaking/shivering feeling or does anyone know what it is?


Edit: I forgot to mention that when I had my first experience, I was at my aunts house and she owns a dog, but the door to the room I was sleeping in was shut so there was no way it was breathing on me. I later confirmed this because my second experience happened in my house and I do not own a dog.",1
My experience,"About a week ago I got sp for the first time in a looong time. I felt this woman that I dont know reach out and touch my back and speak, couldnt move.
Yesterday, Aug 12, exhausted from work I heard this incredibly loud ringing and I couldnt move. When it was over it started again.
I think I will add edits if something like this happens again so I can see a pattern. I hope nothing happens. It's too terrifying.",1
"A UFO, pizza man, and a head","This happened a few years ago and it was one of the scariest moments in my life. 
(I am also on mobile so sorry for any weirdness)

I was laying in my grandparents basement and they have a couple of those small half windows just at ground level so it only lets in a bit of light. I had a few episodes of sleep paralysis before so when I woke up and couldn’t move I knew what it was. Then I started hearing a deep, constant wubbing and I see a beam of light going through the windows. And I am FREAKED OUT. 
After the light passes I hear someone at the other side of the room ordering a pizza and then I hear a pizza man coming down the stairs (I have closed my eyes at this point) and I hear him give the pizza to the man who ordered it. And as soon as he got the pizza the pizza man took out some kind of blade and decapitated the head of the guy who ordered it. My heart was pounding so hard as I heard the head hit the floor. The pizza man then grabbed the head off the ground and I know this because he started walking over to me so slowly and I could hear the blood dripping from the head getting closer and closer. And as he approached the couch I was laying on I could hear him breathing close to my ear and suddenly I opened my eyes and moved my hands and it was over. 

TLDR: A UFO lit up the basement; a pizza man showed up and decapitated the customer and approached me.",1
My body was remote controlled - SP or AP?,"I was using a YT video to help me Astral project last night.

I didn't notice falling asleep, I felt conscious the whole time.

However, at one point my body started to move on its own with my head hanging down and sitting up in bed and about to stand up, I didn't understand what was happening to me and was overthinking, because I was not the one moving my limbs. And I didn't know what my body was about to do next. 

And taking in my surroundings I suddenly noticed a third hand somehwhat bigger than mine touching me and moving my body. I got scared and bit the hand really hard. 

A bit later I think I woke up lying in bed.",1
"Do Western beliefs produce more ""hellish"" SP nightmares? What about Eastern beliefs?","A therapist I spoke with about this said that almost all of his clients who grew up in traditional Western religions more often encountered ""demonic"" type characters in dreams, while the ones from Eastern backgrounds did not...  Could that disparity comes from western religion's emphasis on heaven, hell, judgement, guilt? 

For example, my SP nightmare was a devil face which hovered over my bed and seemed to paralyze, suffocate, and inflict intense pain on me for about a half hour.  The therapist suggested that this figure was based on the religious ideas I grew up with.  That made some sense to me but I'd like to cross check that because my one experience was extremely intense. 

So I'm really curious if anyone on this sub, from a non-Western culture, has had a demonic or devil type beings terrorize you in your dreams?",1
My first experience of sleep paralysis (I think?),"Ok so I'm nearly 17 years old (in a couple months) and just earlier this night at about 3 am or so I got pretty tired so I tried to go to sleep, I tossed and turned like I usually do to get to sleep, and once I found a comfortable position I closed my eyes and started to drift away into sleep mode whilst thinking of things about life. I can't say exactly when it occured it kinda just happened but all of a sudden I ""almost?"" Woke up but my eyelids were flickering I couldn't move, but I could breathe. 

Then (I don't know how many people know this game) but SCP containment breach the SCP 0-96 ( This is it:  https://youtu.be/QBBh-b1g-3A)   

I could hear its scream inside my head and I heard thundering footsteps and I kid you not I thought I was going to die so I started trying to do anything possible to move and then all of a sudden BAM I died, jk. I could move my eyes freely and the screaming and footsteps went away and then I regained full control after that. Well that is my story, I don't actually know if it was sleep paralysis or some crazy dream but all I know is that I was in fact concious when hearing the scream and footsteps. 
Also any opinions on if my guess is correct or not of it being sleep paralysis?",1
2 different SPish experiences,"So, I was dreaming. That was a strange dream but nothing special and I struggle to remember a whole picture. Only thing I can recall is the wood house, that is all. At one moment I started waking up and I was like.. shite man I am lucid dreaming... but it went wrong. My consciousness sucked out from the dream and entered a dark state, just the voidness around. I knew my body was laying on the bed and my mind was somewhere else, so I started calming myself. like.. maann, you know what is going on, you are awake but your mind is caged in the place it’s lost control on the body... and I reclaimed calmness and that was pretty odd. But soon enough my whole body started vibrating inside, it was so intense i thought i was gonna dematerialize. I kinda freaked out and one thought occurred to me.... move... just try to move. Because I was kinda scared.. not scared actually. It was indeed a strange feeling. And i tried.... But I failed.. once again I told myself.. You knew you would fail and just do not freak out further. So I got myself calmed and later I had a feeling I woke up completely. Suddenly some uncontrollable emotion forced me to jump out of the bed and start screaming, but I did not play that game. I maintained the position on the bed and continued sleeping. 
Strange thing is that I experienced something I thought was SP before. Let me tell that story too. Couple of years ago I woke up and felt a presence of the most evil creature on earth. I saw a silhouette but not really.. it was feeling that this creature was standing right next to my bed. I have never felt that overwhelmed. This creature was the evilness itself. And I got so scared I jumped from the bed and broke out from my room by destroying the doors. I was screaming.. scream of fear.. scream of terror.. scream so strong that one only can produce when seeing a devil.",1
Cute sleep paralysis demon,"It's a classic story. You wake up, you can't move and you start hearing weird sounds and seeing men/monster shaped shadows. Well, tonight i saw a cat sleeping on me. It was so cute",1
Another episode,"So I tend to get/have sleep paralysis up to 2 or 3 times per year, it always seems to be a shadowy figure that's standing next to my bed or hovers over me. I never really knew what triggered it, but last night it happened again and I remember lying there with this figure stood in my room and I was breathing so rapidly. I always seem to try to gasp for help, last night was no different but I can't get my words out, kind of sounds like trying to hum with my mouth open. I've been feeling a little anxious over the last couple of days because I've been waiting on higher education assessment results, so I'm not sure if that has triggered it? Either way, it's a pretty crazy experience and it's good to know that I'm not the only one that experiences it!",1
I played myself and triggered sp,"I hadn't had sp in a while and thought I was safe... WRONG. I ignored several red flags and really brought this episode upon myself.

I foolishly decided that last night at midnight would be a great time to watch The Haunting Of Hill House, a truly terrifying show IMO. One of the characters in the show experiences sleep paralysis *RED FLAG* 

My sleep meditation app then lulled me into a false sense of security and told me to sleep on my back, which I did despite it being a sp trigger *RED FLAG* 

My dreams started off relatively normal before morphing into the plot of Hill House where I became the character with sp. It was truly a mistake to watch this show.

My immobilized ass stared passively at my closet where the shadows morphed into monsters and crept towards me... I finally woke up whisper-screaming after what felt like hours (this happens every time - why do I always think screaming will help?). My dog was quite alarmed by my whisper-screams but mostly in a ""why have you disturbed my slumber"" kind of way. 

I don't know why I didn't put 2 & 2 together and realize that I had created the perfect recipe for my own terror and distress...

Has anyone else triggered sp by watching a movie/TV show?",1
My crazy sleep paralysis story I wrote when I woke up in the middle of the night (levitation),"
Before I went to sleep I was lying there and imagining me in football and people just running at me and hitting me and I kept jolting and panicking almost sounds like ptsd and then when I finally went to sleep I suddenly opened my eyes couldn’t move didn’t panic because this has happened to me multiple times but this was way worse. but I tryed to just fall back to sleep without trying to get out of it but then I opened my eyes because I couldn’t then my eyes forced shut somehow and I could feel both my legs levitate and start to take my body with me but I prayed and they slowly went back down the whole time I was prayed a prayer that is gods prayer that I don’t even know but I knew it was gods prayer in my sleep but not when I woke up I forgot the whole prayer it was something about repent for my sins is all I remember and then my eyes opened again and still couldn’t move for a while then suddenly came back to regular. I didn’t ever freak out but it’s definitely sketchy. Oh and a few minutes later I hear a reoccurring low pitch beep going kind of fast like less than a second at a time outside never heard before in my life.",1
3rd person perspective,"So my s/o said that she gets sleep paralysis every night. and that she can sometimes see herself sleeping and a figure. She says her eyes are closed but she can still see everything around her, she can't open her eyes, move, or talk, and she feels like it lasts for an hour. When I asked her about being able to see the figure if her eyes are closed but she said her mind recreates her room (this is where she sees herself sleeping). Then I asked her to describe being able to see herself sleeping. And she said, she wakes up but she feels like she's unable to move, and then she described being able to see herself sleeping like some sort of 3rd person video game, but she can feel everything around her, and if she falls asleep with a tv on she can hear the tv but it looks like it's off, and if there's a window, everything is black, she also says that the light is off but she can see everything perfectly fine, and then the figure sits in the corner staring at her, but she can't see its face (there's 2 corners it likes to sit in but the edge of her bed is also an option for it). I've never had sleep paralysis so I don't know what to say, or what it's like, but I want to get her help. She doesn't want medication or therapy though.",1
I saw myself during sleep paralysis,"I’ve experienced sleep paralysis countless times now. My most intense moments were when I felt someone grab me and say “I’m always watching you” (I kinda laughed during this as it’s a inside joke with myself) and when I felt myself having sleep paralysis I opened my eyes a baby screamed straight in my face and walked of. 

However this moment disturbed me the most weirdly enough. I was having sleep paralysis opened my eyes and I just saw myself opposite me fast asleep. Didn’t move or say anything just sleeping. 

I’m not sure why I saw myself but idk why but it’s just doesn’t sit right with me. I feel as if there is some underlying meaning. Anyone have any thoughts or similar experiences?",1
When/How often do you get sleep paralysis?,"Just had my first SP episodes in a while and I was curious to see when/how often other people get SP!

For me, I usually get SP when waking up, especially when I wake up earlier than I should/want to. Sometimes I end up falling back asleep after a while lol. A few years ago though, I used to get SP when I was falling asleep. Thankfully, I don't get SP that often, maybe once every few months, but when I do, they always seem to come in clusters - like I'd get them two or three days in a row. Also, weirdly enough, I don't seem to get SP when I'm away at college, but I used to get them in high school and now, since I'm back at home.",1
Whispering in my ear,"The other night my sleep paralysis was telling me to kill myself.. Has anyone else ever experienced that? It felt so real & I remember thinking ""I need to remember this in the morning because it was so real"" Or maybe it was an evil spirit? Who knows",1

Wondering if I’m the only one or not that doesn’t have visual hallucinations during SP.,"I’ve been having sleep paralysis since I was about 7 or 8. My poor brain didn’t know how to handle this. I didn’t know what it was. It was a time way before google, so I came up with the one thing that it could have been; aliens.  I came to that conclusion because I watched a movie about aliens ( Fire in the Sky), and there is a part where they cover something on the guy that make it so he can’t move. The only difference I could tell between him and me in that small part  on the movie is that my eyes couldn’t open at all. I could never open them during  all of my episodes. This is still the case for me. I certainly do have auditory hallucinations and that ever present feeling of someone standing next to my bed or over me, watching me. I just wonder if anyone else has the same thing. 
Thank goodness that we had internet, even dial up, when I became a teen. I found out what I was actually experiencing.",1
My First Cases (i think),"Hello everyone, i think i’ve been experiencing my first cases of sleep paralysis but honestly can not pin point if it is that ..
Some brief information on myself before i explain my experience is that i’m in my early 20’s, i have only just recently gotten over a marajuana addiction (been a week sober) and please don’t judge. Also this has never happened to me before until i had quit ..

What’s happened isn’t to the extent of seeing someone/something in my room, i haven’t heard voices or breathing, and it has happened to me whilst laying on my side/stomach.

So what’s happened is 3 times tonight where i’ve tried to get some sleep, i have felt my eyes under my eyelids start to go crazy with movement, i then started hearing this noise which sounded like an old 80’s sci-fi teleportation/warping sound (it’s hard to explain what exactly i heard), which wasn’t loud the first 2 times but on the 3rd time it was so loud i could barely hear myself think.. and then i am unable to move or open my eyes for a solid 45 seconds to a minute .. i am completely aware in these moments and it seems i can only break free once i mentally say to myself “1, 2, 3” and then rip my arm in the air very intensely, beacause if i tried slowly i just wasn’t able to move anything ..

If anyone can help me with what this is or how to help then please let me know, low key freaking out but i know this sort of stuff happens to a lot of people. Thank you !",1
"Has anyone else been ""physically"" choked by the shadow man?","Last time I had sp I had the shadow man trying to choke and kill me. He jumped at me very quickly and put his hands around my neck. I could feel the sense of pressure, this lasted for 10 seconds or so but it was very scary.

Anyone else experience this?",1
Anyone’s eyes constantly rolling back during SP?,"Hi all. First post on this sub. This has been happening to me for about 5 years now. It’s very rare for me (tends to only happen if I fall asleep on a couch, chair, etc. somewhere other than a bed.) at first I thought it was just a dream until I started piecing it together that It’s always a POV from where I fell asleep. 

I’ll “wake up” with my eyes rolling back very rapidly. It feels like I just drank a whole bottle of vodka or something, like I’m extremely intoxicated and have lost control of my body/eye balls. (Keep in mind, I rarely drink anymore, and when I do it’s not much.) in this state I will try to stand up and walk around, and sometimes I feel like I’ve actually stood up from where I was lying down. The problem is, once I’ve moved to a new spot I will be sent right back to where it began. All the while my eyes are still repeatedly rolling back. 

Eventually I will snap out of it. Time seems to not exist in this state. I wouldn’t be able to tell you how long this can or has gone on in the past. I always wake up covered in sweat after one of these experiences. And it leaves me in this state of panic and anxiety for the next few hours. 

I’m not sure if this is considered SP or not. I’ve been doing some research on it, and I haven’t seen or heard of anyone experiencing anything similar to it. I’d love to hear some thoughts if anyone has any idea on what exactly is happening to me. Thanks for the help, guys!",1
Back from another terrific sp episode,"[Latest story with some background sp experience info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/hhq83o/still_scared_af_despite_being_well_used_to_it/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

So since last time I've done like a few more but nothing crazy.  Lately im actually not afraid  to sleep on my back and to have small sp...

Went to bed again drunk and high.. woke up at 5am because of the heat and was not able to sleep until 7-8.. I start to feel asleep on my back and hear screams, I feel the sp is coming so I immediately turn to be on my side cause it's supposed to be safer... And immediately it starts... 

Extremely strong classic feeling of having something or someone on top of me crushing me and pushing me. However, I feel like I'm able to move (which was I think part of the hallucinations) so I'm not feeling like I'm in sp, esp because I'm on my side. I'm thinking I'm just hallucinating.. but I can move so that's not sp.. the fact I think i might not be in sp makes the whole thing scarier. This thing keeps crushing me very hard. 

I was dreaming/hallucinating that I was in my bed but it was not my room. It was my old kid bedroom at my father's house back to the time I was in the same room as my brother. This room comes back a lot in my dreams/sp and this is where I had my first scary sp experience (see previous story).
But my eyes were open and I could actually visualize what I had in front of me in my current room. So yeah  purely sp. 

So this thing keeps crushing me it really last for a crazy long time. I also hear some bestial breathing. I feel a hand under my linen and I decide to take it. The hands defo feels like a monster hand, and  It shakes mine very strongly while still crushing me. I decided to try to throw myself out of my bed and also try to wake up my brother by screaming, I did feel like I was flying on top of my bed until like 2 metres from it, getting closer from my brother but then I'm back to my bed like a magnet.

After this, I think I went back to dream deeply cause I felt like I could turn to the other side and found someone next to me. Not a demon tho just a person I know it became gross and it triggered the awakening (on the other side)

I never had such a long episode with so much confusion and uncertainty about the fact I could actually move but still having all the sp symptoms.
I'm grateful my brain decided to end the experience like that and not making me see a demon next to me or I think I'd be traumatized again...
Until I think I turned to the other side it really felt fucking real 

See you soon for more sp adventures",1
Felt like there was an earthquake during an episode,"Has this every happened to anyone else? I just joined the sub and I’ve been having a lot of sleep paralysis episodes lately, just the usual creepy person staring at me from across the bed or being squashed. This time, however, was much different. I actually felt like an earthquake was happening. My ears were ringing to badly it began to make me want to scream and everything looked as if it was falling and shaking around. I realized I couldn’t move so it must be sleep paralysis. I just closed my eyes super tight until I woke up, which took a little bit of time. I have NEVER felt more scared in my life, I was so powerless to do anything and thought for a second I was actually stuck in my body during an earthquake.",1
how do i induce sleep paralysis,i've never experienced sleep paralysis and i want to put myself to the test (built different),1
Did I just have SP?,"Sorry for the basic question, I'm just not sure if this counts? I've never had it before, but I have heard about it. I'll just explain what happened.

I was having a dream where I was imagining this teacher at my school talking about sports, when I suddenly ""rewinded"" what he said to better fit what he would have said irl. But then I started to be a bit more aware in my dream (I've never lucid dreamed before either).

Before I could realize that I was more aware, I opened my eyes. I had this sense that somebody had just walked into my room. I told myself it was just in my head since sometimes I get that feeling when I imagine that happening.

I closed my eyes again, and I started to feel the air above my face get different? It was like I was losing feeling in my face. I opened my eyes again and tried to look at the door in my room.

I couldn't move my body. I tried moving my face and I was able to move my jaw. I took full advantage over the little bit of movement I could make and started moving my jaw a lot trying to ""wake up"" the rest of my body.

It actually worked? I'm not sure if that was a coincidence or not, but after I moved my jaw for a few seconds I could move again. I sat up and immediately looked at my door. My muscles even hurt a little bit after, not sure if that is related.

I ask if this was actually SP because I wasn't sure if I just just dreamed all of that or not? Plus I didn't have any of those hallucinations people talk about (thank goodness).

I read that post on this subreddit that explained SP for people like me, but I still wonder because I didn't really fit *all* of the criteria. Anyway, I really hope somebody can help. I'm sorry if I'm wasting anyone's time, and thanks for reading.",1
Sleep paralysis/lucid dream crossover?,"I had the strangest episode last night, where I had a dream that I had been drugged at my own birthday party. I was at a massive cabin and it had my family, friends, coworkers, old teachers and random acquaintances. I remember feeling very over stimulated by the sheer amount of people in my dream.

My family and friends were trying to help me walk, but I kept collapsing and dropping my purse and my belongings. I remember feeling actual embarrassment and I woke up slightly and couldn’t move my body. 

I fell back asleep into the same dream. Continuing on, I received gifts from old high school/college professors. I have been out of school for 5 years now, so I found that odd.

My stomach started hurting in my dream and I woke up and actually made it to my restroom. I was still feeling very sedated as if I was in my dream—the usual intense “panic” of sleep paralysis was masked, but still present under the surface.  

I fell back asleep into the same dream yet again, and was told I was delirious and needed to rest. So there I was, watching myself sleep in my dream. 

I’ve had extreme sleep paralysis dreams and lucid dreams, but this is the first time that they have crossed over. It almost felt like I was traveling to a separate dimension?",1
Sleep paralysis & false awakening,"So I suffered with sleep paralysis on and off for years. I've not had it recently, but I've been having having false awakenings maybe once or twice a month. Last night I seemed to have both at the same time. Crazy hallucinations in my room ( Some big weird demonic bird sitting in the corner of my room, and some rat like demon trying to pull my arm off), but then waking up thinking everything's fine but realising I was still unable to move and then the exact same hallucinations started again. This felt like it looped for hours. I'd actually taken some valium before going to sleep as I'd literally not slept for 3 days due to anxiety. Thought it would help but obviously not haha! I wasn't too stressed though but that's probably due to the valium I guess.",1
Sleep paralysis 6 times in one night,"I have never experienced more than one time in a night. It didn’t feel like normal sp, i could feel the sleep paralysis and i was struggling to move and finally sat up to realize I’m not in reality I’m in a dream. Even when i forced myself to sit up i wasn’t fully out of it i still couldn’t move and then i was back down on my bed still frozen trying to move and call out to my fiancé to wake up but i couldn’t move even my fingers. As soon as i forced myself awake and sat up , i would fall back asleep almost immediately because of my sleeping pills. (I take mirtazapine for sleep at night). And immediately I’m back in sleep paralysis exactly like last time. Same scenario. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a episode, has anyone else had this many in one night before?",1
"Just joined, been struggling with sever anxiety and ""SP"" or which after reading a couple stories below also False awakenings I believe.","So this being my first post I wanted to give some type of introduction to me. I am 21 and have been dealing with bad anxiety and depression since about 2010, this also happens to be the same year I watched my dad die next to me (story for another day). I am not a very good writer so my structure and punctuation will not be the best , but I recently almost ""kms"" so I want to get my stories out in case one day I fall victim to my own head.

My first story so I guess I should start with my first experience as a 13 yo back in late 2011 if I recall correctly. Some preface, I have always believed my house was ""haunted"" or I just call it occupied by lost souls. From strange experiences with my animals to first hand encounters or strange things happening which I will get to those in other subs like r/Paranormal. Anyway, I'm lying in bed asleep and all the sudden like my brain clicked on but I couldn't move nor see anything but I was sure my eyes were open. I heard what sounded like someone pacing back and forth on the concrete floor of my room, almost kinda  had a  slight slow drag to it like a bum leg being dragged. That was then muffled by loud whimpering like he was stand right next to in my face (I was top on the bunk bed). No idea how long it lasted but i eventually just woke up.

In the morning I asked my little brother (10 yo at the time) if he had heard anything last night, I didn't want to scare him so I wanted to be kind vague about it if he had said no because I knew he would ask why. He did not hear it or anything and when he asked why I told him i just heard a branch fall from the palm tree or something. I kept every experience to myself because I was not quite sure what to make of it. Over time they got different sometimes worse sometimes really uneventful. Thank your for taking the time to read my first story. I'm only really going to share my bad experiences considering the boring ones I'm just there kinda paralyzed for a moment then that's it. Have a good one,",1
Does anyone use a specific method to wake themselves up?,"I have experienced SP and lucid dreaming for years. It usually consists of me feeling like i have woken up already, and am trying to leave my bedroom. I can feel the carpet under my feet and the wood of the door handle on my hand as i turn it. Usually, suddenly, a feeling of unsafey suddenly kicks in and i realize i am dreaming, the mood changes.my body goes into panic mode. Recently when this happens, instead of freaking out about how i will get back into my body and waking up in a sweat, ive imput a method, of waking myself up.

In my dream, as soon as i feel unsafe, i go to the bathroom and turn the tap on. I wet my hand. When i do this, i am able to accept i am actually just asleep and it wakes me up.

Does anyone else do anything like this?",1
Sounds while completely aware after SP,"Just had one of those bad episodes where I wasn't even asleep as long as I know. Just a sudden hit on my body and after that I cannot ease my panic attacks. AllI can do is hear everything around me and a ""psst""-like sound is freaking me out while also annoying me. Maybe it's a small bug but I can't tell.

Also, nobody in my house seems to be aware of anything. Not even my dog so maybe I'm panicking in vain.",1
"Having a sleep paralysis inside a dream in wich I'm having SP. After that waking up to ""real"" SP.","It's been like two weeks, but I had that weird dream in which I've experienced a SP, I opened my mouth and tried to talk as usual, same with moving my fingers until I wake up. There was a zombie like shadow stepping trough the door making their way towards me. 

I woke up, finding myself in another SP, keeping my eyes close, feeling a need to cry. Don't remember much more of it except for:

SP question,"So i just had the weirdest case of sleep paralysis. i literally can’t tell if it actually was sleep paralysis, because my arm was over my eyes, but i was still “hallucinating”. 
i went numb, reached for my phone (i thought) and my hand left several tracers, i felt like i started to float from my bed. couldn’t move a single muscle (although trying really, really hard), saw these beautiful yellow and blue butterflies that coated my vision, i couldn’t see anything but. 
they then scattered into a black mist...

then saw a very vivid, scary (not coated in black), wrinkly figure with a huge grin while choking on my tongue and trying to call for my mom/breathe from my mouth at all... and just being unable to. 

but for some reason, it doesn’t feel like it actually just happened. but in the moment it did. 
has anyone else experienced this feeling AFTER sleep paralysis, like a fleeting feeling that it NEVER happened!? or that it was just a vivid dream? but i never wake up from dreams. i feel like i never fell asleep. 

i just couldn’t see my room since my eyes were covered. i thought i was in my closet?!

"Had my first sp?Don’t know what it was,can you guys help?","So I was watching video on 3G my WiFi wasn’t working so I got bored and fell asleep,then I was waking up every 2 min(not sp) then I slept again and I woke up I couldn’t open my eyes and then I felt some pain on my heart and I still couldn’t open my eyes and (was sleeping next to brother) all I heard was him panting like penny wise than I woke up/opened my eyes,was this a sp?",1
Steve Irwin,"A couple of weeks ago in SP, Steve Irwin was hanging on a vine that I have close to my bed throwing knives at my cat. I was trying to stop him by throwing pencils at him. It was just my hand jerking from the wrist in very stiff motions but it was the first time one of my body’s parts were able to move in sp. Really weird.",1
Weird vibration feeling during sleep,"Hey guys I’m wondering if anyone has ever experienced this. 

So a few weeks ago I was having trouble sleeping. I kept tossing and turning. I believe I finally got to sleep. I had what I think was a dream. I was in the same position I fell asleep in but I felt this intense vibration behind me and almost like someone was behind me. I got freaked out and began to pray. I wanted to scream and just as I was about to I woke up. I was very freaked out and have been sleeping with the tv on since this happened. 

This morning I had the same thing happen again. I was woken up to this vibration all along the back side of my body it got stronger and I started to pray in my sleep then I woke up. In the “ dream “ I was in the same position that I fell asleep in. 

Wondering if this has happened to anyone? In the past few weeks I have been meditating, attempting to do past life regressions and astral projection.  

Thank you",1
So recently...,"I just recently lost someone very close, they were murdered about three weeks ago. Since then I’ve recently been having sleep paralysis. It’s not every night but it has me terrified to sleep. It’s never happened to me before but last night was the worst. I kept getting out of it, then moving probably an inch and getting pulled back in, when I could move I was so unbelievably exhausted and my body was so heavy I could hardly move. I was scared to sleep after this. Any tips on how to stop doing this or is this normal after losing a loved one? I’m just terrified, the only tip someone said was “don’t open your eyes” which I have btw. I have not hallucinated, I’m just trying to scream out to my boyfriend to get me out of this.",1
Anyone?,"Hi, has anyone experienced having sleep paralysis and then the person you are sleeping with experienced it too? Because last night it happened to me again and to the person I was sleeping with right after I woke up.",1
Tormented,"SP torments me on a day to day basis and it’s driving me completely insane. Almost every night, especially during early mornings from 4-9. It’s always a presence in my room but I can’t ever see them. (I live alone) I feel my hair being played with, I feel hands all over me, I hear silent laughter and I’ll occasionally hear whispering real close to my ear which makes me jump out of bed. Just moments ago I woke up after feeling something blowing in my face. It’s always something new with this demon, I bet it’s going to start singing country roads next.",1

Trying to relax and fall back asleep back fired,"I’ve heard when you’re experiencing sleep paralysis you should just relax and fall back asleep, I tried that and it only became worse.  I got that intense tingly feeling going up and down my back and I started hearing this creepy music you’d hear in a music box in a horror movie, this went on for what felt like forever but was probably 30-60 seconds.  I guess it didn’t help that before the paralysis started, I was already having a creepy dream.  I feel like it was because of the extreme amount of stress I’ve been under this past couple of days.",1
Sleep Paralysis with the country road creature,"Long story short, I watch many creepypastas and everyone tells me they will get stuck in my head and hit me at the worst moment. I never believed them until last night. So I was in a dream where I saw a tunnel with blue lights and it was empty. I had a fast McLaren 570s in that dream and so I sped down that tunnel until my engine broke down. I decided to walk out of the tunnel and i saw a car speeding at me. It did a U turn before it reached me and yelled: ""WHAT IS THAT?!"". I looked back and saw the country road creature smiling at me. Then I was back in my room and heard my door opening. I saw the long white arms with claws in my room then I saw the face and then it charged at me and somewhat jumpscared me. However it dissapeared and what I did not know is that the dream was over. My heartbeat went up like no other time and I put my head against the wall and started having lot of questions in my head. ""Monsters ain't real, right?"" ""What if I go in my parents room?"" ""Has he ate my family and now I'm the only survivor?"". I was literally freaked out like I never was and then I started to think about cute and funny stuff that would calm me. I looked at the clock and realized the process of calming myself took around one hour. Then I went back to sleep.",1
I dreamt of sleep paralasis,"Okay, so in the middle of a dream i was sitting in front of a mirror and NOT looking at it.5 Seconds later IN THE DREAM i start breathing 3 times harder than the guy in outlast (which is really loud) that lasted for around 30 seconds.That happened 2 times more in the SAME dream.Does anyone know wht happened because this isnt a common sleep paralasis or is this even a split paralasis?

Edit:It was a lucid dream and i couldnt move too",1
Dark shadow on top of me,"Last night I had SP for the first time in a while, was pretty intense. I woke up at around 3 and I could see a dark shadow infront of me, it felt like it was sat on my tummy/legs (I sleep on my back). I sat up slighting and gasped for air trying to make a noise for what felt like around 10-20 seconds. It felt like it was sucking the air out of me (dementor from harry potter kinda thing). Then I managed to push myself up and it dissapeared. 

Feels like something out of a horror movie haha. Afterwards I had to tell myself it was just imagination, but I've never experienced that sort of thing before, something being on top of me. 

Anyways... sleep well all :')",1
Wanting To See Her Face,"Now back in the day like7 years ago I had my first sleep paralysis. It was a very intense feeling of unable to move from bed. Of knowing ""someone"" was keeping me still.

Even then I forced myself to rise from the bed, not wake up but atleast get free and during my first SP I saw the long haired girl dressed in white (which seems to be a common one) at the end of the bed as I rose up. Now I was still numb to really move well as she just ran away from the room and I woke up.

Ever since then I've been thinking about her from time to time and I've been wondering who she is.

So tonight I had my first proper sleep paralysis on my new apartment so I had no idea where she would be. Turns out she stands right next to me with her back towards me and looks at the floor with her black hair covering her face.

So tonight again I was able to fight my way through the paralysis, which feels like going through a static field of sorts.

I then with my body still numb grabbed the girl as fast as I could, holding her thightly and tried to brush her hair aside to see her, but my hands were just too numb and suddenly I was back laying on the bed in SP. But I broke through again this time failing to catch her arm and she got away and I woke up.

I am surpringly aware when sleep paralysis happens and always fight my way out of it and I'm drawn towards knowing who she is. I'm not particularly afraid of her or anything anymore, but I do know that during dreams you're not supposed to look at people who purposefully hide their faces nor should I look at mirrors.

But I'm just intriqued by who she is and why she does this to me. I'm not mad at her or angry nor am I hurt. I just kinda want to talk to her since she visits my dreams every now and again.

Should I see her face?",1
Something from the dark,"Hello there!
I have Had a lucid dream before when I was younger but this one I had last night really stuck with me. It was the first time I experienced sleep paralysis.  

So here it goes 🤷🏻‍♀️

The dream started with me entering my bedroom from my living room, I was trying to turn the light on in my closet so I can look for something. My partner was asleep and I could hear him snoring, my closet my darker than normal and the light wasn’t turning on. As I was trying to alert him to hands with very sharp claws come out from the closet and grab my arms. I fall backwards and land on my bed, I don’t see anything and I can’t speak. I’m trying my hardest to say something but worlds are not coming out. I still feel the hands on me and I start thinking to myself “this isn’t real” over and over again. What felt like an eternity, I eventually felt myself being pulled from sleep and the hands released me. 

I’ve never had a lucid dream like that, could any experience dreams care to elaborate what the heck those hands were or help me decipher the dream?",1
Has anyone here just accepted their SP?,"Hi, I’m that one guy who saw his naked father in sleep paralysis. I’m curious if anyone here knows how to identify sleep paralysis right when they wake in it. For me, it’s easy to know and it doesn’t really frighten me anymore. Just the other night, I awoke to a shadowy figure on top of my chest and it was strangling me. My thoughts were “Oh, alright. I’m just in sleep paralysis. Guess I’ll wait this one out.” Can anyone relate?",1
This morning I had SP about 4:30am,One trigger of having SP for me I realised is a broken sleep cycle when I'm not getting enough hours and waking up multiple times a night. I also noticed my last thought before entering SP had to do with DMT. I encountered an entity that felt like my cat next to me even though I let him out my room last night.,1
My sleep paralysis helped me to get out of it.,"I just woke up from it, but it was different from the last few times. It startet as a 'normal' dream. I was at a party at my father's house and joking around with one of my friends, carried him arround on my shoulders and such stuff. Then i was like: damn we forgot our pizza, and we went towards the driveway (him still on my shoulders). Suddenly I felt how my feat  got more and more heavy and I thought :fuck I'm drifting in sleep paralysis. Then I  felt how I was halfway in and half awake, I took al the strength I had and threw myself toward my girlfriend, stroking her, shaking her, trying to wake her up. Feeling how something startet to pull on my legs, overwhelmed by panic I tried to shout or scream I opened my mouth but no sound was coming from me. I tried more and more still feeling this pulling grab on my ankles I started to breath as loid as I could. At this moment my girlfriend startet moving, crawling towards me, finally sitting over me trying to wake me  up. Then se leaned over me and pressed her chest on mine. That was the moment I let go...
And woke up in bed. My girlfriend next to me sleeping peacefully like nothing had happened.

It felt so real, everything. I thought she woke me up..
But she didn't...",1

Turn SP into Lucid dreaming?,"Hey guys I'm new here. It's cool to see that there is a whole subreddit about this! I think people saw that SP documentary and now they look at us like a character from a horror movie. So it's nice to see others who go through this as well. 

I've had SP as log as I remember. I can get myself out of it as soon as I fall into it. But then I have to stay up for a couple hours or I go right back into it. 

I consider dreaming a ""hobby"" of mine. I'm really into what my dreams are and what they may mean. I've spent over ten years trying to perfect lucid dreaming but alas I've only done it 3 times. 

My question is, has anyone ever overcome the SP while it was happening and turned it into a lucid dream? Or has anyone noticed any connections between SP and astral projection? I'm a pretty spiritual person and I know the 'figures' come from somewhere inside of me.

After I figured that out I don't see figures anymore. But I float and spin a lot now which is even worse because of how disorienting it can be. 

However I still think we could be the lucky ones if we learn how to control SP and learn from it. My goal is ""Turn darkness into light and become one with that light.""

Anyways, does anyone know what I'm talking about and have any advice?",1
I finally found a (legit) solution!!,"Ever notice how you can always move your eyes during sleep paralysis but can't move anything else? Well, try moving them around super fast and it will pull you right out of that state. You just need to be intentional about it and think of it the same way as you would think about moving your hand. No idea why this is so effective but really it couldn't be easier.

I also find that it makes me feel much less anxious than when I know I have to twitch my finger which can be really disorienting and hard when my whole body doesn't feel connected.",1
is this sleep paralysis?,"I'm not sure if this counts as sleep paralysis or not but I've been wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or maybe knows what it is and possible causes of it.

When i was still in school the only way i could get there was if my dad drove me, but he would go to work super early so i'd get there at 7 AM when class started at 9, so it would give me some time to do whatever, i would usually spend the time face planted on a desk trying to make up for lost sleep hours or just sleep a little extra. this is the first time i remember it happening, i'd be completely sleeping but conscious of it, it felt like a weird dream where i couldn't move or force myself to wake up, but i could hear footsteps and muffled  talking, like someone was in the classroom with me, i'd hear someone who i thought was my teacher, my principal or the cleaning guy who wouldn't usually be there at that time, but there was never anyone there. when i finally got up none of the other students have appeared, only an hour had passed and nobody was there. but the most annoying/scary part of it wasn't hearing people, it was knowing i was sleeping but not being able to force myself to wake up, i'd tell myself ""just get up"" and try to burst the ""bubble"" open but nothing.

more recently I've been also dreaming about  forcing my eyes open but everything seems blurry and i feel dizzy and weak, i don't think i ever actually opened my eyes when it happened but it feels real enough.  sometimes i realize what's going on and just sit it out ""ok fine i'll just wake up soon i guess..."" but mostly i keep stressing out and trying to wake up and then shake when i'm finally awake. every time it happens it's the newest scariest moment of my life, until i'm finally up.

is this sleep paralysis? is it something else? can i do something to make this happen less frequently?  i also take really really long to fall asleep. every time i go to bed I usually wait until i'm extra tired before i actually go, if that matters. also considering cutting caffeine and seeing if that makes a difference.",1
I'm scare to sleep,I am very afraid to sleep because of the sleep paralysis I have gone through. Is like there's 2 times of sleep paralysis in one night. It happen frequently like 2 times a month. This causes me to feel scare to go to sleep.. is like it going to happen again if I sleep. What do I do.. I am really tired but I'm scare.,1

How to stop having sleep paralysis easy,"Hi Reddit folks, I created this post to help people tired of having trouble sleeping. I had this problem for 4 years every day when I was young.

**I dont gonna start explainin why this works, the only you need to know is that when u are on a paralysis u are desorientated, i found the fix of this problem when i was 16 years, after living this more than 3 times per night.**

1. **The first thing need is a piece of paper**
2. **Roll up the piece of paper**
3. **Now u need to put the paper on a very nervous body zone, i always use my feet fingers, if u  dont understand u can see this pic** [**https://prnt.sc/twgshe**](https://prnt.sc/twgshe) **u will put the piece of paper there.**
4. **Go to sleep! Enjoy! u will be free after this.**

**Edit:**

I just edit this to write a little part of my story with this.

Im 19 years having sleep paralysis since 12-14 years every night, how u can imagine i saw and feels a lot of stuff on this mind states sometimes more than 3 times per night ¡ **¿the reason?** i was sleeping on my brothers room in complete darkness causing big states of desorientation during the night.

So i started to find a solution and i found this one night for me. **This not suggestion! :**  when u get into paralysis u are on a big state of desorientation, to help ur mind dont get desorientated u can touch a very nervious part of your body to fix the problem of desorientation

&#x200B;

**Second edit:**

This technique is not suposed to be used every night, u can have dream paralysis every day cause the last night u have it and at the night the mind remember the sentation, with my method in one point u will forget that sensation and stop to having it at the night, helping a lot to stop having more paralysis.

Religious and supernatural beliefs v. evolution,"I'd like to know if demon hallucinations that accompany SP happen to people with absolutely zero religious or supernatural backgrounds?  So, did anyone here grow up as a naturalist, with no belief in the supernatural, in ghosts, in christian concepts of heaven and hell and demons, and still experienced demons in SP growing up? I'm curious how much effect religion has on that.

And if you fit this description, and you did see some weird monster/demons in your SP, as a kid, how did you interpret it?

I'm wondering if its an evolutionary adaptation in a way, if it's a deeply engrained primitive fear, like the fear of snakes, that we all carry from our ancestors.",1
My sleep paralysis demon,"So about 2 years ago we went on a schooltrip to the woods and the first 2 nights everything turned out well the 3 night was the scariest thing happend to me so i dont how late it was but i just woke at that time i dint even know demons really existed so when i waked up i couldnt move which i founded very weird then i look to my friend( i was laying sideways) and i saw a bump in the blanket so i knew he was laying there but then to my horror next to him it standed there(i dont know if sleep paralysis demons have genders) so anyway it just stood there and i guess it was about 2m tall, 6.5ft and it didnt came up to me it just stood there so i went back to sleep and never had sleep paralysis   also how do you get sleep paralysis or does it just happen randomly?",1
"Scary, but positive experience with SP","I have experienced sleep paralysis several times in my life, some times were scarier, other were pretty easy to overcome. Usually my SP behaves with hallucinations, seeing figures and shadows, feeling pressure on my chest, feeling intense panic and anxiety, and full or partial paralysis of the body. 

The first and scariest time I experienced SP was a few years ago, when I woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible feeling of panic, I was unable to move, I heard (better said imagined hearing) my bed creaking, and I felt a super heavy pressure on my chest, it was almost like someone was sitting on it. I also felt like there was someone in the room with me, the air felt heavy, and I was seeing shadows and figures on the wall. I remember I tried to cry and call for help, but I had no voice, I was unable to speak or even move my jaw. I could only move my tongue, but it didn't really help. It was really terrifying, and when I finally recovered my senses after a few minutes I cried and couldn't sleep for the rest of the night. I am the person to always try to find a logical explanation for things, but that experience was something far beyond my understanding, and I wasn't able to figure out what it was. Sure, I was familiar with nightmares and sleepwalking, but that physical powerlessness and the overwhelming panic were something new. 

It was only about a year after that when I learned what SP was, and I finally understood what happened. Since then, I have had more episodes, which weren't so bad as the first one, but still terrifying. Anyway, I was able to recover and overcome the stress it would give me.

Last night, at around 4 in the middle of the night, about an hour after I fell asleep, I suddenly started to feel like my bed was moving, it felt like an earthquake, and I tried to wake up, but couldn't. I was fully awake and conscious, but my eyes were closed and my body paralysed. Usually I sleep on my side or on my stomach, but at that moment I realised I was on my back, which happens very rarely, and from my experience SP happens especially when lying on the back. So I knew it was SP and was totally aware of it. I had my right hand on my forehead and tried to move it, I felt my body tensing up trying to move, but nothing was happening, I suddenly felt powerless and started to panic a bit. I wanted to open my eyes, but was scared I would see stuff, and decided it was best for my tranquility to keep them closed. I tried to also move my left hand, which was on the bed, but it felt numb and barely there. Then I tried to mumble to see if I have my voice, it didn't work, so then I just tried to calm down and breathe deeply. After about a minute, which actually felt like an hour, I was able to move my feet and then my body started to relax and I could finally move again. Then I just turned on my side, calmed my mind and went back to sleep. 

Why I consider it a positive experience is because I was able to control my anxiety, I was able to calm down and relax, until it passed. Usually the panic makes it worse for me and I start to feel like it's the end, but last night I was totally aware that this was going to pass and I would get back to normal soon. I am happy and relieved that I was able to manage it, and really hope for my future SP experiences to be as easy to overcome as this one was.",1
Sleep paralysis without paralysis?,"I’m typing this at 5am, all nervous cause wtf. I was completely asleep, all of a sudden woke up to the feeling of someone touching the sole of my foot. For a second I was like, “What is that?” Until I registered it was fingers. As soon as I thought that I pulled my foot away and touched my boyfriend beside me to see that he wasn’t the one doing it. I lay there for a bit, getting my nerves down before I grab my phone to use the flashlight, and there’s nobody there. 

Ok, one: this suddenly woke me up. Why would I be woken by sleep paralysis?
Two: I don’t remember having the “paralysis” at any point of this.
Three: I don’t remember ever having sleep paralysis before. Very vaguely I may remember that I had it once or twice as a kid, can’t really remember.

So I guess I don’t have a certain question but really would like to hear some thoughts on this?",1
The giant spiders are back,I’ve been having these problems since 2014 I wake up and see giant spiders crawling on walls or ceilings or something that’s not really there and I wake up screaming and running pretty embarrassing because it makes people I date think I’m crazy The spiders had stopped for a min and replaced with me being sleep and then losing my breathe and I jump up screaming and running every time last night I woke up and saw a giant brown spider crawling on the wall I didn’t scream and it disappeared out of thin air it’s embarrassing because now my four year old is asking me why am I screaming so loud and it’s nun thing there,1
Unsure if it was SP,"Hello, as you can tell I'm kinda frazzled by this at the moment. I've never had sp before but it was so so intense if it was. The reason why I'm unsure is because I cover my eyes with a blanket while I sleep so my eyes are closed but I also don't have the normal 'I just woke up from a bad dream' groggyness. It started like a semi normal dream but I went to pet my cat and he was just frozen in place like he was getting ready to bite me which he never does but my whole body was stuck in this feeling like I was vibrating. I felt my blankets on me, like the sticky heat from them, while I still had this feeling going on through my entire body but I still just couldn't move and I started panicking because I thought I could feel my cat's claws in my arm. I hadn't been asleep for long and since I have lost the vibrating feeling I feel like I'm going to be physically sick. Sorry if this is the wrong place, just trying to find my bearings.",1
Sleep paralysis made me religious (sorta),"I still remember my first time like it was yesterday. It happened one night in 6th grade. I was sleeping in my room with the lamp (on as one does when they are 12 and afraid of the dark). I remember waking up thinking that my mother had walked into my room and tried to call for her. Only for no words to come out of my mouth nor could I move to get up. With my eyes half open and heavily lids, the only thing I could see was the light from the lamp across the room and it felt like I was getting sucked into it. Panic immediately set in! I couldn’t move or scream and I didn’t even know if I was breathing. I thought “Oh shit IM GETTING ABDUCTED BY ALIENS!” You know those movies where kids get abducted from their rooms by a glowing hovercraft and the path of static looking light thing that leads to the space ship? My room felt exactly like that and I thought I was leaving earth. In my mind, I immediately willed my eyes shut and started chanting “IM A GOOD PERSON. IM A GOOD PERSON. ILL BE A BETTER PERSON. DON’T TAKE ME NOW.” Some may call this a prayer but if there was a higher divine being I hope they heard my message. And with my two brain cells, I was able to will my body awake. I woke up, grabbed my ipod touch (that was probs my most prized possession back then), and ran straight to my parents room crying. I didn’t tell them what happened, only that it was a nightmare, fearing that I was almost possessed or that aliens would come and get me. I def didn’t want them to think I was a demon child.

Now I’m in college and sp is still a relatively common occurrence. Reading wiki or asking my doc definitely did not help. And everytime sp hits I still chant “ILL BE A BETTER PERSON. IM TOO YOUNG” in my head. Either way science can’t cure sp and i eventually break from it after chanting so I guess it works. In conclusion, i hope y’all w/ sp are being decent human beings and live a long life cuz I swear i get a heart attack everytime this shit happens to me.",1
"URGENT HELP.... Blocked between sleep & awaken, flashing lights black and white like geometric shapes very profound and me in my mind repeating ''hysteria'' with a weird voice","This happened twice and it's freaking me the hell out of me. I think it's been those last two days. Notice that I have huge neuro symptoms with lyme disease, mcas, methylation issues etc... But nothing shows up on non contrasted mri... They didn't tested nervew anyway. Tonight I think I only slept one hour or so but at a point in a ''dream'' I was being chased by a binch of people. I was with other people but everytime we needed to stop making pauses and I was like heck guys we can't stop we can't stop they're gonna get us !!! Then more the time passes more we lose our members. We were first making rounds in a solid car then ended rushing in a marketplace etc. One of them actually ripped my scarf of me I remember looking him at the eyes a long time being angry, but U needed to move asap !! so jumped everywhere took the escalator and ended outside thenI said to them (my companions) to take water bottles with them there wasn't water in it but weird orange thing but I found 4+- glass water bottles took them but then saw the people left the store go search us outisde... So I jumped on the ground like my friends and that when the physical real life manifestation become too. I began to ''be aware in real life I think ?'"" and was blocked physically bit by bit my eyes saw closed very weird very very INTENSE black and white geometric shapes then me in my mind repeating the words ''hysteria hysteria hysteria'' with a very very very distorded voice. Somehow I know I needed, I NEEDED to wake up. If I didn't I think I would (idk if my consious mind of dreams feels that) but would have ended in the hospital being worse I think idk. It just... Deeply felt like my mind and body and the voice saying ''hysteria'' indeed had hysteria or idk what the hell that is ? Just it felt like it was being driving nuts, like it began to be crazy... I'm so afraid to go back ro sleep now but I need because of my symptoms.. Note that my symtpoms did worsen those past two days. Heck still haven't a doctor that wants to help me... Also note that I do a TON of the weirdest dreams every with no meaning at all. Just plain weird.",1
Does sleep paralysis open up a door to the unknown? (Proven ghost story),"About 10 years ago I stayed in a beautiful resort in Key West (The Banyan). It was originally built in the mid-1800s and originally served as housing. In the 1980s it was converted into a resort. I thought I would mention this to acknowledge how much history this location holds. 

Anyway, I stayed there when I was 20 in one of their large rooms with my then-boyfriend and his family. His parents and their friends each had bedrooms within this large room, but my boyfriend and I slept on the pullout couch. 

The last night we stayed there we were on the pullout bed watching Seinfeld after everyone had gone to bed. We were in a spooning position with me facing the TV next to the bed, and my boyfriends arm draped around me. I felt him dozing off (he starts twitching a lot) and I felt myself get pretty tired. Suddenly my whole body goes numb. My mind was still awake but my body was asleep. I know this because I could still see the Seinfeld episode and I could still look around the room. And I had been suffering from sleep paralysis for quite a few years already. 

I continue to look around the room and when my gaze returns to the TV I see that there is someone standing between the TV and the bed. Basically a yard away from me. It’s a little girl. Maybe about 8. She’s wearing 1800/early 1900 attire. A little blue dress with white stockings and Mary Jane shoes. Her hair was in curls with a blue ribbon. But her face was what scared me. It was pale; pale lips, pale eyes. And she had a blank expression. She was just looking down at me, staring. I shut my eyes and started hyperventilating. My deep breathing woke my boyfriend who started shaking me. Finally I snapped out of paralysis and she was gone. I dismissed it as a nightmare and went to sleep. 

Here’s where it gets interesting... fast forward 6 years. I got engaged to my then-boyfriend. My best friend planned my bachelorette in Key West. She chose The Banyan resort. When myself and my group of friends arrive, we make our way to our room. I see that we get closer and closer to the room where I had this “nightmare”. Before I knew it, we were in front of the room door. We were staying in that same room. 

I kept quiet and didn’t tell any of the girls what happened in there. I didn’t want to creep them out... that is until the final night we were there. I told them everything I just wrote above. My best friend decided to google the resorts history. Turns out the exact room we were staying in was haunted. And not just haunted by anyone, it was haunted by the ghost of a little girl. 

The call her the “chocolate ghost” because she is notorious for stealing chocolates from housekeeping (the type they leave on top of pillows). 

So this confirmed that I indeed saw a ghost and was not dreaming. But does it also confirm something else? Does it maybe confirm that sleep paralysis opens up a type of door to the other world? Because in all my “episodes” I’m always hearing and seeing things that “are not there”. Makes me wonder...

Anyone else believe this?",1
Anyone else?,Have you ever been bit during sleep paralysis? This shit HURT a slow painful bite. Almost couldn’t handle it.,1
Is it everything alright? Help,"I’ve experienced sleep paralysis since i was 14, i’m 17 now. First one with an allucination.
 But over the past 3 years it went worse.
Sleep paralysis have become a daily thing on my routine i go through it literally every day and just when i think i know all the tricks, i experience something new and totally shit my pants.
Over the past years when i try to nap i suffer from it. I discovered the patron and it’s actually taking a nap what causes it, but i just want to take a fucking nap. It happens like three times in a row before i actually fall asleep.
I don’t necessarily feel presence of demons or spirits but i can’t move, or talk, scream, only see whats happening live right there. 
I began to experience trembling, teeth clinching, that feeling when you roll your eyes? Well that same feeling only it’s like they got stuck there. Not gonna lie, feels like being exorcised or having a seizure. Especially the teeth and eyes part.
I try to move but it only causes more anxiousness and tried to don’t fight it but feel like I’m gonna get stuck there forever and kinda loose myself in that limbo. I wake up dizzy and with heart palpitations, wanting to throw up. 
It just really mess my sleep and I’m scared to sleep. 
Yesterday i was having a nap on the couch and my mother and grandma were watching tv in the table in front on me. I knew what was gonna happen and said “if i fell sleep, look at me” i wanted to prove them what it’s wrong but i wished they would pay me attention. I later had 3 paralysis, in front of them.
Maybe all the sensations and movements that i feel i do they don’t happen in real live life and my brain is messing up with me.
I want to know your story and if anybody felt that way, how do you snap out of it, also if anyone were able to see a psychologist or any medical professional that could help. I don’t know what to do nobody takes me seriously.
Hope y’all have a great day, just joined in and feel more comfortable!",1
I think I just had SP,"I’ve never had this happen before and I’m not sure if it actually was. Hoping for some clarification and advice to make it not happen.

I was asleep,  I heard **\*knock, knock, knock \*** from the right side of my bed it woke me. I heard the same knocking coming from the left side of my bed. I told myself it was in my head but i felt uneasy. I got up, used the bathroom and got a glass of water and placed it on my nightstand. 

When I got back into bed I felt scared like **genuine fear**, i tried to ignore it and go to sleep. I started to hear some muttering and whoosh i felt like i was **falling and spinning** and it didn’t stop. I was trying to move but I could only open my eyes and look around me. I felt like something was there and it wanted to hurt me. I wanted to turn on my bedside table lamp so badly, but I couldn’t move and felt like I was spinning out of control. My television turned on and started playing something that was random but I knew it wasn’t really on I just felt that it wasn’t real. 

I finally managed after I don’t know how long to jolt up. I was scared I checked my phone for the time and it was only 3:40AM. I decided it was okay to go back to sleep after making sure nothing was in my room trying to hurt me. As soon as I decided to go back to sleep **I heard the muttering** and felt that **falling feeling happen on the right side of my body** and I forced my self up and I have been up since. 

I’m really glad I didn’t see anything than a weird television program that didn’t exist. Any thoughts on this?",1
Can my dog tell when I have Sleep Paralysis?,"Hi everyone, this is actually my first post to Reddit after being a lurker for about a year so forgive me for formatting or anything else lol.

I have generalized anxiety disorder and with that comes a lot of nightmares and the occasional SP. Usually you get SP waking up or falling asleep, but I get it after being awake already. 

After waking up, I'm able to move and open my eyes normally but then I'll get a weird feeling. It's hard to explain it, but as soon as I start to feel it, I'll start moving around to advoid it. A lot of the time it does work and I'm able to get up for the day or, after a few minutes of winding down, able to fall back to sleep normally. 

If I can't advoid it, I will feel an overwhelming sense of tiredness and fall to SP. When it happens, I usually just hear static. sometimes I'll hear a girl whispering and/ or screaming. I used to think it was this little girl's spirit that's been attached to me messing with me, but I've come to realize that it's most likely my brain pin pointing the sound hallucination and putting a face to the voice (if that makes sense lol).

So, when I have SP, I'm usually laying on my side. After the paralysis kicks in, I'll start to shake/ tremble and I'll curl into a ball. With that, I also feel like I'm on the drop part if a huge rollercoaster, but instead of it being in my stomach it's my entire body. If I'm able to open my eyes, I'll see a bunch if green and orange flashing lights. I think one time I saw a green and orange palm tree on my ceiling.

I've read that the shaking, trembling and curling into a ball is just apart of the hallucination and it's my brain tricking me into the sensation and its not actually happening. If this is true then how come my dog will come and lay on me? She's roughly 50 pounds, so her laying on me helps me wake up faster. 

Can she sense what's happening while shes asleep herself? Before I got her, I got SP almost every night. Now I can go a year with having it just maybe two or three times. I like to think of her as my protector in real life and in dream land lol (shes an American Pitbull Terrier)

I'm currently dog sitting and I was able to bring her with me. The couch is L shaped and I'm sleeping on the lounger,  shes beside me with a cup holder between us instead of the normal way we sleep: our backs pressed together. (Trust me, she's tried. Just no room lol)

I had sleep paralysis this morning and it felt like it lasted forever. The falling sensation and trembling for maybe 7 times in a row (getting it, waking up and then having it happen all over again) before I was actually able to wake up. When I did wake up, she was staring at me. I do remember attempting to call her name but as you know with SP, it probably came out as a weird sound instead. My dog is pretty fearless so she can sleep through fireworks and thunderstorms without a flinch, so I don't think me making a weird grunt would've woke her up.

Could she sense when I'm having sleep paralysis and tries to wake me up?",1
One method to slip out of sleep paralysis,"Hey folks, I’m new to reddit but not new to sleep paralysis and thought I’d make a post about how I overcame my sleep paralysis (which I had badly for 5 years).

Obviously this won’t work for everyone and to truly overcome sleep paralysis you’ll need to identify the root cause and circumstance for your own experience.

For me, physically, the best thing to do wasn’t to ‘fight’ the paralysis. I think the automatic instinct is to try to sit up or push against the weight against you. I found this to be ineffective. For me, if I rocked side to side enough times, I could wake myself up and slip from the grip. If you can imagine you’re caught in a rip, similar to one in an ocean, the trick isn’t to fight the current but to slip away from it and swim sideways. Similarly, by rocking or trying to move to the side, I was more able to slip from the physical sensation or wake myself up fully. Don’t look ahead, don’t move up or towards, keep your eyes to the side and ease out of it. 

In terms of mental fortitude or emotional capacity - I found when I was scared, shocked, frightened or angry, these things just made the experience worse. Resignation also didn’t help. What seemed to work for me were a few things: if I teased, laughed at, belittle or downplayed the severity of what was happening, it had less of a grip on me. For example, if I saw a creature sitting on my chest, I’d taunt it with thoughts like: is that the best you got? You couldn’t scare a child with that face. Ohh soo spooky, look at me, I’m a scary demon. I’m not scared by you, I’m sorry but you’re simply not that scary, you’re gonna have to try a lot harder. That seemed to do the trick. The more confident I was, the less it occurred or it lessened the duration of the episode. 

Another trick was to look at what was happening in my life. For example, I had a particularly bad burst when I had a bad breakup with a boyfriend and I’d always find it was him on me or in my dreams. I had to muster the courage to talk to him and resolve our issues and once I did, the paralysis stopped. So if you have any outstanding or unresolved issue - it might be worth acknowledging them, and if you’re not in a safe place where you can confront those issues, you’ll need the support of a therapist to talk it out and resolve internally.

That’s about it - if you have any questions, let me know!",1
probably a demon in love w me,"One morning I had just woken up and I was laying in my mom’s bed, (I slept in there alone) and I couldn’t move or anything. I heard someone say my name and it sounded like it was said right in my ear, I ended up turning around bc I was on my stomach or back and nobody was there. That’s the creepiest experience I’ve had with it.",1
No Fear During Paralysis,"I’ve experienced SP all my life as far back as I can remember. I’ve experienced it so long I have rarely had a terrifying experience while it happens. There are exceptions but for the most part I’ve just found it interesting. Last night was an exceptional experience. Instead of trying to get out of it, I embraced it. I was able to get out of my bed and walk through my walls. It ended with me flying above my house.
I’ve often had dreams of mediocre flying but last night I truly flew. 
Does anyone else have positive experiences during sleep paralysis? Has anyone else found a way to control their fear and embrace the lucid nature of the dream?",1
Did we have a joint sleep paralysis dream?,"A few years back I had a very scary and confusing sleep paralysis dream that I could never forget.

In my dream I found myself in a big, dark house along with maybe 3 or 4 other people. We all were very confused and asking each other what was happening and where they were at. Now I truly feel like I KNEW these people, but their faces weren't familiar. In my dreams, faces frequently change when I talk to them, but the people in this dream never changed once. I could feel that they were real people and not just another character in my dream. It was as if we were all connected somehow in some way.
In the midst of our confusion, it was like all of our fight or flights were triggered at once. I immediately felt fear and like I had to run. I knew this same feeling was shared with the others bc i remember someone telling me we have to run and hide. I distinctly remember one saying ""She's coming, i can feel her.. she's coming."" Almost all of us seemed to know who ""she"" was (our sleep paralysis demon possibly?). Another person said that we can't leave the grounds of the house, so climbing out of windows or going through the front door wasn't a choice. We all scattered, but i remember one person following behind me to the backyard. Eventually we split and I attempted to climb the fence, but ""she"" got me and threw me down to the ground before I could get a foot over the fence. She was standing over me and holding me by the throat, and when I woke up in a sleep paralysis state, she was still standing over me and choking me.
I remember her words so clearly. ""You can never forget me. And if you try, i will come back and make you remember."" Obviously, I never dared to forget ever since. But how could I?
Im not sure if this was a shared sleep paralysis dream with other people, but I'm putting this out there to see if anyone has had this kind of dream and heard the same things i did. This dream was a few years ago so what the other dreamers might have said could be slightly different, but that's the gist of it.",1
Triple Sleep Paralysis?,"Last night I had one of the most terrifying experiences of my life but Im still pretty confused about what actually happened. I clearly remember 3 separate episodes of sleep paralysis that all happened within like 5 hours and I didnt know that this was even possible. I would have a very vivid nightmare for a period of time and then it would slowly fade into a haze and I would become paralyzed and eventually jolt awake for a second, only to fall back asleep a few seconds later and wake up in another nightmare that was a completely different reality each time until I finally woke up for real. Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this?",1
Does this count as sp?,So i think i am possessed because once or twice a month I believe. i have this weird sleep paralysis experience nothing demonic or scary appears but for some reason i can move around but like very slowly and float around my room and i just hear ringing and i just think really hard that i wanna go back to my body and i wake up? Idk if this is sp i just joined this sub reddit so someone pls explain this,1
I have extremely graphic and vivid hallucinations when I’m experiencing SP,"So just as the title says, my hallucinations are extremely graphic. I’m not even sure how my mind can conjure up some of the stuff. 

I will note, they have only become graphic after a traumatic event I went through 4 years ago. Yet none of my SP consists of the traumatic event or seems to be related. 

I’ve been told to stay calm during SP, but I don’t recall ever being aware that I’m actually in SP. I become severely paranoid although sometimes I manage to close my eyes which helps. Although a couple times I tried that tactic and when I closed my eyes I found that my eyelids were ‘see through’ so I had no choice but to see these horrible things. 

Some of the things I see (without getting too graphic) are 
-monsters of any sort: gargoyles, horned devil looking things, melted looking monsters. 

-My loved ones being harmed in the most horrific ways. 

-being dismembered slowly. 

-shadow figures

All the while not being able to move or scream. 

I can also be dreaming and something will trigger me in my dream to panic severely enough to where I lose control of my body and wake up in SP. I always hear a scream in my dream, not mine, when my SP starts in this way. It’s a woman screaming. 

I get SP maybe, on average, 3 times a month. I eat healthy, sleep regularly, drink lots of water, etc. 

Any advice on how to not have SP as much or change the graphic nature of it?",1
The Irony,I got the next 3 days off. Been up since 3a.m. and its currently 524pm my time. Im staying home and watching Freddy Kruger movies and relaxing. Im super tired. Have been drinking hahaha. And i have Sleep paralysis. DREAMS ARE MADE OF THESE!,1
Befriending my Sleep paralysis demons,Hear me out imma try and just say whatsup with them and chill with them ask em questions and stuff this might work they only hurt when u think they can which increases the chance of that happening wish me luck also any tips on this?,1
It’s been years since I’ve had SP until 2 nights ago...,"I think I just need to get this dream/SP off my chest..

I was having a hard time sleeping in the first place, last time I had noticed the time on my phone was about 2:10 AM
I fell asleep sometime after that and had a recurring nightmare. 
Very simple, I was in my new apartment with a girl I went to middle school with, it was very dark in the house and we were on the middle floor. We could hear the sound of someone coming into the downstairs and she went to go check it out, I tried to follow her and would freeze and literally couldn’t move. 
This is where the dream would stop and start over again. 
I never noted what we were doing, it just always started with us being in my dark apartment, the sound of someone intruding the house and her going to make sure everything was okay and me freezing with fear unable to find out what was downstairs.
It felt like it had cycled through this so many times until it got to the point in one cycle she had gone downstairs to see who was in the apartment and I was frozen with fear unable to move like all the other times and then I heard something up on the third floor(loft style) still unable to move I shifted my eyes up the stairs to see a shadowed figure coming down the stairs. 
There was an intruder upstairs coming for me, now alone as the girl I was with in my dream was downstairs. I felt so much panic I tried moving, yelling and screaming. It got closer and closer to me, I don’t know if it was my partner waking me up because I was actually screaming in real life or if I had woken myself up by screaming. 

I was apparently talking in my sleep, repeating my partners name over and over again as if I was asking him to wake me up. 

It had felt like I had been sleeping for most of the night and when I looked it was only 3:19 so at max an hour of sleep. 
It was just such a strange and different experience to when I use to have SP, it’s been at least 6 years since I’ve had SP. I had never been in a dream it was always like I had already woken up in my bed and would feel fear that there was something behind a door and would panic but not be able to move, speak, I could hardly turn my head as if someone was forcing me to stare at the door I feared what was behind. 

It was just such a strange experience and I had such a hard time shaking it off. It hasn’t happened again and I have no idea what sparked it. Because I use to experience SP so frequently I know it’s nothing to be scared of but boy is it hard to remember that when you’re in it.",1
How to experience so,Ok so I really want to experience so bad because I’ve NEVER had an experience. I get lucky if I even have a nightmare more than once a year and most people would thunk that’s lucky but I feel drawn to the paranormal but I never experience it. People say it’s scary and I really want to see how it feels but I’ve tried to experience it. I watched videos on how to make it happen and nothing ever works. I am really bored and nothing weird or scary had EVER happens to me and I really want to experience sleep paralysis. So if you know how to experience sleep paralysis PLEASE let me know how and how to control it because I don’t want a damn ugly creature trying to scare me with it’s uglyness. Also I feel I’m pretty good and not getting scared because of ugly ass looking things or scary looking things only jump scares make me jump but it doesn’t scare me so PLEASE leave your tips for me.,1
Has anyone had sleep paralysis within a dream?,"Has anyone had sleep paralysis within a dream? I experienced it first In my bed and focused on powering through to become lucid and I went into a dream state but instead of becoming lucid the symptoms followed me into my dream and I could hear all the usuall sounds and the force’s that act on my body when experiencing SP, however I was in a completely different house dream of my ex and her mum. It was quite the somthing.",1
Another episode this morning. Felt a hand gently rubbing my shoulder from behind.,"My episodes usually don't involve traditional paralysis, just the hallucinations as I'm coming out of sleep. 8/10 times I can move on command, or at least after building myself up to doing so with a deep breath. And once I do move I fully wake up, and the feelings stop.

As mentioned in another post, I rarely see anything, because I'm usually waking up at 11 am when my room is already fairly lit. It's harder for the mind to manipulate shadows and lack of sight the brighter your bedroom is. Bulk of my hallucinations are touch. And because I sleep on my side, it's always from my blindspot, behind me.",1
"All I heard was ""Eeeevil... eeevil... eevil.""","I was sleeping on the couch at my brother's house and his roommate got home at like 8 am after being out all night. I had an eye mask on so didn't look but I woke up to the sound of him opening the front door into the living room where I was sleeping. I then heard a voice as clear as day say ""Eeeevil... eeevil... eevil..."" what sounded like right outside the front door or by the front window--but NOT in a creepy way. It was as if someone was joking around and doing a really obviously bad job of being creepy. I assumed it was a friend of the roommate who had come home with him and went back to sleep. I laughingly asked him who it was later and he had no idea what I was talking about. He insisted that he had come home alone after staying at his friend's place and had neither heard nor made any noise. I asked all of the other roommates and some of them had heard him come home but no one else heard the voice. I asked him again to make sure he wasn't just messing with me and he swears he doesn't know what I'm talking about. We don't really have the kind of relationship where he'd be messing with me like that either. After discussing it with my brother, the only plausible idea we could come up with was that it may have been auditory sleep paralysis/hallucinations since I was awoken out of a deep sleep before it happened. The thing is, I didn't experience any feelings of being paralyzed per se, though I didn't partucularly try to move either. I also wasn't scared which seems to be common with most experiences (I think?). Lastly, I've never had sleep paralysis before this. 

What do you think the voice was?",1
I’m really scared,"I have never had SP once in my life but for the last two weeks it happens at least thrice a week. I’m up right now at 3am because it just happened and I’m too afraid to sleep now. Anyone has similar experiences with mine? About a month ago, I realised I started having looped nightmares, it plays over and over again. Then it got worse and my looped nightmares started having different layers - for instance, layer one’s nightmare looped by itself, when it completes, layer two’s start and layer two’s is worse than the first, the more layers I get (thus far, max I had was 5), the closer to waking up I became/realising I am in a dream; I can’t wake up in real life until I have woken up from each layer, it is as suckish as it sounds :(. And now, for the last two weeks, SP has been added to the layer looped nightmares and I’m not sure why things got so bad. I’m afraid of sleeping now, it’s wildly uncomfortable knowing I’m awake but can’t move and when I do try, it feels like pins and needles everywhere. I manage to break out of it by trying to squeeze my tongue between my teeth and biting down as hard as I can. :( any comment will be appreciated!!",1
Realistic demonic dream??,"Okay so I’m not sure it was sleep paralysis cause it felt so real or that’s the whole point?? last night I fell asleep around 9:30ish pm. I kept waking up throughout the night but I was in and out of sleep. I remember waking up around 2-3am at first I woke up thinking I was smelling something burning. It smelled like if wood and plastic was burning. I brushed off after sniffing the air for a couple minutes and I no longer could smell that scent. I fell back to sleep Then I heard my window opening and someone or thing crept through my room.. and whatever it was had something plastic with it. So I could hear the plastic moving with the steps. I was have a mini panic attack, I didn’t want to open my eyes or move, my heart was racing. The whole time I was thinking I’ll give it a couple minutes and I’ll turn over and grab my phone and double press the power button so the police can be called. I kept trying to listen where the thing could’ve gone in my house or if it tried to hurt any of my family members. And before you know I fell back to sleep. This morning I woke up.. obviously but I saw nothing missing my house. Later on today I will ask my parents if they heard anything last night.. this really bothers me it felt so real but I’ll be dumbfounded if it was all just a dream. My sister thinks since I’m trying to get close to God it’s a demonic thing that is trying to stop me.. I do believe in the paranormal but I had other dreams that something is trying to tell me things.",1
Today I died.,"Im not sure how to start this since Im in this sub for the first time in my life and also only had SP only a couple of times. But this one was different and thats why Im here, writing it down and still trying to comprehend what did even happen to me. Yesterday I got drunk with a couple of friends I havent seen for a year, had some pretty good time. I woke up at around 4am which is a classic as far as my hangover goes, grabbed some (a lot of) water, had a pretty quick breakfast - scrambled eggs with a baguette and blue cheese. I was watching youtube for maybe half an hour and went straight to bed, trying to fall asleep because I was craving for some more rest. So I fell asleep, had som pretty nice dreams actually, I remember I was jump diving in a very nice, sunny location. That was precisely before I was put in what Im almost convinced was the worst pain I have ever felt, both physicall and mentally. It started pretty normally, as soon as I “opened” my eyes I immediately realized that I was having SP. Now keep in mind that I dont know a whole lot about SP so Im not even sure which of these body/mind activities were happening in my sleep or in actual reality. I also concider myself to be a strong person as far as psychic goes even though Im not sure if this is the right way to put it and hope it doesnt sound egoistic either. Basically I started with what I thought was the best approach to stop the SP as soon as possible. I started trying to move my hands but every material I thought I touched felt exactly the same so I knew I wasnt actually moving. Then I slowly started to move my fingers, both on hands and the legs but I was convinced it wasnt doing anything. My next and final step I could think of was just to stay calm and try to fall asleep again, then wake up. Time was passing extremely slow and I wasnt falling asleep so I decided to play with it. Since I know SP often if not always contains some kind of hallucination/s and my dream didnt have any (well, except that I was awake) I decided to create my own. At first I “woke up” in my room, same as with the previous SPs except this time I knew right away that something was off. Previously it was basically indistinguishable from my real room, this time it felt.. assumed. The layout of my room was the same and the furniture stayed but it wasnt so vivid. Also a blindingly aggressive source of white light was burtsing through my windows. Now here comes the part where my imagination started working. I subconsciously changed that awful light to a beautiful meadow scenery, I could hear that kind of nice, natural sounds like when you are taking a walking through the forest. I felt the warmth of summer sun on my skin and felt almost euphoric. Then, for the sake of being me I decided that it was a time for experiment. I remember me thinking that if I could make it this nice, if I could also turn it well.. bad. And I did. I started very cautiously changing the scene to the darker one, I thought if I could imagine some kind of silhoutte standing in door like from a horror movie. In case you havent guessed it, this is where it went downhill. When I saw the silhouette I instantly thought “Ok, I can do this but the meadow was a lot nicer, now make it dissapear”. Closed my eyes, was ready to be on that beautiful meadow again but that wasnt really what happened. The scenery was now what I concidered to be a very twisted, dark mix of both “worlds” Ive imagined. I knew I had to wake up at that point because it was only getting worse but then I felt something I have never felt before. I completely lost control and it felt almost like my own concious attacked me for testing it. The silhouette was still in the door, windows were swapping between the meadow scenery and that blinding light, all the colors of my room went very cold and started fading away and I started to feel extreme pain mixed with adrenaline in all parts of my body. That I thought I could handle but what I certainly couldnt handle was what comes now. I had a literal talk with my concious, convincing me that this is how schizophrenic people percieve reality (mental illnes is probably my only real fear so you can probably only imagine how I felt) and was asking me if I like it that way and if we should keep it like that. I couldnt react to it in any way. When I thought that this just cant be any worse I started choking. Now I knew this was all the SP (still didnt make it a single bit less bearable) but the choking was my main concern at this point. It felt so real that even though I knew that the worst thing to do when you are having SP is to start fighting it like trying to move around and aggresively wake up but when you think you are going to die you are not really thinking about that. I wanted to yell so much that I cant even describe it, I knew I couldnt so I started smashing my hands around me histerically, hoping that my neighbours would hear something and will try to save me. I was trying to create as much noise as I could but I knew I wasnt doing any. I swear to god that I could feel leaving my mind and my body. I was convinced that there was nothing more to do so.. I just let go. I relaxed my body even though I was choking, exactly like when you are drowning and your lungs fill with water. I was staring at my ceiling with no breath left and I was so reconciled with me dying that I think I even welcomed it at some point. At the end all I saw was.. nothing. Pure darkness with no sound and feel and only thing I could think about was a girl that I broke up with half year ago. This is the part that I think I wont be able to explain properly. This feeling it was.. the most peaceful thing Ive ever experienced. My body was left in my room and I felt like I became a part of that darkness that was surrounding me. Nothing and everything at once. There was nothing, not even me or my feelings and the only thing that stayed was my conscious. I saw the girl I mentioned before with a beautiful big smile, extremely vividly, just floating around the darkness I essentially became and the last thing that happened with me was this sheer warmth and eternal peace I felt when I was confident that I was on the edge of death knowing that I had nothing to worry about, anymore. I only asked  myself: “Is this it, is this how it ends?”. (which I only now as Im writing it realized that this were the last words I used when we were breaking up with the girl)

After saying this, I instantly woke up. I immediately realized that nothing of what I have experienced has really happened and the reality has hit me like a ton of bricks. My eyes were full of tears, I started gasping for the air even tho I knew I could breathe all the time just fine because if I couldnt I probably wouldnt be writing down all of this now. I was in complete shock for good couple of minutes which was again something Ive never experienced before.

So to sum it up.. I seriously hope I didnt offend anyone suffering with mental illness with me comparing my experience in SP with schizophrenia. I also hope that it didnt have some kind of romantic or spiritual turn to the end of it. I also realize that this was all just in my head, drinking previously also may have helped to make the SP even worse. And lastly I would like to thank you for reading through all this .",1
Is this sp?,Hello guys.. this is my first ever post so I’m not sure how to approach this?? Anyways.. My brother had a nightmare and I’m not sure if it’s sleep paralysis or not. He said he felt like he couldn’t move and he was calling out to my mom and dad but he wasn’t able to speak or be heard. He also said that it happened twice in 1 night and on the 2nd time he heard someone say “stop struggling” and felt like he was being pushed down. He said he woke up because he broke its fingers and it let go of him? Any information helps😞,1
SP feels like it’s bleeding into my reality because I’ve been having it so often,"I’m in a place in my life where i’m very stressed by certain mental conditions and that’s probably making my SP worse, but lately i’ve been having SP dreams that are so intense and vivid and they’re happening so often (almost every other night at this point) that I don’t have time to recover from the last one. It feels like I’m seeing the same things in my waking hours and get the same painful/repulsive tingly feeling in my skin as when my SP demon gets close to me. I get enough sleep (slept 8 hours last night and had two SP dreams back to back), but i’m just worried when I wake up from it and it still affects me throughout my day.",1
"never had sp, but i might’ve just had it from a dream?","just had the most intense dream nap thing that  might’ve been sleep paralysis? it was a series of small naps where every now and then I’d become aware and kinda wake up but  then things started to get weird in the dream (like short bits of life were happening but only for like 2m then it’d clip to another and i got overwhelmed) so i wanted to get up. usually if i am like “oh this is weird like a dream i want out” then that wakes me up but this time it felt like i was stuck in the dream world and  i was trying to move my physical body but all the muscles were really tights and each muscle or tendon felt like felt like trying to stretch a balloon if that makes sense? and i rolled off the bed and tried so hard to get up but my body/brain wasn’t letting me and there was someone in the room with me and they were like “you can’t get out” but i kept trying and pushing and giving all my strength to stand up from the weird squat position i was in. eventually i stood up , but then i realized that that didn’t even happen. like all the movement didn’t actually happen, i had been in the dream the whole time. that whole ending part was like in black and white and it felt like I had some sort of clouded vision, like when you stand up and blood rushes to your head? and i got a bunch of those blood rush sensations throughout the thing. but anyways when i woke up  my whole body was sore and tired, especially my back, and i was kind of out of breath and i didn’t know what was real and what wasn’t, and i sat up and was super confused with what happened and how easy it was to move again. it may have been just a weird dream but it felt like something more. the entire waking up part of it felt like some one or thing was trying to get me. maybe a message?  and before the big nap i had a series of small attempted naps and time went really slow between those. like i had music playing and was ready to doze off but i would kinda doze off and wake and see that only 6 minutes had passed, and i thought it was like an hour. that happened at least 3 times before the weird stuff. i am thoroughly confused and kinda shaken by this all",1
Who did I meet? Where was I?,"Hi all! So I’ve been trying to astral project for a little while now. After a night of mediating for several hours I decided I would go to sleep. I ended up getting sleep paralysis, which I get fairly often. But This time it was different. Normally I’m in my room and often time I see things that are scary. This time I saw a woman she was very very beautiful, and I was standing in a courtyard with lots of stone structures. She said something to me but I can’t remember what. We began floating upward and spinning around each other, it felt amazing, the best feeling I’ve ever had. And then out of nowhere I realized it was sleep paralysis and everything went black. Then it felt like I sat up out of my body and then snapped back down. Then there was a weird image of white swirls imprinted in my vision until I was able to move again. I’ve been shook all day. I want to meet this woman again. Anyone know what happened?",1
Sleep Paralysis; consequences of sex.,"Female, late twenties. Spent 3 days on a birthday bender, playing party monster amongst a group of 10. I made it my focus to keep everyone happy and going like a bunch of spinning tops. I’ve always been able to infect others with my energy but I only let myself do this when I’m drunk. It’s also easiest then to let my guard down. But it’s also against my better judgement because it feels like I’m intruding on that persons will. As a teenager I used to ask myself if it was a form of rape when I did it in bed with men or women. Im only adding this to the story because I wonder if it’s relevant. 

What happened: On the final night i had wanted to walk home 5 minutes but my friends insisted on dropping me off in their taxi. I had felt pretty clear headed. Drunk, warm, happy but contemplative and i really wanted to just enjoy the stars and walk a block through the park. I felt like i just wanted my body and energy to myself rather than being crammed into the back seat of a loud taxi. And to enjoy myself. There are moments after partying, late at night where everything goes silent and it feels like you’re in your own music video. The sky is sparkly and you can watch everyone around you living in their own little worlds. 

Either way, i took their taxi. Walked into my apartment, fell into my bed and i was out cold. 

I woke up at 3-4 from a dream where i saw myself in my bed and someone was on top of me having some sort of sex with me. I wasn’t pinned down, i could “move” but it was heavy. I could feel the weight of it on me. It was like sex but it wasn’t clearly touching me and there was no penetration. But more like wandering hands over me and inside of me. I started enjoying myself, i even made it a point to welcome the sensations and “have sex back”. It felt like everything was melting together. Like when you have sex with someone you care about and start melding together. As soon as i started to orgasm i realised something was really wrong. Like i shouldn’t be giving this person my orgasm? Or that part of me? 

SUDDENLY it was off of me. Standing by my bedside. It was dark like a shadow. Endless blackness. But human like or manlike? With spindly arms. Long hair. Some sort of drawings or symbols all over its body. Concave bone chest. It wasn’t huge or towering. It wouldn’t let me lift up from the bed and was holding me down without physically touching me. I could see myself naked in bed and it right near the top of my head watching me. Almost as if it was amused and calm. I didn’t feel like it wanted to hurt me but it didn’t want to let me go even though i was praying and demanding it would. But i couldn't speak. Just lash out with my thoughts.

I woke up and fell back into fitful sleep and went back to paralysis two more times. This happens often. Back to back paralysis. It just felt like whatever was going on wouldn’t let me be. 

Eventually i got up and got water, and turned all my bedroom lights back on and fell asleep. 


My questions are: Is this a common visitor from my description. What are the consequences of me having “sex” with it or orgasming. Are there other things that can be done with those entities or are they purely there for feed and leave?",1
A super real life dream(but not lucid)before entering to stage of SP.,"I have frequent SP until the previous year which SP just stopped happening , but recently SP was back and the same goes to for the nap in the afternoon today.I know and I am aware of it when SP is about to happen,the feels,the sounds,everything right before SP ,I am familiar with it.So SP happened, and this time I just ignore it and continued to sleep. I dreamt about a badass character doing some crazy badass sh*t and I'm super excited ,just like watching a movie, and then I just realized I was reacting to it in my dream , as well as in real life , by grinning while watching the scene.The sleep paralysis is still there, but right after dreaming abiut that scene,I felt like some sort of energy just swooped in my ear and SP is gone and I woke up.

I wanna experience SP again as I wanna try lucid dream,so I just continued to sleep right after SP happened(which is more likely to have SP when you sleep right after SP happened).But , SP never happens after that.But , I was only right before the stage of SP and maybe I'm too aware of it when its about to happen, and that's why it didn't. but I feel tingling in my head and vibrations as well ,while dreaming.This time I dreamt about my crush , which is hiding from me recently.I've already accepted the fact in real life and was not too depressed about it, but in that dream which is right before the SP stage , it felt so real and it hurts lIke 3x more.My emotions were SO REAL. I woke up being down and sad , and of course I continued to sleep again to make SP happen.And, this time, I fell into a sea, randomly.I was at the same stage as before as well , tingling in my head and vibrations surronding me.I can feel like the sea water going into my ears and my body sinking slowly into the sea.My ears felt so uncomfortable as I thought the water was in my ears and I woke up, once again , and checked my ears.I'm so amazed before the SP stage happened I can dive so much into the dream.I think the last one which is falling into the sea , just if I'm aware of I'm dreaming , I was able to lucid at that moment.",1
What Happened?!? I have not idea how to categorize this!,"So this is from about 10 years ago (about 8 years before I could Astral Project) and while I was living in a house with weird paranormal shit which I won't include in this post.  To this day I still can't figure it out.  I woke up into a sleep paralysis situation (laying on my back) for the first time ever because I couldn't breathe and I could not see clearly without my glasses but there appeared to be a horned demon-looking thing on my chest choking me with one hand.  I could feel the across the front of my neck and I could look around with my eyes but I was pinned down and nothing came out when I tried to scream.  I starting praying and struggling to move and with all of my effort I was able to raise my left hand up and get a strong grip (my weaker hand though) and grab a wrist of the hand that was choking me.  I clamped on to the wrist and starting pulling the hand off me neck.  Once I started to get some air, I regained some strength and I was able to pull the hand about 6 inches away from my neck when I realized WTF! My left hand had a death grip on my right hand which was still open and doing a single hand choke across the front of my neck!  I don't remember if the demon started fading before or after I realized I was being chocked by my own hand but this doesn't make any sense to me...

* If this was sleep paralysis, then how could my right arm do this?
* If this was alien hand syndrome, then why has my hand never exhibited behavior like this before or after being in that house?  The only other times that I know of anything similar happening to me was what my wife told me after I told her this story the next day.  She told me that my right hand had tried to choke her a couple times in the prior week.  I was laying my stomach then and luckily my right hand couldn't get any leverage at full extension from the side and she said that she was able to wiggle free.  She said she just assumed that I was dreaming and was considering sleeping in a different room if it continued, but didn't mention it until I told her what happened to me.

We did some things to cleanse the house and eventually moved out, but I can't remember the timing of those things with respect to when I tried to choke myself out, but it never happened again after that.

Any theories?",1
Can sleep paralysis happen in a dream?,"So i had a dream where i was trying to sleep like in real life just but it wasnt working, i think to myself, “ill just go get some marshmallows from the kitchen. For some reason i think my lights are clap activated so i try clapping but i cant move, i decide to look up and i see someone looking down on me. It honestly scared me to death because the person looked too tall to be a family member. I think the shock is what woke me up because the next thing i remember is looking up while lying on my bed. My heartbeat was high so i though “oh it was just a bad dream” but when i look to my left to lay on my side to go back to sleep, its there, the same person looking at me. It didnt move but now i couldn’t move and i thought i was gonna die because i was awake and not dreaming. I , not wanting to keep looking at it closed my eyes thinking if i cant see it, it cant see me. Around 2 minutes passed and i opened my eyes and it was gone.",1
Don't really know what to make of todays morning,"To set the stage: I (m20) slept in my gfs bed, while she was at university studying. I fell back asleep after she left at around 9 in the morning. I then dreamt a somewhat normal dream and suddenly found myself lying in her bed alone. Barely being able to move, i tried opening my eyes a little more but they wouldnt open all the way, so i was struggling already. After about 30 seconds of fighting to get my eyes open, someone entered the room. I could just hear a male voice but the figure itself was invisible. He started talking to me about something philosophical and a theory of his, which i sadly forgot about through the day. But he got really angry after i said that i like to believe in facts rather than ideas but i wasnt unfriendly or anything. I told him i understood him and liked his idea but i couldnt blindely accept it. ""The voice"" got so angry that he punched me in the face, or at least it felt like it. No pain, but a shock through my body. At that point i fought with everything i had to open my eyes and push him away but i was barely moving. The most i got out of myself was pulling the pillow from under my head over my face. Then i suddenly woke up amd could open my eyes fully.

Now i really dont know anything about sleep paralysis, neither if this was anything close to it. But it effected me through the day. I'ld just like to hear some opinions. So if you read it, thank you kind stranger. Have a good one :)

TLDR : an invisible dude spoke to me about something philosophical while i wasnt able to move. He then punched me and i woke up.",1
what the fuck happend this morning,"i dont know a lot about sleep paralysis, but i know the basics and I think I might have experienced it this morning.

I was almost awake and ready to wake up, until I suddendly felt paralyzed in my whole body. I felt a figure behind me put its teeth down to my neck and started biting me. It was really uncomfortable and scary but it didnt hurt at all. I never got to see the figure but I could hear it making noices. 

After like 30-45 secs of this going on, I finally woke up finding myself punching the side of my head before I sat up and realized that it wasnt real. 

Really scary experience, I'm so scared that this will happend agian.",1
Bursted blood vessel in eye,Last night I had a pretty intense SP episode and I was struggling harder than usual to get out of it because I fell asleep on the couch and could hear my family around me so I was try very hard to get their attention. Later that night I got up to go to the bathroom and when I looked in the mirror I noticed a bursted blood vessel (red dot the size of a sesame seed) in my left eye white. This is very strange to me as this hardly ever happens. In fact I can’t remember any time that it has and I’m 43 years old. Has this happened to anyone else?,1
NSFW: my sleep paralysis rapes me,"No clue where I'm supposed to talk about this but I just woke up to sleep paralysis again and after what felt like an hour of desperation, finally broke out of it. I never see anything when I get sleep paralysis reccently, I cant open my eyes during it but I do litterally feel myself being raped and someone's nails digging into my arms and really painful sex and it's one of the most awful things I've ever experienced and im just so so desperate for a solution, this is a desperate cry for help.",1
Is it possible to control your sleep paralysis?,"I’ve been having sleep paralysis off and on since I could remember. I’ve always had intensely vidid and lifelike dreams since I was a kid. I smoke weed and still have dreams that feel so real. Many of them used to be watching people die, but it was always their skull crushing, like those old liveleak videos of decapitations and cruel things😣 it’s started to get better in that aspect but I’ve been getting more sleep paralysis lately. This morning I got it bad.  i could see everything even though my eyes were shut but in a weird reality. I calmed myself down and first tried lifting up my fingers but nothing. At this point I was just having fun with it. I tried so hard to open my eyes, it felt like a piece of my brain was getting pulled out or something weird. I stopped trying to open my eyes because it hurt pretty bad but I started trying to yell for someone to come in and I guess try and wake me up, but all I could hear was myself barely making a mumbling noise. lastly I tried my body again, it was buzzard, I started to feel my muscles spasming and my hands started twitching uncontrollably, or so it felt. I’ve never had a seizure(I pray to god it stays that way) but I’m assuming that is what it may feel like. Anyone relate? Has anyone been able to control it?",1
I don't know what to do,"I first posted something similar in r/sleep cause i didn't know this sub existed. I searched this sub and i couldn't find a similar question, but if there is i apologize. 
Ive had sleep paralysis for a long time and i dont get scared anymore. I barely even get visual hallucinations anymore so now it's more of annoyance than a scary experience. 
However, the thing i usually use to snap out of it (moving my thumb and then all the other fingers and moving up my arm) doesn't work anymore. 
someone said i should try to close my eyes but that just starts a lucid dream and i end up sleeping. 
I have a decent sleep schedule but i end up closing my eyes a lot during online classes and almost immediately when my eyes are closed i have an experience. 
Is there any way to wake up immediately? 
Ive even tried to watch the class through the paralysis but its really hard.",1
Being attacked by a sucubus during SP?,"I generally dont feel physical experinces during my SPs but last sunday un the afternoon I took a nap with my GF suddenly felt paralyzed and feeling that something squezzed my both nipples (not in a pleasant way 😕) and after that the same with my buttocks I was having a painful time when fortunately my GF woke me up. 
I Felt a presence there I closed my eyes by previous experiences.
Has anyone experienced something like that?",1
Question regarding third eye,0,1
I think I experienced my first SP this morning...,"I was fast asleep this morning when I felt two hands holding on to mine firmly. For a second, I assumed it was my mum, but I begun to realise that it wasn't. I was trying to open my eyes but couldn't; it felt heavy to literally open my eyes. I then begun to shout for my mum, and even begun to shout for my father (who I do not talk to, and haven't for the last couple of years...that's how terrible this situation felt). However, this was only processing in my head as my mouth was not moving, though I could hear me shouting for help. This, what I believe to be a SP, lasted around 10-20 seconds. I woke up at 4:27 am and didn't even look at my left side (where I felt this happening) for like the next hour. This was no dream, I literally felt a firm grip in my hands. It felt like whatever was holding my hands was crawled, and I ""sensed"" a black figure.",1
I was able to control an SP episode for the first time,"A few nights ago, I fell asleep on my back which often triggers an episode for me. At some point in the night, I opened my eyes to see a woman on top of me. Her head was far enough away that I could make out her features; looked to be about mid 30s, had dark brown hair that was twisted back into a late 1800s style, soft eyes, and overall pleasant features. Now that I'm recalling her appearance, she kind of looked like an older version of me from a different era. She looked like she had something urgent to tell me, but idk what it was or could be. I knew immediately what was happening, and I just couldn't be bothered dealing with an episode, so I willed this woman to morph into my bf. I just looked at her and thought ""you're just bf messing with me"". All of a sudden, she took on the form of my bf and became relaxed, putting his head down on my chest and snuggling me as he normally would. As soon as I registered it was now him, I went back to sleep. This was definitely the chillest and least scary episode I've ever had, and first time I was able to control it in any way. Though now I really wanna know what she had to tell me.",1
Was this sp?,"I had one terrifying experience, but I'm not 100% sure if this was sp or just a nightmare.

It happened 3 years ago. At the time, my daughter was still a baby and would often cry at night and wake me and my wife up.

We went to sleep at our usual time, there was nothing particularly interesting happening that day and there was no sign that something weird would happen.

I remember waking up in the middle of the night and first thing that caught my attention was the light. To be more precise, the absence od light. We used to sleep with our bedroom door open and light on in the bathroom, so it would give us just enough light in the room to manage, since we were getting up often to take care of the baby. 

But now it was very dark, I could barely see shapes around me. I was lying on my back, while my wife was sleeping on my right. I felt she was moving, so I asked her if she was awake. 

Me: are you awake?
Wife: yes 
M: what time is it?
W: I don't know
M: why is the light off?
W: I don't know
M: did <our daughter's name> wake up?
W: who?

At this point I got very confused, something wasn't right with the way she was replying. I tried to look at her, but I couldn't move my head at all. I started hearing this big commotion from her side, like something very big and heavy was moving and loud, heavy breathing, like a bear was breathing down my neck. Suddenly I was really scared. I was desparately trying to move or stand up but I couldn't. I was sure that this thing next to me wasn't my wife, but something pretending to be her. I remember thinking it wasn't someone, it was SOMETHING. 

Somehow I managed to move my left arm and I remembered there was a night stand on my left, with a lamp on it. So I reached out, grabbed the cord and started searching for the button to turn it on. I found it and started pressing, but all I could hear was clicking and there was no light. 

At that moment, noise to my right became unbearable. I felt strong pressure on my chest, like someone put a boulder on it. I couldn't breathe at all, I was sure I was dying. I saw a hand (it looked more like a claw) with long nails reaching out and grabbing my right arm. I could feel it's nails ripping my skin and it felt like I just blacked out for a moment. 

Next thing I know I was sitting in bed and screaming. Wife was holding my right hand, at the exact same place where I felt the claw. 

Somehow she managed to calm me down and she told me that I started crying really loud in sleep and it woke her up. She grabbed my arm to see what's wrong and I just jumped and started screaming. 

I never experienced anything like that again and I sure hope I won't.",1
Experienced sleep paralysis,So last night was my first time with sleep paralysis. I didn’t see anything but I heard this loud ringing in my ear and felt the force on my hands. Nothing too bad but tonight my mom had it. I woke up to her yelling ‘Help me’ but it was so quiet I almost didn’t hear it. I ran to wake her up and she said a dark figure tried to crawl into bed with her and was just staring at her. I was just wondering if this was hallucinations or maybe we have a demon in the house that’s getting us both? It freaks me out.,1
Kissed by a Being,"How many people have been kissed on the lips by something while in sleep paralysis?
My friend just told me their story of SP and they were kissed. I had the same thing. During an afternoon nap I had an SP event during which my mom’s friend from my childhood Paula walked into my room. Paula was never a threat or anything but a nice aunt figure in my life. Her daughter and I were friends growing up. Either way during this SP Paula came into my room, slowly walked around the bed to the side I was laying on. This whole time I was trying to scream, but couldn’t muster anything due to the SP. Paula sits down on the side of the bed right next to me, leans in and then gently kisses my lips. I’m still trying to scream and wriggle myself out of the kiss, and after a few moments of terror I was able to snap myself out of it. 

Is having an apparition kiss you during SP common?",1
Any particularly funny/stupid experiences with SP?,"This one's pretty tame, but during my last SP episode, I was going through all the usual methods I had to try breaking out of it - move my fingers, flutter my eyelids, ignore the creeping shadows threatening to overtake me, etc. I managed to wrench my jaw open and had a brief moment of triumph, before my body settled right back into sleep paralysis, this time with my mouth frozen wide open. I spent the next five minutes or so trying to close my jaw and thinking about how stupid I probably looked, before falling back asleep. 

I also had a different experience in which I had an SP demon (which I normally don't get) looming over me. Instead of having a head, it had my phone sitting on top of its neck with the screen showing someone I disliked calling me, and I hallucinated my hand reaching out to the demon's head to accept the call. That was fun. 

What are some of your sillier experiences with SP?",1
First SP episode,"Hi everybody, I am seventeen years old and experienced sleep paralysis today. I woke up about  5am and started running errands by 7am. While I was running errands I decided to go to the library and pick up a book- the book i picked is Emily’s Brontë Wuthering Heights which was originally published in 1847- I read the first chapter and started to doze off once I arrived home. My senses and awareness were still intact and I started to daydream. I was dreaming I was at a movie theater- when i suddenly felt someone smothering me irl. I thought someone was sexually assaulting me- I was being spooned/ choked. I couldn’t defend myself and was unable to speak/ move for around 2-3 minutes. << It felt a lot longer. I started to feel intense fear. Once I was able too, I shot up and realized nobody was there. I went to my mom and started to grasp what just happened. My mom immediately prayed for me when I was able to discuss what happened to me. She thinks it was a demon- I called my friends and they believe the old book is haunted. I am not really a superstitious person and don’t want to believe it was any of that but I can’t deny the fact I felt a presence.",1
Is it just me?,"I have been getting SP for as long as I can remember, at the beginning it was very panicky and usually accompanied with a scary dream. But for the past couple of years (I get them every couple months I guess) I'm very aware of whats going on, and my dream is very life like - I'll dream that I am in my bed, and trying very hard to get up or scream for my partner to help me get out of it, sometimes I do manage to get up in my dream, but then it ends and it starts back to the beginning, still stuck in bed. Its so life like that I have to ask my partner in the morning, did I manage to get up and talk to you last night? I've even had ones where it feels incredibly real when I've tried to text my partner, and I was certain I managed too until I checked my phone in the morning. These episodes lasts for 30minutes it feels. More irritating than anything now.",1
Recovering from an episode,My SP episodes often in the middle of the night. Does anyone have any methods they they use to successfully get back to sleep after an episode?,1
An actual good sp experience,"I've been dealing with sleep paralysis for maybe a year or 2 now and my experiences are always violent. I always hear weird things and my body feels like its moving at the speed of sound in a direction that changes every 2 seconds. Earlier tonight, I had that type of miserable sleep paralysis. I got to sleep once more, and I have this weird culmonation of dreams and borderline nighmares and wake up once more. At this point its around 5am. I give myself a good 15 seconds to realize everything was a dream and attempt to sleep onces more. When i closed my eyes i saw this faint light and my first thought was to chase it, dont ignore it. Im not in any dreamscape yet so I only raced towards it mentally. The light got bigger and brighter as if it exploded in front of me and i chose to embrace it rather than take cover. Boom, im paralyzed.  My body felt at rest and everything was in slow motion. I tried to move around and I think i saw my own figure do so but it looked more like the silohette of my own soul rather than my body. I couldnt escape my body so it felt like a failed attempt at astral projection (something i srill have never done) because i opened my eyes too early but it still felt amazing.",1
Experiencing Hell through sleep paralysis,"So this all started when I was 14. I was very into demonology so I read a prayer to summon Satan. Later that night I woke up and was completely paralyzed. I started praying and as soon as I finished the prayer with “amen” i was able to move again. The most disturbing part was that right after finishing the prayer I heard a sinister laugh in my right ear.  Fast forward 5 years and I experience a 2nd sleep paralysis. Before this happened I was begging GOD to show me that hell does exist and that I was ready for it.  2 weeks pass by and it happened! 

   I was in my room getting ready for bed. Woke up around 3:30 am and I was paralyzed. I tried fighting but couldn’t. Out of nowhere half of my room turned pitch black and out of the darkness I saw a shadow of a demon with horns. It came towards me and wrapped his arms around my neck and dragged me straight down into a dark place. As I was being dragged down I felt immense depression and had no hope of ever getting out.I told myself “This is it! Nobody will ever find me here”. This place was pitch black but for some reason I was still able to see the demon. I freaked out and said “Jesus help” and was instantly let go. As I came out of the darkness I heard a women yelling “HELP ME”. That alone made me believe hell was real.   This experience happened so fast but felt like eternity. 

Ever since that experience I’ve had dreams of demons being cast out of me. Everything is fine now but I don’t recommend asking or wishing anything unless you are ready for it.",1
SP LD or nightmare?,"I woke up around 2:30 a.m. soaked in my own sweat and scared as hell. I had a dream that all I could see and hear was white noise and I couldn't move properly,  talk or swallow. I got up from my bed scrambling around trying to get help from my parents but I couldn't hear them or really see them due to the white noise. I felt a lot of electricity going through my body and it felt like I was dying. The dream happened twice because I remember ""waking up"" to the same experience. When I finally woke up for real I was shaking and cold, and it felt like I had experience something like death or an abduction (the world felt surreal and sad). Has anyone ever experienced anything similar, especially the white noise and feeling death aspect?",1
What is the earliest memory you have of sleep paralysis and/or a sleep intruder?,"I don’t usually talk about my SP in detail because I feel like focusing on recent experiences make them get worse but I am curious about my earliest memories of SP. I swear I have had it my whole life. My earliest memory of it was when I was around 4 or 5 years old (I know this because of where I was living at the time) and it the way it was would be like a nightly routine into my nightmares. I would fall asleep and there would be a figure standing over me speaking to me and basically instructing me. He would then push me into the nightmare and at this point I was lucid so in the beginning my Initial response was to rebel and get myself out of the nightmare, but then I would find myself back in my room with the figure shaming me and my behavior (sometimes even shaming me for behavior from real life). Eventually I grew out of that and experienced different forms of SP but I’ve never forgotten that first terror.",1
What happens if someone tries to move you while going through sp?,"Title says it all really.

For a long time now I’ve tried to communicate to my girlfriend when I’m going through sp through trying to change my breathing pattern if I can. So far I’ve been unsuccessful in getting her attention. The idea is she would just try and move me and get me snap out of it.

I don’t know if it would work but I figured it was worth trying. I wanted to know if anyone else has tried the same and if it works? I was also wondering if it would hurt?",1
Anyone else thought sleep paralysis isn't that terrifying?,"I'm now 18 and when I was 16 and 17 years old I had frequent sleep paralysis happening , like it could be 4 to 5 times a week sometimes. The first time of course it is terrifying for me , can't move any parts of your body, the more you resist the more your fear grows.But after a few months experiencing sleep paralysis , I've figured out how to get out of it in a fast way , is by keep moving your toes(which you can move) as well as your eyebrows sometimes.And using this method I can get out of it in maximum 5 seconds.

So another special sleep paralysis experience happened later , when I was sleeping at night I had SP again.But this time everything felt much more heavier , it is a lot harder to move anything , and this time I opened my eye a little bit. I saw a black figure or dust on my left side.It felt cold and chills on my arms and shoulders. I can hear it mumbling beside my ears( can't listen to what it says).
I felt terrified back then , but when I woke up I feel like its not that horrible , as I'm interested in sp myself that time. So after that experience any other SP is not terrifying anymore for me. And even today I had SP in a nap after a very long interval for not experiencing it , I even feel myself grinned when SP happenned.

Am I crazy or I feel excited because its been a long time until today I experience SP. As I know SP can become luCID dream when done properly(which I failed everytime).Maybe that's why I am excited and I feel like dreams in SP is something so special and different compared to ordinary dreaming.",1
Demon played with my body,"Hello guys, I had some SP cases in the past but i was only paralysed for few seconds and then was everything ok. Few weeks later i had my first case with the “demon”. I was paralysed and I realized that I have SP again.. Then i moved my eyes to the corner of my room and saw a black humanoid creature. That creature Immediately dissolved into a black fog cloud and flew over me to my back. Then that fucker grabed my body and started pulling me over my mat. He was doing that aprox. For 10 second and then i woke up at same place i fall asleep. It doesn’t help my insomnia. And I need to know if somebody had similiar experience like me..",1
Repeat Experience,"I wanted to preface by saying I have only experienced sleep paralysis once before in high school. I was facing the wall next to my bed with my back to the room. I woke up and was immediately confused, wondering if I was still dreaming. I couldn’t move, but I could open and close my eyes. 

I felt something tug on my braid. I felt it once and assumed it was just my imagination. But then something whispered in my ear. And laughed. It rugged on my braid again, harder. 

I tried to scream, to move but nothing happened. The third time it yanked on my hair I managed to scream for my mom. Who ran in and ‘woke me’. 

Last night I woke up in the same bed. Even though it’s been over six years since I was in my old room. Again I couldn’t move and the experience repeated itself. I couldn’t move and that thing was laughing and whispering words I couldn’t make out. 

At some point I screamed for my mom and started fighting to move because I scared the bejesus out of my boyfriend who woke me up. 

I’m really creeped out because I never wear my hair in a braid anymore when I sleep because of that experience in high school. And last night was the first night I had put it in a braid in a long time.",1
Had my first sleep paralysis,"Hey guys,

One week ago I had a car accident which caused a concussion. Last night I went to bed around 8:30 because I felt tired and dizzy. I have used some benzo’s to sleep the last couple of days but I threw them away cause I didn’t want to have withdrawals, that on the side. 

It felt like I haven’t slept since I went to bed and apparently I had and have really realistic dreams where I’m texting people, drinking some water etc. and after waking up I realize I have slept and it was a dream. 

So around 23:00 I woke up or I was still awake, not sure.  I felt a very heavy feeling on my chest, had a weird buzzing sound in my ears, couldn’t move or talk. It felt like someone was coming for me, I could actually hear it coming closer. As I said I couldn’t talk or move, I tried to say “stop” or something like that. It was horrifying and I was scared to sleep after that, I have slept around two hours, and again with the realistic dreams so I don’t feel like I have slept. 
This experience has really scared me and I’m scared to sleep from now on when I’m alone. I can 100% say this was the scariest moment of my life. Anyone who has any tips for getting over this? That makes it sound quite dramatic but it really scared me. Thanks in advance!",1
"Last night it happened, and it felt...beautiful?","I was laying in bed about to fall asleep when I just opened my right eye, I tried closing it to go to sleep but I couldn't it felt like it wasn't quite responding, I probably opened my left eye while focusing on closing the right one, and so never picked up on the fact that it closed if it did, I guess.
After that I try to get under a blanket, that's when I noticed, my body weighed a ton, I simply couldn't move, I started thinking to myself: huh interesting, so is this sleep paralysis?
Then I started asking myself: dang if this is sleep paralysis then where is the demon? I want the interesting stuff to be in it too! I thought to myself that I may aswell experience it all, at that point my brain picked up on the queue or something and went started working; darkness.
Darkness started to engulf my room, like complete pitch black darkness, and then 3 orbs of light that sort of left behind them a trail that would fades into the dark popped up, they started spinning, they eventually became more like multiple small orbs, my 'demon' started forming, a bunch of spheres spinning around formed infront me the shape of a human.
Multiple small orbs revolving each on a different plane to make the shape of a human, that being of light looked mesmerising, then I started thinking to myself: didn't people say the demon chocked them? And so after thinking it put it's 'hands' around my neck, I couldn't feel them, my breathing wasn't in anyway constricted.
After that I guess my eyes managed to close or something? Or maybe everything returned to pitch-black darkness? I reckon it's the prior because my back started spasming, maybe it was more than just my back but I'm uncertain.
I tried to open my eyes while back was spasming but couldn't, and then after it was done I was able to control my body normally.
 I actually felt more parts of my brain working than usual, idk why I feel my brain like physically working sometimes and being physically foggy some other times, but that's another issue I guess.
My back felt better after the spasms then it usually does, it was like a natural massage I guess? Lmao.
It didn't really feel scary, it felt...rather interesting and weird, maybe beautiful is a way to describe it, it left me curious about what happened and wether or not I was asleep.",1
Spiritual view of SP,I had sleep paralysis a couple of years ago but tonight i heard a story from another person and I’m wondering if i should see it as something to do with my religion. Should i have seen the shadow as a demon or a spirit. Idk but it never came back idk if it’s a good thing or a bad thing but it did scare the shit out of me in the moment.,1
F sleep paralysis!!!!,Geeze!!!! I was in a dream and all of a sudden I sort of became aware. My ex was talking kind of badly about me..it was something I got defensive about..anyways..his eyes turned black and i was like oh ok let’s face this demon head on then! So I saw his eyes and sort of went into them..and i could hear this “euuhhh” growly screaming voice..I was like whatever I need to expel this demon shit and fully confront it..then I “woke up” and the screaming was outside of me. Like ewww like right behind me..just this AWFUL noise...omgggggg What the actual...ugh f***,1
My experiences,"Hello everyone! I just discovered this sub and wanted to share my experiences in the past with sleep paralysis. All of these are years old and I haven't had another in quite some time.

1st: My back was facing the ""witch"" and she was using a hold spell of sorts to keep me in place and drain my energy. She had long grungy hair, wore a white mask with black V lines down it, and was giggling as I fought tooth and nail to turn around even though oddly enough I could see her from behind me. This struggle goes on what feels like forever when my alarm clock finally goes off, I see waving rainbow clip art text that reads ""Goodbye"" and then my cat bolted down the stairs. Shook me up for a few days and felt way too real for comfort.

2nd: I was dreaming that I was a soldier on a hillside over watching a snowy field with a red barn. I saw a figure come out from behind the barn. I look through my scope but the figure is no where in sight. As I pull away and look with my naked eyes however, the figure was MUCH closer. Again I look through the scope and again, nothing. Each and everytime I do this, the figure moves closer and closer until it is 20ish feet away. I could see it was the same masked witch, my fingers were frozen on the trigger, and then suddenly I am ""awake"" in my bed, unable to move, and the masked witch is just staring at me from across the room. I try to scream, curse, and fight with no luck and she just...watches. Eventually I am awoken by my gf at the time who said my breathing and grumbles concerned her enough to check on me. 

3rd: I was at a friend's house spending the night. All was normal until I role over and see a brown hooded cloak, mid rotting figure that instantly puts me in the breath gasping freeze that we all know too well. It slowly extends an arm, revealing a flesh rotting hand, points a half bone finger  at me and says, ""I will consume you."" I try everything I can to scream and curse with no luck. Eventually it gets up, leaves the room by walking through the door, and I am suddenly able to breath again. I laugh, ""Ha yeah that's right run away you lil B..ch!"". I  get out of bed and open the door only to see the hooded figure directly in front of me. I am frozen again, forced back onto the bed, and it continues to point and repeat over and over, ""I will consume you."" Eventually I am awoken by my phone and shortly afterwards make a quick goodbye from my buddy's place.

4th: I ""wake"" up, unable to move or breathe. I begin to see a shadowy mass of fog to my right begin to solidify. This one however I am able to self break away from, it vanishes, and after a few shaky hours, I fall back sleep soundly with nothing else.

5th: Again I am ""awoken"" in the typical SP state. I look around but see nothing. I then hear my stairs creek as a very fat plague dr. makes its way up into my room, turns the corner, and just stares at me. I try to yell, ""Go away!"" along with a series of slurs and insults. It eventually slowly turns away and walks back down the stairs and I am able to finally sleep peacefully once more.

Those are all of experiences with sleep paralysis. I have no idea why they all hide their face and I seem to always enter fight mode when it happens. Also I think I should add that all of these events happened during very stressing times in my life. I have never had a single event ever terrify me the way SP has and as odd as it sounds, I low key miss that feeling. Now nothing seems to really scare me and I miss that primal fear. Thank you for taking the time to read my tales and I look forward to reading everyone else's on this sub.",1
It felt like a spirit was channeling through me,"So, I recently joined reddit and discovered this page. I’ve shared this story with a lot of people but none that have experienced SP before, so I’m looking forward to any responses to this. 

———

About the time I was 15, I had come home from school around 2:30 like most days. My mornings started at 5am, so naturally I was very tired upon my homecoming. I would take a quick nap most days before starting homework. One day, I routinely went to take my pre-homework nap only to be “woken” a few minutes into closing my eyes. This is where it gets terrifying for me. 

So, I was laying on my back cus I just fell back on my bed and shut my eyes. I remember opening my eyes and seeing these flashes of very bright light in various colors... light purple, light blue, pink, yellow.... I tried to move but I couldn’t. Then, I sat up at like a 45 degree angle (if 90 degrees is sitting normally)... I was stuck like this. I tried to talk but couldn’t. I felt like my soul was stuck in my body but I had lost control. It was a bizarre feeling. Then my mouth started to move “on its own” and I began to try to say words that came out sounding like gurgles. I felt like my body had been taken over because I kept saying “help me” ... it felt as though I had a male spirit in me trying to talk to me or someone. Idk. After what seemed like forever I was “released” and I fully woke up... I jumped up and ran to my mom and just sobbed because it was so terrifying for me. It still fucks me up to this day and it’s been over a decade.",1
Paralysis too lucid dreaming,"Can someone tell me how to get from paralysis into a lucid dream, I was told it’s possible, but I find it very difficult to do. It would be really helpful as I literally have sleep paralysis almost everyday lol.",1
just a question fellow sp'ers,"hi everyone,

my first experience with this was about 10 years ago.
ive had multiple episodes a night for weeks straight.
the last year ive had no cases whatsoever.
it stopped ever since i smoke a joint before i go to bed.
and i was wandering if more of yall had weed as a solution
im here in no way to adress that this is a solution but just wondering.

thanks",1
my first sleep paralysis experience,"i think i've experienced sleep paralysis before.. but not the sleep paralysis where you see shadows, hear noises or feel like you're being touched. i just couldn't move, but i didn't feel fear and after it had gone away i just went on with my day. anyways, today i experienced something i would never wish on anyone, not even my worst enemy. 

when i decided to call it a night i put on binaural beats to help me wind down, and when i did fall asleep.. people might say that, that could've been the cause.. but, i've been listening to the same sounds made by the same person for months and this has never happened before. who knows though.

i had a dream where i felt my tooth was about to fall, but i was 100% aware i was in a dream, i even said *'oh well this probably means something.'* after that, i had a false awakening but i felt scared for some reason.. i went to look for my sister but i had just ended going in circles around a random neighborhood. people kept staring at me and trying to talk to me in that dream.

after that, i actually woke up but i couldn't move. i tried really hard to, i looked around my sister's room (i'm over at her house for a while.) and everything looked normal, no shadows, nothing scary. i motivated myself and told myself not to give up and to keep trying. i tried really hard but still couldn't move. that's when i tried to reach for the closet door handle. i might've been imagining this because i felt as if i did grab onto the door handle. anyways, from there i tried to pull myself up so i could go find my sister. but, every time i tried it felt as if there was some sort of force or energy stopping me from doing so. i tried this for a couple more seconds before falling onto bed. i was out of breath from trying to get up so i just laid there but then i started to feel uneasy, and dread.

i was terrified at this point and it was just an overwhelming energy that really scared me. i think my intuition was telling me that i had to leave because i had a feeling something was about to happen and that's when i heard something. it was a ringing sound but like a siren or one of those trumpet sounds. i tried calling out for help. in my mind i could hear myself clearly but when i actually tried to scream out to my sister, not even a whisper came out. i kept trying to call for help but after a while of trying i had started to give up, i laid there closing my eyes scared out of my mind. after a while i finally had the ability to move and to breathe.

my legs felt very tingly and it was difficult for me to stand but when i finally did i was just so scared. i had no idea what had happened. and i was trying to think of an explanation of what that was. i bursted into tears when i found my sister and i told her everything.

i have a strong feeling that when i was trying to reach out for the door handle that it was some sort of astral projection. but all i know now is that i experienced sleep paralysis. i just really hope this was the first and final time that that ever happens.",1
Just had another episode of sleep paralysis. Please let me know how I can stop this from happening again.,I fear it’s getting worse and I want it to stop.,1

Did i have sleep paralysis or was it just a nightmare??,"So yestarday when i fell asleep it was all normal and i had  a dream, in my dream i was in another country in the house where my grandparents live. It was day time and i was going to bed and when i fell asleep i woke up and could not move and i couldn't even say anything but i could hear my voice and screams in my head and then i see a woman with very white skin, black short hair and green lizard eyes and she had a big smile on her face and her teeth were sharp kinda like shark teeth, sha had big claws stretching down to her feet. She was floating towards me and a song started to play and i realised it was the Halloween theme. I started to panic when she came closer to the point where she was standing beside my stomach, i couldnt move but i heard my screams in my head. She lifted my leg up and skratched them from my ankle down to my knee leaving a really deep wound and there was blood everywhere. She did the same thing to my other leg until i woke up to my mom shaking my shoulder and thats when i also woke up from this nightmare or whatever it was. Im just wondering if this was real sleep paralysis or just a nightmare where i had sleep paralysis. Yes i have expirineced sleep paralysis before but there were no creepy stuff just me not being able to move while i was awake and panicking.",1
*trigger warning*,"I’ve gotten sleep paralysis for years now, normally i know how to calm myself down and get out of it. I’ve seen demons, dark figures, etc. But this last time I got it, there was a man figure on top of me trying to rape/ sexual assault me. I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else, I googled and didn’t find anything. just don’t want to be alone it was scarring.",1
Talked with the “Devil”,"To start off, I’m aware this was my hallucinations brought forth by my intentions. Just thought it was a cool story to share.

This morning I had sleep paralysis. I decided to experiment. I had the intention to hear the most demonic voice possible and see if I could scare myself. 

First it began with this blood curdling scream/ yell that was both deep and high pitch at the same time. It was so loud it sounded as if speakers where blowing out. It also had this slight digitized tone to it that sounded like it was glitching or distorting.

Since this was my intention I remained calm. I then tried to go into a lucid dream. As I did this I suddenly heard a voice start talking to me. It was extremely deep and low, very demonic and animalistic sounding. It said “I’ve fallen, Evan. I’ve fallen.”  (my name)

Reminding me of the story of Lucifer falling from heaven.",1
First In a while,"I have not had sp In a good while. Last night,
I was having a pretty pleasant dream and I’m not exactly sure how it switched from that to a horror film. What I can remember is all of a sudden I’m “awake” in my room. I’m on my bed and a dark figure walks right toward me and I’m terrified. I try to open my mouth to call out my bfs name(he was right next to me) and I couldn’t. I try to move I couldn’t. My anxiety was through the roof and I just had the feeling that this thing was going to harm me. It seemed evil. I almost forgot how terrifying these experiences are. Does anyone know if stress relates to sp? That’s all I could think of that could have triggered it.",1
"Mysterious creature touching me when i go to sleep, and sometimes when i wake up","I dont know if my experience can be categorized as sleep paralysis, but it is definitely something like it. I hope that maybe someone has tried something similar, or know something about it.

For quite some time now, I’ve been experiencing these weird confrontations with some hands touching me when I go to sleep or when I’m about to wake up. But it is especially bad when I’m trying to take a nap during the day.

In the start it was just mysterious hands touching me, but it is getting worse. I’m experiencing it everyday lately, and I’m seriously afraid to go to bed.  A month ago it happend once or twice a week, and it was “just hands”. But now I feel like it’s a full creature, like a spirit or something hovering above me.

Sometimes I feel like it is mad, and sometimes it’s not. I’m completely conscious when it is present, and I can even open up my eyes, and I’m able to move. If I wait too long with waking up myself though, sometimes it will push me down in the bed, giving me trouble to breathe. And sometimes it will breath me in the head, and I can literally smell the breath. That is obviously super terrifying, also considering the fact that I’m only 14 years old and I still easily get afraid of that kinda stuff.

But sometimes i don’t feel like it’s mad or dangerous, and I will just let it be there for some time while I’m too tired to get completely out of bed. But it is also at that point it feels the most real, and not nightmareish. It is invisible though when I open my eyes while it’s present.

Excuse my not so good English, it’s not my first language.",1
Can you dream about having sleep paralysis?,"I know the title sounds stupid so let me provide context. I went to sleep at around 9pm and woke up at 2am and this whole week I've been sleeping with my light on ( just forget to turn it off) so I was always have to get up and turn it off. So that happens and I'm not really tired so I scroll around on netflix and find a show to watch, So I watch that for a hour or so and just naturally turn my head to the other side of the bed and see a women lying there staring at me, So then I immediately look up from my side and lay on back when I start to hear noises at the back of my head. Then I see a black creature slowing start covering my door so this is when I try move my hand to cover my blanket over my head to not see whatever that creature was and I couldn't move it and I thought to my self is this sleep paralysis? Somehow I manage to close my eyes (This is where i'm not sure if it even was SP) but when I was close my eyes I just see like faces pop in and out of blackness nothing in particular to remember just random faces. Once the last face disappears I either am awake for a bit then sleep or fall staright back into sleep, The sleep after was nothing scary but a fairly long dream and I remember waking up in between the dream and remembering this whole ""SP"" experience but shrugged it off and continued the same dream in my other sleep which is odd for me as it's never happened before where I can sort of recontinue a dream. I know sleep paralysis can be different for different people but I didn't experience a feeling of not breathing, I could close my eyes for a brief second, and I thought to myself mid SP that this was an ""SP"".  That's why I think maybe I dreamt this and it was a nightmare and you think it's that just call me out for it I'm not trying seek validation for a SP experience . Um I think that's all it's a bit long so if you read it all, thanks. Sorry for my bad english cbf to read over again aha. But yeah would like to hear people's thoughts about this one.",1
Positive affirmations after SP experience ?,"Can anyone pass on any helpful affirmations , chants , or sayings to calm the spirit after an SP experience ?",1
Does lucid dreaming cause sleep paralysis,"Almost every time I've lucid dreamed or at least tried to lucid dream I've woken up unable to move (sleep paralysis) directly after it ended, also lots of the stories I have read have said how it was after a lucid dream so, do lucid dreams cause SP?",1
Just had my first sleep paralysis!,"Aight so to get things started, my room has a window which leads to the deck. I was lying in bed on my phone at like 11:50pm and was super tired so as you'd do if you felt tired, I went to sleep. At the time of having the sleep paralysis I was just lying down on my bed facing the window and couldnt/didn't move (don't know if I even tried). A couple seconds go past once waking up (by waking up i mean entering the dream, it felt like waking up) and i hear two to three people talking on the deck. Immediately, I was shook because the only way onto the deck is either going past my room and opening the door or climbing up the vine thingo. So I'm in bed thinking we're gonna get robbed. A few more seconds go by and the two people stop talking but I can still see their shadow through the window. Suddenly I feel someone's hand pulling at the back of my neck and I wake up in a sweat. 

This was a crazy experience because everything looked and felt SUPER real. The hand at the end grabbing me also felt incredibly real. If you have, thanks for reading :)",1

Weird story read if you want to,"So I was already well rested but I woke up around 12AM so I tried to go back to sleep around 3AM and I woke up in my dream and I was there with my grandma and someone unknown people. Fast forward I was sleep on a couch or something (eyes open, still in dream) and I tried moving, and I couldn’t. I started rubbing my legs together and moving my toes. The weird thing is I could see my body in my dream. I was able to move after a few seconds then I woke up in real life unable to move. I moved my toes again and I was able to move for like about 3 seconds and then I was literally frozen again. After that I moved my toes and sat up so that I didn’t get frozen again because I was getting kinda scared.",1
"Is it normal to get ""sleep paralysis"" before you even go to sleep?","There have been a few times where I'm ready to take a nap and I feel this creepy tingling feeling making its way up from my feet and I realize that my body is slowly going numb.

Couldn’t wake up from my dteam,"I was dreaming and for some reason I guess I noticed that and that made want to wake up but I couldn’t really wake up from my dream and I got the feeling thar the people in my dream were trying to let me stay in the dream.

Unsure,"Sleep paralysis: People talk about demons invoking fear in their victims. Much like a creature such as freddy Kruger entering dreams except it isn't as vivid. You can't seem to make much out of anything. 

My experience is from roughly two years ago, I was dreaming and believed I had woken up, only I hadn't. 
I was experiencing sleep paralysis. There was something above and behind my head. I sleep with the top of my head to the wall and so this shadow figure was leering over me through the wall just above my eyebrows. I couldnt see much as I couldnt move. My bed was in the centre of my room at the time and the door was slightly open. I always sleep with my bedroom door shut. It was open and the light in the corridor was on. I thought this was strange in hindsight ofcourse but at the time I was completely in shock. I was screaming for my dad and trying my hardest to move. The best I probably managed was a loud and distressed moan. Either way my mum heard me and came. My dad wasnt even there It was strange and terrifying. The weird part is that when I woke up the door wasn't open as much as in the dream and the light was off.",1
Very intense sleep paralysis,"I had this very bizarre experience where I was in sleep paralysis for a good 10 minutes (or that’s what it felt like) and couldn’t get out no matter how hard I tried (I can usually get out in a couple of seconds), near the end of the paralysis my room started to get covered in this white cloth and out of nowhere I got slapped on the back and thrown across my room and out my window. Then I woke up and back was still hurting a little, luckily there wasn’t any weird handprint on my back that wouldn’t been so scary",1
My sleep paralysis exp.,"i experience s.p almost every night ,i have insomnia from the fear of it..before it happens my tinnitus gets louder...i believe its caused by demonic attacks though..sick people sometimes die in their sleep from sp cause they can't fight back thats my theory..if this is really a brain activity? Why does burning inscents help prevent it for a few nights?",1
Had sleep paralysis at the same time in the same bed as my boyfriend,"Me (18f) and my boyfriend (20) had sleep paralysis at the same time for the first time. It was very weird- I was hallucinating and hearing words I couldn’t make out and felt the need to check my surroundings and saw something standing over the bed. He woke up at the same time in a panic after being unable to move... and expressed that he heard heard a strange noise and felt really weird, like he was being touched. The vibes were off the rest of the night I felt horrible Energy in my room. it made it all seem more real that he experienced it as well, the negative energy wasn’t just in my head. What does this mean? Is this common? Really just my question is - what the fuck happened to us? Share your stories and why you think this happens. Like wss is paranormal, does it have something to do with the moon phases or what?",1
What type of sleep paralysis is this,so it would start and i would have a hard time breathing. i’m screaming but my voice isn’t heard. i try my hardest to snap out of it. it usually last for a minute. then i snap out of it. but then i feel so tired and fall back asleep in the span of 10 seconds and i’m experiencing sleep paralysis again. i would then repeat the cycle and a whole episode would last 30 mins. i am too tired to get out of bed and gather myself and would fall back asleep to sleep paralysis. i can’t find this type anywhere online.,1
I Had A Rather Disturbing Sleep Paralysis Hallucination And Need Help,"Hello everyone, I have been experiencing sleep paralysis since I was 13 years old. Most of my hallucinations have been visual and audio based that was within the realms of reality. There was a particular sleep paralysis hallucination where a wardrobe in my room was replaced entirely by a darkened figure within a rocking chair haunched over. The darkened figure had their arms pulled forwards and was spinning a feminine mannequin head. The mannequin head was characterized with an angular face and sharp cheekbones. Small red lips of lipstick with red eyes and pure black hair that was shoulder length. As the mannequin head twirled it would slowly decay into a mess. Dirt, exposed flesh, and what I imagine was snot running down the face. The window on the opposition of my bed was a train going by with orange lights sprawling across my ceiling. It was not a dream as I moved as normal eventually and ran to the bathroom. I told a friend about this and they never had a sleep paralysis hallucination replace full objects. I am now concerned and need some help. I am willing to cooperate to the fullest extent of my knowledge and really need something to figure this out.",1
SP and horrible screams,"Hi! Reading some posts I remebered one ocassion in which my SP started and as I ddint want to see weird things I closed my eyes...

I have SP episodes and now my BF can induce lucid dreams on me and stop SP without waking me up. Any toughts?,"Hello everyone, I am a very athletic 23 year old girl. Throughout my life I have experienced strong SP episodes,  strong enough to even become cyclical dreams, lucid dreams and with out-of-body sensations.
Now II sleep with my boyfriend and he has helped me waking me up when I have SP, and watching me during my slepp. It often happens that after experiencing strong orgasms I fall into a deep sleep. Many times I experience SP, so he has been looking for creative ways to wake me up (it's very complicated). On the last occasions he has managed to make me interact with him, speaking to me while I sleep and that has caused him to guide lucid dreams. 
He can tell me something and then it happen in my dreams, I can eat whatever i want, fly, ride a bike or any strange creature and even ride a rollercoaster feeling absoluty everything.  Sometimes even dreaming about having sex. 
The last time it happen i was dreaming about a forest and 'something' (Sleep Demon) appeared, I was so scared that i could comunicate that to him so he started talking to me and tickle me(in real world). He appeared in my dream and the SD vanish 

Any similar situation?",1
"Confused about my recent SP episode, been really paranoid.","I felt a presence during my SP episode for the first time and I wasn’t fully paralysed in bed this time, I was sitting up straight during the episode and felt like I was being pulled by these two black hands and was yelling for someone to come help me. This went on for a few minutes till I suddenly woke up. I don’t have much experience with SP episodes but from what I’ve read people are usually unable to talk and move. However, I was able to yell for someone and could move a little bit to try to break free from being pulled. Is this still an SP episode? I’m just really paranoid and haven’t been able to sleep properly since. I don’t believe in a paranormal presence or anything supernatural but my mental health has been at its lowest lately so my mind has been wandering to the darkest of places and i’ve been believing the worst in every situation which is why at the back of my head I believe that it might be paranormal and not psychological. If someone could tell me if what I’ve experienced is still just an SP episode that would really help.",1
Sleep Paralysis Only When Napping!?!,"Anyone else only experience sleep paralysis when napping? Specifically when your about to wake up from the nap? I never experience SP when I’m sleeping through the night. 

I don’t see any shadows or figures above me or hear any odd noises.  However, I am able to see my surroundings, but remain unable to move or speak whatsoever.  It’s even happened in the car before (not driving obviously).  It usually ends with me panicking and forcing myself to fully wake up.",1
Fitbit Findings,"Hey everyone! Does anyone else in here have a Fitbit and wear it to bed to track your sleep? I am curious as to whether or not your findings are similar to mine. I didn't sleep well last night, and ended up falling into a sleep paralysis spell in the morning before I was supposed to wake up. Knowing this, I looked at my Fitbit app, and I see that it shows me as being in a REM state for about 25 minutes, and then jumping to awake. I was stuck in it longer than normal, but I was also tired and didn't fight it. 
Anyone else have these findings?",1
Experiencing sleep hallucinations or something else?,"A few weeks ago, I went back to my house and went straight to bed at about 8 in the morning. I'm certain I was asleep, but it felt like my eyes were wide open, as I saw my whole room and my two dogs laying beside me like they were before I slept. I also heard some strange noises, some of were which like someone or something was walking hastily outside my room .my door was open and I wanted to check it out, but I couldn't move. I tried shouting and moving my hand, but to no avail, I couldn't. After a few minutes I could finally move. What did I experience?",1
"Thinking about how disturbing it was the other night when I woke up from something squeezing my side in a dream and woke up still feeling an intense pain on my side, for at least a good few seconds","I’ve had plenty of sleep paralysis experience, especially when I was younger. This didn’t feel the same as the others tho. It was much shorter, and I didn’t know I was in it until I pondered on it later and linked the comparison of something putting force on me that i couldn’t see... knew it was nothing good though.",1
Sex With Myself,Has anyone had sex with themselves during astral projection? As in your spirit is having sex with your body. That is the best I can describe it.,1
First time someone has appeared,I've had sleep paralysis a few times but never was there a presence of anyone I just had sleep paralysis again and it was a little different I couldn't move and there was a light in my closet then I lock eyes with a 6ft man standing in there then after a few seconds everything goes black and I hear a ringing and I can hear myself scream internally while he is breathing on top of me I genuinely thought a man had entered my home because he looked like just a normal human I hear people describe demons but this was a human being,1
Almost died lol,"So,
I just woke up from sleep paralysis. I didn’t see any terrifying figures and I wasn’t attacked during it. But, the scariest thing about this one experience was that I was so self aware during it that I thought to myself “okay, I hope I don’t stop breathing like last time”. But of course, because I thought it, it had to happen. 

So I was lying there, unable to breath and it was basically a race to see if I could break out of the paralysis before I actually suffocated. I’d rather the shadow people anyday....",1
You sleeping paralysis experience?,"Hey, i decided to post mine and hear about your experiences related to this. So we can maybe help each other understand this better. 
I have this happening to me occasionally, usually in the morning, rarely during the night.
Mine usually starts by hearing noises in the other room while fully aware im alone in the house in that moment. Also i can hear banging and knocking on the door or a doorbell. 
Than i feel like i have three shadows visiting me, always separately. Only when im alone in the house.

1st one seems tall and he usually quite, just looking at me.

2nd one seems like a crawler, noisy; making sneezing like sounds, hitting objects and his shadow i see moving quickly around the room. 

3rd one seems chubby and he interacts with me physically. He is noisy as well but aggressively. I can feel like he is sitting on my back, kinda shaking me ( like someone wants to wake you up aggressively ) putting some pressure like pressing me against the bed while im sleeping on the side. I also feel pain on the pressed part of the body after i wake up but it fades away after a few seconds. 

Honestly i am not sure what to believe when i read studies and opinions on this. It feels sooo real. And i feel weird all day long.

I am not using drugs, drinking or have necropsy as i noticed these were stated as possible causes in some medical researches. Also i wasn't jet lagged or tired when this happened.  So i really don't know and don't have any valid explanation i can trust fully.
 
What is so interesting for me is that we all have similar ""hallucinations"" and similar feeling while this is happening. 

What is your experience? 
And what explanation is more convenient for you : scientific or alternative?",1
Im not like the rest,I fell asleep tonight around 11 pm. I had a few crazy weird dreams where i felt a presence. I would wake up a minute get comfortable and fall back asleep. This happened all in one night. I was on my last dream before i finally woke up completely at 1:00am .. In the last dream there was an entity or demon of some kind standing in my closet room (which is connected to my bedroom) i went to try to fight it or something i ran into it. It was tall and long greyish black with no features. As i run twords it i am standing where it is and i feel faint and weak. Next thing i know im in my bed and my head is facing my wall to the right and im on my back. Im looking over and i see its face sort of and it looked evil like a grim reaper demon almost but it was shorter this time. It said I AM NOT LIKE THE REST. I couldnt move. I knew i was dreaming but i couldnt open my eyes or move or anything. My legs felt numb. I said to myself in my head jesus loves me over and over and about a minute later or so i was able to move and open my eyes. I cant sleep now. I am not a super religious person. I do believe but i have my doubts. I have never been baptized or anything like that. My family is Catholic though (grandmother and back in her days they were) my mom and i have never gone to church but maybe a few times when i was younger. I have recently started looking into the crystal healing and witchcraft stuff but i havent practiced any candle magic or spells. I would only do that with good intentions and if i knew what i was doing. But i do fully believe in all that stuff and i see it as my own spiritual way. I was watching some videos about this woman and her haunted house before I went to sleep. But i always do and watch scary movies alot too. Idk what that thing was but the fact that it SPOKE to me like in my head almost is what has gotten me awake and freaked out. My SO is asleep next to me but i cant fall back asleep. Has anyone else experienced this entity? Or what could my dream mean? I am cleansing tomorrow! Thank you so much . Blessed be.,1
How to purposely get sleep paralysis,"I know people don’t really want sleep paralysis but I kinda wanna experience what it’s like. Is there any way that anyone knows of to get sleep paralysis? Or if u had sleep paralysis, what happened?",1
Shadow being choking me,"
I’ve had episodes of sleep paralysis before. Never like this. 
I was woken up by my fiancée coming to bed at 2:20 am after he fell asleep on the couch. I fell asleep in the bedroom with the light on (I’ve done this often lately as I  have recently become uneasy in the dark, like something is watching me) I remember him coming in and turning the light off and complaining about me having left it on again. It startled me awake, but I quickly fell back asleep. 
I dreamed my sister was in my living room and my mothers dog. My sister was sleeping on my couch and my fiancée was in bed with me and he all of the sudden woke up and said he needed to go to the bathroom (he does this usually all the time throughout the night). I knew deep down this was a dream because my sister lives in CA and I live in FL, but yet here she was. 
So my fiancée says he’s going to the bathroom, I hear him get up and the bathroom door close. 
I’m left alone in my bed and I feel something bump the bed from underneath, I turn to the other side -my fiancées side of the bed and I see it. A shadow being, no face, messy short hair, heavy male energy and very long pointy fingers. I’m paralyzed and I can’t speak. It looms above me and then it starts to choke me. I can’t breathe. Can’t move. Can’t scream. I eventually am able to get the words ‘help, please help’ and call out my fiancées name. It feels like forever and this thing feels like it’s killing me as it’s chocking me. Finally I’m able to turn my head to the other side and look away from this thing, I close my eyes and scream in my head ‘it’s not real it’s not real it’s just a dream’ I immediately wake up its 2:34 am (it felt like forever in my dream) I turn around and it’s very dark, I reach across my bed and my fiancée is there. I just held his hand and eventually fell back asleep. I didn’t dream after that, I woke up in the morning and my fiancée asks first thing, why were you screaming last night... Which immediately reminded me of the whole nightmare. 
I’ve been having a lot of nightmares lately, but I’ve never dealt with a shadow being trying to kill me. It’s usually people I know or animals, never some unknown entity. Plus my SP episodes are never this intense. I felt so helpless and scared.

I’m annoyed because I had been focusing on astral projecting and now I’m just too scared to even sleep. I’m 8 months pregnant with my 3rd child and my first pregnancy symptom has always been very vivid dreams, but I’ve never had nightmares like these.

 I don’t know if it matters but I saged the whole house earlier that day... so I don’t know if maybe I let something bad in or pushed all the good out.",1
I had quite the scare a few years ago. Does anyone else name their demons? Or is that a me thing.,"SP, the minds way of messing with us.

I had one encounter with my sleep paralysis demon. I named it The Long One.

Does anyone else name their sleep paralysis demons?

[This is a long read but it's my story of my encounter with The Long One. ](https://www.reddit.com/user/EatsSoapOnTheDaily/comments/hzqim0/a_soap_eaters_sleep_paralysis_experience/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",1
Anyone else experience these visions?,"Okay my SP started about 3 years ago maybe 4?..it started with the average weight on my chest and just fighting myself to be able to move to catch a breathe, but as time went on i began seeing things, like flash images, or even things moving around. Not just shadow people, but ive seen strange entities. Some times i do have a negative feeling seeing them and other times i dont. But im really curious about if this is common..last night i started having a spell, i was laying next to my girl, and ofcourse struggling with SP, but i kept seeing these 2 entities at the foot of our bed, to me they seemed female(idk guess thats the impression i got.) But their hands were on fire...for one flash theyd be moving back and forth and the next in my vision(or so i like to call them) all i seen was their hands touching our legs and then them laughing...the point of this is just seeing if others have similar experiences or maybe some help. I dont feel i have attachments im just curious..the entities ive seen are usually profound and specific.",1
How do you cope?,"I'll be honest, I've thought about posting in this forum a few times to share my experience, but it is still too disturbing even for me. So I'll just ask the question without the experience. How do you cope with hallucinations in sleep paralysis? I get the full range from tactile, visual, and audible. They seem to be getting worse and it is causing me to lose a lot of sleep.",1
I’ve never had sleep paralysis with open eyes.,"I always read about people getting sleep paralysis where their eyes are open they have crazy hallucinations and such... but my sleep paralysis happens with my eyes closed and I rarely experience any type of creepy auditory or any such hallucinations at all.  For me the scariest thing is how my breathing is automatic and often more shallow than I would like.  


What are some of your SP stories that freak you out about the phenomenon?",1
Sleep paralysis?,"So I have a common state of sleep paralysis, at my old place it was normal to be greeted by the random figure in my room and being startled awake. Recent I had moved in with two of my friends, and I haven't quite noticed anything cause they tend to wake me up when they leave to go somewhere. Well today it was a normal day, I woke up to my roomates talking so I got up and made food. I timed something on the tv andnoticed I was still tired so I tried to take a nap in the recliner, this I had learned was a bad idea, an hour later I had woken up and heard a whisper say ""She is looking for you"" I was able to move my head so I thought it wasn't sleep paralysis, I tried to see who was talking then the same voice shouted "" She found you!"" My head snapped back to the chair and I could feel all my limbs being held down along with my head and neck. I screamed help but to me it sounded raspy like I was saying nothing, so I tried to move and knock something over but whatever was holding me down stopped me completely. I screamed for help again and I heard my roomates door slam open. My roomate, who is starting he first year as a nurse was running to me, I was facing the other way, I was finally able to move and took a deep breath in, she had said ""I had heard a noise but thought it was the tv, then I heard it again so I came out and heard a faint 'help help' and came running to you, you shot up like you have been underwater for a while and started breathing frantically."" My limbs all are sore like I had been working out and my neck hurts, I can still remember every detail in that moment but I want to be sure it is in fact sleep paralysis, cause that was the most intense episode of it I've ever had.",1
Is my experience sleep paralysis,"This happened at about 5am this morning and it's pretty foggy in my mind but I don't know if this was just part of a dream or sleep paralysis, I remember waking up and not being able to move so then I realised what was happening so I shut my eyes to not see anything scary since I get very scared easily and all I remember was hearing lots of voices and the feeling of being touched by cold hands, was this sleep paralysis or just part of a dream since I don't remember waking up straight after it happened",1
I just had sleep paralysis for the first time and idk what to do,"I’ve never really had many dreams, let alone sleep paralysis but at 4 this morning I did. It was a dream at first. In the dream I woke up and my room was dark, but there was a spotlight on a German Shepard in the corner. It started to speak english, then realized I was awake, stopped, charged me, and bit my neck. Then all of a sudden I’m back laying in my bed and I’m getting choked by two hands. My body starts shaking like I’m having a seizure. My eyes are wide open. I can’t breathe. My body stops shaking. And after like 3 seconds of trying to force myself to move my shoulder finally twitches. I regain control of my body and I jolt up, terrified. Idk what to do. I’m still horrified. Someone pls help me",1
Longtime SP'ers,"For those of you who've had episodes of sleep paralysis for an extended period of time, how would you describe your experience? What is it like when you get episodes now? How long and frequently have you been getting them, and did they start when you were a child or later in life?

I'm 20 years old and I've been getting SP ever since I was about 8. It happens as infrequently as once in 6 months and as frequently a few times in one week. I get a strange feeling before it happens and sometimes can prevent it. It doesn't scare me so much as it annoys me. I don't hallucinate and I have improved control over my body (since I know which parts are easiest to try to budge). It usually takes less than 15 seconds for me to snap out of SP now.

How does your experience compare?",1
oh oh oh!! it got more intense for me,"i've been experiencing SP from highschool. it comes with from just seeing shadows, voices, got air blown in my ear like someone blow a candle, and the more i grow up, it got more close(?) to me...?

this time i was dreaming i was asleep and got SP in it (i saw me in a third person). when i realize it was just a dream, the SP seems to stop. i tried to have a reality check by tring to look down at my fingers, but it was hard, i saw nothing but bright lights and none of my hands. and then it changes from third person to my pov lying down on my stomach just like in real life. but then, something towering over me on the edge of the foot bed. it started poking my lower back, and then goes up on my arms, and my nape before it whisper something with a women voice. it was like calling me, i felt like it was a warning too (shoot i don't remember). when it move i felt that it was standing on my bed, beside me, the bed and the sheets felt like it was moving, like there was really something on my bed. and then i realize i'm alone at home, it was not hard to open my eyes because (idk what gotten into me) i want to see what it was. nothing. and i awoke. i tried to close my eyes again, hoping that i can continue it or at least took a journey to have lucid dream but it was not working.

idk why i feel like it got more intense than before.",1
Can you guys share your sleep paralysis stories? I want to better understand what happened to me and what it means.,"I’ve only ever experienced about 4 of them but recently I experienced a stronger one. Usually I just feel paralyzed, can’t speak, and I see a dark figure in the corner of the room. Always the corner. It lasts about 2 minutes or so. This recent one though, lasted about 6 minutes and it was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced in my life.

So recently I have been trying to fix my my sleeping schedule so I have been going to sleep at around 8/9 in the night and waking up everyday at 5am. Now, since I’m barley starting it’s not easy and I don’t wake up with 100% energy. I try to keep myself moving so I won’t fall asleep. This way I can go to sleep at 8/9 without any problems. The reason I do this is because I have trouble sleeping so every single night I take a sleeping pill and I’m trying to get off those. You know, stop depending on them?

So one day I woke up at 5am and I share a room with my sister and my mom wakes up at 5am to go to work. So once she leaves, I brush my teeth, wash my face, make myself some breakfast and head to her room to watch some Netflix. I usually watch the TV sitting up in order to not fall asleep but this day I wasn’t feeling too good so I laid on my back while still watching Netflix. I wasn’t planning on going to sleep.

I just want to add that I NEVER sleep on my back. It’s just kind of uncomfortable for me. I’m a side sleeper. BUT, everytime I’ve experienced sleep paralysis, I was on my back. I don’t know why this happens so if someone could explain that to me, that’d be nice.

So anyways, it was around 10 when I had finished making breakfast and watched a couple of hours of Netflix. Now I know I said I try to keep myself moving but around this time my mind is 100% awake and I’m not sleepy anymore so I just stay watching Netflix until I have to do something else. But like I said, this day I wasn’t feeling too good.

I was watching Netflix and I didn’t really notice at what point I had fallen asleep. I started having a “dream” where there was a man inside of the room and he was sexually abusing me. I have never ever experienced anything like that and in my dream I could FEEL the pressure on me and my thighs. I was yelling and crying in my dream. The room was dark because my mom has black curtains so I couldn’t see the man in my dream. The man then ran out of the room and I don’t quite remember what happened in between this time period but I then started hearing metal clanging right outside of the room. The door was closed and I just knew it was the man. I was so scared I started crying and hyperventilating in my dream and in real life. At this time I thought I was awake and this stuff was actually happening. It all felt so real. I was laying on my back, my body was stiff and I couldn’t move. My eyes were open and I was staring right at the door. I heard the man outside of the bedroom and he was yelling like a maniac, he was clanging on what sounded like metal bars. It sounded like a warehouse. Everything echoed and I heard multiple clanging noises even though there was one man. The sound got closer and closer to the bedroom as he was getting closer and closer. I felt my arms and legs start to shake as I was making so much force trying to get up. I was still paralyzed and I could feel the tears falling down my cheek. I was terrified. The clanging and the yelling man got closer and closer and the closer it got the more terrified I became, once the noise got as close as the door, my body shot up so quickly and I moved to the opposite side of the door expecting the man. I looked all around the room for signs of the man. Still crying. It wasn’t until about 5 minutes later that I realized he wasn’t real and I was just dreaming. It felt so damn real, I will never forget that day.",1
First time happening to me; I thought I was going to die from an earthquake,"Hey guys, this is my first post here, and seeing another couple of posts, I think I had sleep paralysis. First, I didn’t see nor hear anything from what I remember, and I also could move, at least after the worst had happened anyway. My boyfriend suffers from constant sleep paralysis, and ever since we moved together he told me they got better, so he was the one to tell me I might have had it. I was woken up because I felt a horrible shake. I felt as if something was dragging my body and bed extremely hard. I live in a highly seismic zone (the strongest and mos destructive one I’ve lived was of 7.1), so earthquakes are a bit normal to us.  

Anyway, I felt as if that was it for me, as soon as I woke up I sprinted towards the door and tried to wake my boyfriend to tell him it was shaking. As soon as we turned on the lights, we saw the water in our nightstands be completely still and saw it was in fact *not* shaking so I started to panic really bad because then I didn’t know what had happened to me. My boyfriend told me ""From how you’re saying it, it looks like you had a sleep paralysis minus the visual and auditory hallucinations"" And I do believe too, that’s what happened to me. I don’t remember having a bad dream before it happened, and to be quite honest, I couldn’t remember at all what I was dreaming about. Jokingly I told him ""Well, I don’t know, but if it ever happens again to me, I won’t doubt a second to sprinkle some holy water in our house"" and tried to get back to sleep. He also told me I was lucky it was all physicall and not how they usually go because I can imagine they can be quite scary. 

The strange think for me was that as soon as I felt it, I literally jumped from my bed and sprinted towards the door. I thought you couldn’t move *at all* with sleep paralysis, and I’m thinking  the fact I live in a highly seismic area had maybe something to do with it. Maybe it triggered my subconscious fight or flight response? I don’t know guys, but I really, really, reaaaally do hope it never happens to me again. I’ve never felt such terror as this one before and now I’m scared to go to sleep :(",1

Did I just experience sleep paralysis ?,"I was dreaming just now, 2:32 am, then suddenly i’m awake and I can see a dark figure in the corner of my room, it brings true fear upon my body and I couldnt move, it lasted about 10 seconds.

Black chain hovering like a dna model,"So this has happend 3 times where I wake up, look and see a dark chain, twisted a little like a double helix off the the side of me, like 6 feet away. It might be a re occurring dream part of it, I have had sp probably 2 times a month ( not bad, just feel like I'm not getting enough air and cant move, I end up shaking myself out of it) I'm getting looked at soon for sleep abnia, but I wanted to see if anyone else has seen this. Again, I dont see anything/anyone when I experience the sp, but afterward/ if I wake up outa no where I'll see that black chain. It's not spooky when I see it, it's just there then it goes away, half asleep I just asked my wife if she saw it and she had no idea what I was talking about.",1
I think i solved my sp problems temporally,"I bought melatonin tablets online because i got a job thats during the night so i had to change my sleeping schedule. But before that i would get sleep paralysis often especially if i try to lucid dream again, out of the 3 times i opened my eyes 2 was nothing but once i saw black hands coming out the wall trying to get me, from then on i close my eyes to wait it out. Now that i take the melatonin to change my sleeping schedule i havent had sp for 2 months. (Btw i just found this sub).


UPDATE: i think its okay still but i still need it for my job. on my off days tho when i dont take it i noticed sp is way more intense. this time something was screaming and it caressed my ass which lowkey freaked me out. just to be clear i dont recommend buying pill online cuz i probably got the habit forming kind of pills but its effective so far.",1
Boyfriend wants to experience SP even though I told him it’s terrible,"I’ve been having SP for about like 6 years. It’s always been horrible, yet only rarely do I see figures/shadows because i force myself to keep my eyes shut whenever it happens.

Anyways, I have opened up about my SP to my friends and family. It turns out my sister (who has a room next to me) experiences SP too. But my other sister, doesn’t experience it and neither do my parents. 

I told my boyfriend about this ever since we were began dating which was about a year and a half ago. He’s always said that he wants to experience it. I told him that it is absolutely terrifying and I wish that feeling on no one. But he doesn’t care, his mind won’t change. I don’t know how to get through to him. SP has been traumatic for me in the past. It gives me a lot of anxiety and feelings of terror when I’m in it. I don’t know, I just need help on how to make him realize how horrible it is for me and that he should never wish it upon himself.",1
The woman in the portal,"When I was younger, around 15 and going through a bunch of messed up stuff (depression, being expelled from school and my parents locking me in my room for 3 months) and essentially going insane, I experienced my first (and only) sleep paralysis demon. To start with some background I was never a good kid in highschool, i was constantly getting into trouble and starting shit with my family. I was the outcast since I was into heavy metal and into darker stuff like the occult. I went to sleep one night and woke up in my bed 9n my back completely paralyzed and dazed. I started to look around my room confused when I noticed there was a black circle above my window (my room was on the second floor of my house) and that it was growing bigger and something started to come out of it. First it was a hand, long boney fingers as if someone took a vacuum and sucked out all the blood and fat, then an arm and another hand and arm as well, then the head. It was a female head, mouth ripped open and a black void inside, her eyes were sucken in and void of any color, not even black or white just...empty. black ooze started dripping from her mouth and she began to pull herself out of the portal, her body mangled and broken with her skin stretch and sunken in, exposing the bones poking through the leathery flesh. Her arms were ungodly long as was her neck, her mouth opened at least 3 times as wide and she let out a truly horrifying scream that sounded like a mixture of a baby crying, a woman screaming, a dog yiping in pain and a low guttural growl all at once. As she slowly pulled herself out, all i could say was ""WHO ARE YOU?"" over and over and over again attempting to move from my paralyzed state. I feel as if she gave me her name but I truly cannot remember it, which I'm sure is what she wanted. She twisted and mangled her own body in such ways that shouldn't be physically possible. I can't exactly remember if she came fully out of the portal or not and I don't remember waking up that next morning either or really the rest of my time locked in my room. After that its all a blur up until I went back to school and ever since I always feel as if there is a woman demonic spirit trying to get me, and I have trained myself to never fall asleep on my back again. While I remain an atheist today this, I will never forget what I saw that night and still have no idea if it was real or not. I truly wonder if it has to do with what I did when I was 12. By which I mean, I drew a pentagram and cut myself putting the blood in each point and the center while saying a prayer to Satan, then when it was done I folded the paper and burned it. Ever since I literally, cannot believe in God and every time I try to go to God my life goes into shit and ruin, so i of course resort back to being an atheist every single time. Anybody have any advice or know the meaning of this demon portal woman? Have any of you see her as well? I can't be alone on this one.",1
SP and bad night vision,"I've had tactile hallucinations before, but it's been a while. I realized it's kind of strange that I've never had any visual hallucinations. My night vision is terrible though: not only is my glasses prescription -7, but I also have [visual snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow), so everything is already terribly dark and fuzzy and shifting at night.

If I were to ever visually hallucinate, would my vision suddenly become clear? Or would my brain  know enough to project a staticky demon onto my night vision? Are the hallucinations 100% in my head like a dream, or are they  projected onto my actual vision, like augmented reality?  When I'm dreaming usually it's extremely nonvisual and more composed  of impressions and working with the  concepts of what's supposed to be there.  Wondering if SP demon would be the  same, and my sleep mask/horrible vision wouldn't spare me from ""knowing"" it's there.",1
Do you ever experience your whole face tightening as your falling asleep?,"I usually have this happen just as I'm dozing off, and I feel like i can't even breathe for a few seconds. Usually happens as i feel like I'm fading into a dream.",1
Multiple SP episodes back to back,"Recently I’ve had a few experiences with my SP which have been so bad it’s really put me off sleeping. I’ll fall asleep and not long after falling asleep, maybe 10-20 minutes later (I’m able to determine how long I’ve been asleep because I fall asleep watching a film or YouTube) I will wake to SP. I’ll do my breathing routine and keep myself calm as possible and when I snap out of it and come back to my body if I don’t get up and go have a cig or go to the bathroom I find myself slipping straight back into another SP episode. It’s been so bad the one time that I fell asleep and in my dream I was having SP, and was shaken by a friend of mine in the dream to then wake up with actual SP again IRL... The most it’s happened I’d say is 3-4 times in a row in the space of a few hours if that. Was just wondering if anyone had any similar experiences or stories regarding multiple SP attacks like this. The only fix to this I’ve found is like I mentioned before, getting up out of bed and doing something like smoking a cig or having a cup of tea / water for 10-20 minutes before going back to sleep to avoid getting into that horrible cycle.",1
"Not really sure what was happening, but I was pretty terrified until I had control again.","About a year ago I bought a house and starting living alone. A few months of me living there and everything seemed normal and fine except one morning. 

One morning I woke up and felt like I was pinned down and the my bed was moving towards the door and back towards my wall. All I remember is trying my hardest to move, but I felt paralysed. I don't have history of sleep paralysis and I also have a hard time believing in ghosts, but this was a pretty crazy experience. 

Nothing has happened since that morning, but I still don't know what was happening that morning.",1
How to have Lucid dream will n SP?,"Please help me to understand how I can have this experience. I have read on a few statuses how people have lucid dreams while having an SP episode.

Get a dog,"Hi all just wanted to share my experience with sleep paralysis over the years and how my two doggies have been life changing for me. 

My first sleep paralysis was when I was 6 years old. I'll never forget it as I was sleeping between my mother and father and wide awake talking to my father. I felt two hands grab my ankles and pulled me down to the foot of the bed. Awaiting me was a skull which immediately laughed at me. I then realized I could not move or make a sound. All of a sudden I heard my parents call out to me and snapped out of it. From their perspective I suddenly made struggling noises. I was too afraid to tell them what it was. 

Didn't have any more episodes until 4th grade when I was 9 years old or so. Damn 4th grade. Every. Single. Night. All sorts of ways you have read about. Shadows. Noises. Pressure. I was so young and scared back then. After that year I'd have on average an episode a month. In my 20s started dropping to every month or so, and in my 30s every 3 to 6 months. 

Well about two years ago I got a puppy. He's a good boy, very alert and protective of his happy space with his family. I went abour a year without an episode. Then the 1 time i got an episode... Heard two female voices from my wall and boom was on me and I couldn't move. My good boy barks agressively snapping me out of it. And as I come to, he is staring at my door making growling noises. I smile and go to sleep. Good boy. 

I now added another good boy to my family. I now have more love and companionship in my life. And the sleep paralysis and other shit that goes bump in the night is now eradicated. Good luck out there and stay safe.",1
Has anyone ever been touched irl when having sleep paralysis,"I’ve had sleep paralysis so many times in my life... Doesn’t really bother me anymore
But I’ve never been touched or moved by someone while having sleep paralysis, so I’ve always been curious what would happen. I always imagined that it would suddenly snap me back into being able to move, but idk. 

Has anyone here ever been moved/touched by someone while having SP? And what happened?

I have experimented this condition/problem since I was 12 (almost 30) and believe me reading some of your posts makes me feel that I am not Alone and I am amazed of the similarities of some experiences you described and mines.....

My first experience with SP was wierd one: I was tryng to sleep when I wasnt able to move my body but my eyes and head. After that I saw an Aztec sun been reflected in my room's wall, it just was there moving from one side to another one in the same wall, I suffered anxiety .....

Forced into submission and shown images,"I usually try to avoid sleep paralysis because it feels like my body is being pulled by chains until finally I can't resist it.

But lately its been going to a whole other level, I close my eyes to escape the sights that await me because I heard stories about it being bad, but terrifying images of black and white landscapes and dead trees + shadow figures around me are starting to form with my eyes closed which never happened to me as a kid, but I everything was slowing progressing until this morning.

&#x200B;

I was sleepy and got pulled into sleep paralysis and was greeted by the terrible land scapes but **It was so real that it felt like a I was wearing a VR headset,**  I was shown disgusting images of a distorted girl who looked like she had the face of a demon and 1920's cartoon like faces flashed in front of me that looked angry and had the background of a yellow film, I felt like I was being ripped out of my self, but I breathed throughout my nose and came back to my senses gasping for ear.

What’s the scariest apparition you’ve seen till date when having sleep paralysis ?,Just curious guys,1
Same “man”,"I have had the same demon for years. He comes in different forms but has the same sinister like laugh he makes when I realize it’s him. Sometimes I’ll fall asleep and start dreaming and then realize it’s “him” and then be instantly sucked back into full on sleep paralysis. These times are the hardest to shake because my body is so far asleep. 

Fwiw, I don’t believe for a second that it’s hallucinations. I’ve been dealing with the same problem multiple times a week for 25+ years.",1
Naked bald baby sitting on my chest.,"So I was taking a nap around 1 only to undergo sleep paralysis. I didn’t really feel anything else other then a lot of pressure on my chest and stomach. I could kinda move I guess. At first before I opened my eyes I thought it was my cat so I tried to nudge him off but when I opened my eyes there was this random naked bald baby sitting on my chest (with its head and back facing towards me). Then when I nudged it the thing just got up and left down the hallway past my mom who was folding laundry in the hallway (which in fact was actually happening irl at that time). 

Idk the whole thing was just so weird.",1
A try hard SP,"Before I got used to sleep paralysis I have had it almost every night more than once, there was that one time I got really annoyed then everything got insane.
First my bed started floating then it went outside my room, there were 2 hallways, one of them is way scarier than the other, luckily I was able to not look there then my bed went to the less Scary one and there were literally all kinds of sounds and images that you might see In a horror movie.
There were arms and eyes on the walls, someone looking from a window
Quick and small steps behind me and doors opening, even I thought this was too much then at the end there was a door opening with that little girl behind it
I felt that jumpscare moment coming but then I woke up....
And I was disappointed for some reason
And I thought there is no way anything can be scarier
Maybe I'm wrong?
I still get lots of sleep paralysis so I might find something better",1
In control of the SP?,"Hey! First time posting on this sub so whats up. My sleep schedules been very ass this past few days due to a change in my work. And i noticed i had a couple SP episodes during my naps. Today i decided to take a nap hoping i’d have another and hoping i can understand it while in it literally. I usually have SP 1-2 time a year so this recent jump in numbers was worrying me 🤷🏻‍♂️ what can i do. Regardless, my dream was me watching pewds play a game ( literally what i was doing prior to the nap) and then suddenly my brain woke up and realized the SP. numb body, my hearing was still the dream and my left eye was closed and still vividly seeing the dream visuals. All the points checked out and i figured might as well fuck around. I started by moving one finger at a time, thumb to finger for each my hands and feet. Trued moving my entire body but that basically messed me up cause the dream started distorting the more i tried moving. Got to a point where it was just intense static audio and the visuals of the “pewdiepie gaming video” were hella distorted, but when i stopped... the dream went on. J couldve just slept but honestly thats when a lil anxiety pulled up cause i kept wondering “hey what if i cant wake up anymore?” In the end i did my usual 3-2-1 countdown and jerked my leg resulting in me waking up. Idk what this says about SP, maybe nothing maybe useful, i just felt like sharing!",1
Dreams about having sleep paralysis ?,"I don’t really know how to explain this, but I usually have dreams about sleeping (going to sleep) only to find sleep paralysis happening (usually in a mild form).

Something creepy about my sleep,"(THIS IS A CROSS POST FROM ASKDOC SUB)
I not sure how to properly crosspost. Please correct me if there's other way. I figured out since there's something freaky with my sleep, I'll post it here too to see if I got any suggestions.



Background: male/23/ 176 cm/ 75 kg(my weight doesn't change much since I was 15) / frequent smoker/ frequent work out (5day per week, 2 hour per day)/ diet: mostly processed and unhealthy food

_

Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but this is sleep related issue. Since I was a kid, I've always has problems with being awake from sleeping. I always thought that I'm just being lazy and doesn't felt like want to wake up. But thing start to get weird whenever someone watch me sleep.

_

1) the first time I noticed, is that my brother told me that I've been sitting up for few times (this is only include the time he saw me sleeping in the living room which is quite rare.)  But I never walk.

_

2) there's once I sit up and looks for thing underneath the chair I'm sleeping on.

_

3) I talk, smile, laugh a lot when I'm asleep. Most of the time it gibberish.

_


4) I'll answer whenever someone ask me a question. Sometime accurate answer, sometime gibberish.

_

5) I once wake up with a bloody fist and wall. I'm punching the wall till I'm awake

_

6)I'll always close my alarm without waking up. Even with the type of alarm where it force you to do math. So I can do math while I'm asleep. This has caused me to not sleep at all if I have important things to do in the following day.

_

>Above is mostly notice by my brother only when I slept in the living room, which is not frequent.

_


__________________________________________________
>Below is thing noticed by my partner

_

6) she tries touching, pinching, kissing me a lot, and I won't be awake.

_

7)she even tries something more aggressive things like undressing me without me waking up.

_


8) she literally opened my eyelid and my eyes are wide open that are really red and some eye movement. (She recorded this incident, it freak me out. I look like I'm dead.)

_

All this thing happens throughout the years frequently, same goes to the thing what my partner did to me. (I think she's been doing experiment with me while I'm asleep lol)and I don't have any memory with any of this.

_

Is this some kind of illness? I don't really care about the freaky part. But I really hope I could wake up like a normal person and I could wake up on time. This has been causing some issues to my school and job throughout the years. And money is a big issue for me at this stage of my life. So if possible I hope it can be solved without visiting anyone.

Neutral sleep paralysis ?,"So, I'm pretty sure I'm experiencing sleep paralysis. I read the post here describing common symptoms and I definitely can't move, speak, open my eyes, have no sense of how much time is passing... But that's pretty much it. I have no negative feelings. It's literally just like my body is asleep & my mind is still awake. If I fight it, I can feel my heart rate speed up and get a little anxious so I learned pretty quick to not fight it. It's like I am just waiting for my body to be done sleeping. I can still hear everything going on around me, I can feel the different patterns of breathing that occur during sleep, and my fingers sometimes twitching. So I definitely know I'm sleeping, at the very least. It's very bizarre and only ever happens when I take a nap. Does anyone else have the same experience?",1
First post on here :),"Had a strange experience last night as I was drifting asleep I found myself instantly frozen and not able to move a second or so into this I hear clear as day a natural sounding robotic voice clear as day say “initiating communication you can hear me yes”, (said somthing else after that somthing like two more sentences and then stopped) and the paralysis went away soon as it started I was left feeling really excited because I’ve always been fascinated with aliens and had sleep paralysis before but never heard such a clear consciousness and calming voice come from within seemed one hundred percent intelligent and I almost woke up my girlfriend but quickly forgot the exact words the voice said and brushed it off and went to bed. I know not everyone is convinced in alien life but I believe I had a brief exciting experience I’ll never forget the crystal clear voice like I heard it in my ear not my mind really calming and concise with somewhat strange grammatical ordering of the sentences. Have anyone else experienced such a voice In sleep paralysis? It almost made me more excited than afraid which is strange as I have sleep paralysis a lot and can never breathe feel like ima die.",1
Literally felt like somebody was peeling the skin of my skull and opening my head up exposing my brain while holding me down.,"I was just thinking deeply laying on my stomach before I know it I'm unable to move. ""oh just another episode, let's just move our toes soon to be over"", I think to myself. I move my toes, nothing happens after 30 seconds or so. NOW we know we are in some DEEP SHIT. I started to hear two men with cockney accents shouting, arguing with each other. I tried to listen but couldn't make out the words. My attention quickly spat to my head trying to move it. I could move it a couple centimetres at BEST, when I did it violently shook. I felt something hold my head and legs down. I was calm until I felt the sensation of my scalp being gently peeled off. It wasn't painful but it was beyond odd and the high frequency vibrations in my head didn't help. I was panicking wanting to see whatever was doing this to me before long it stopped and I felt two hands gently go up my legs strangely calming me down. Let's say I didn't sleep soon after the outlandish experience.",1
Sp is ruining me.. rape/hallucinations,"I’m gonna start this off by saying I’m 17 and first experienced sleep paralysis probably when I was 10.
I didn’t know what it was at the time, I kinda just shrugged it off as some type of dream since nothing really happened besides the paralyzed part ofc (no shadows, sounds, etc) It never really happened to me that much back then, maybe like once or twice a year or a couple of times a month, honestly I don’t remember but I just remember it not being all that bad.

Now a few months back I woke up to sleep paralysis and for the first time I saw a shadow on top of me.  It shook me so much that just seeing it woke me up in a second so i couldn’t really figure out what it was but I know I saw it.  After that encounter my sp just got worse and worse to the point where I even experienced RAPE... I couldn’t believe it, the whole time I was telling my self it’s a hallucination but after that experience there’s just no way it can be IT HAS to be something bc I even felt pleasure?? like I didn’t like it but I definitely felt pleasured.  (To clarify I’m a straight male and the rape that was happening to me was penetration so that just fucks w me even more...) The next night or a few nights later IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  Then a few nights after that it happened.. again.... except this time there was no pleasure just pure pain.. It felt like it lasted forever and there was nothing I could do about it, couldn’t move, couldn’t open my eyes, couldn’t call for help... I try calling out for God but even that doesn’t work for me. 

After those 3 encounters I started sleeping on my back bc since I used to sleep on my stomach I thought that made it able to rape me.  This did stop it for a little while, it went back to normal sp with nothing really happening, maybe static sounds a couple of times but nothing too bad.  Then just after I thought I found a way around it, it happened AGAIN.  Though this time I don’t think it was like sex or anything but more of sexual harassment like I can feel something going inside of me but it’s not the same as b4 so I think it’s a finger..?? Idk but this happens repeatedly now every time I have sp that happens and even sometimes I can feel someone poke at my private... I just can’t take it anymore I want it to stop Im already depressed w really bad social anxiety this does not make it any better now I’m scared just to sleep bc it’s starting to happen almost every other day .. plz help or atleast let me know if uve experienced anything like this i just don’t know what to do anymore.  

i really don’t think I’m hallucinating it’s all too real the pleasure/pain AND I EVEN FEEL STUFF AFTERWARDS like after the 3rd rape I could barely sit in my fucking chair right... 

Just wanna clarify one more thing, I don’t drink, I don’t do drugs, I’ve never hallucinated b4 besides that one time in sp, and I’m not even diagnosed with anything so this all has to be real, it’s spiritual I believe it bc that’s the only way I can make some type of sense off of these encounters 

TL;DR I’ve been having sexual encounters in sp that I strongly believe are real/not hallucinations and would like to know anything that could help it stop or if you or someone u know experienced the same thing",1
Insomnia because of SP,"I suffer from anxiety and severe depression. For years I've taken sleeping pills because I'm not able to fall asleep on my own. This is because if I do because my body is too tired I get sleep paralysis constantly, literally non stop from the moment I fall asleep until the morning when I give up and get up. Every time I wake up from a SP my eyes will just shut down and a sinking feeling of another episode gives me chills and happens all over again. I literally KNOW when I'm going to have SP. 
Pills worked fine for a while but I want to try and figure out why the fuck the sleeping paralysis is SO SEVERE. And also is coming back and happening again even with the sleeping pills. (I did ask my psychiatrist but he says is only stress)
Can I ask for tips or how did you got better?",1
Hands feet under the blanket,"I have had sleep paralysis since I was just a little kid. Multiple times a week for 25 years, still terrifies me. 

What gets me the most is my hands and feet. If they are exposed from the blanket it’s as if I have zero protection, but if they are underneath the covers, I get simply tormented, not “taken”. Can’t explain it other than that. I have massive anxiety about falling asleep without a blanket over my hands and feet, in case “he” comes. 

(Fwiw, I don’t believe this to be a “hallucination”, sleep paralysis is too real, and similar amongst so many.)",1

Sleep paralysis in my dream???,"Ok has anyone else had this experience before? When I get sleep paralysis it’s usually when I fell INTO sleep, not when I come out of it. So I don’t get hallucinations or anything just feels like I can’t breathe. However recently, I’ll get sleep paralysis and do my thing of trying to wake myself up, I’ll either wake up or continue to struggle. Then... I’ll ACTUALLY wake up. If that makes sense? Usually when I’m struggling or “wake up” the first time I’ll be somewhere completely different or the time won’t be the same so that’s how I know it’s a dream. 
For example, I fell asleep on the couch around 9 am after dropping my mom off at work around 8. In my dream I’m still on the couch but my mom is back and it’s 7 pm with a sunset in the background. And in this dream I have sleep paralysis. I’m struggling to wake up, even opening my eyes a few times to see my mom at the end of the couch, then “fall back asleep” in my dream. Then my mom would touch my arm to bring me food and I’d wake up.. then fall back asleep. This would happen a few times that I actually believed it was 7 pm and my mom has come back from work. It was only until I actually woke up that i realized it’s 10 am lol. This has happened a few times before where I was in weirder places or in weirder dream situations. Has this happened to anyone else?",1
Feeling pain after waking up from sleep paralysis,"I almost always feel pain during sleep paralysis, and I often feel as if something is pinching me. The pain doesn't bother me that much, but the strange thing is that I still can feel pain even after I wake up. The pain starts to actually go away after 3-5 minutes. Have anyone else also experienced things similar to this?",1
Giving myself bruises?,I’ve been having sp but also feeling and seeing myself get grabbed by my hips or thighs pulled to the foot of my bed and lifted up and I can see myself being “held up” in the mirror. When I wake up in the morning I find bruises in the area or my legs I felt grabbed. Now I have a pretty physical job so I could maybe just be projecting but I’ll have like multiple linear bruises that look like fingers. I’m thinking I may be grabbing myself or something while I’m sleeping but I’m a little confused because I’m supposed to be paralyzed lol. Does anyone else do anything similar.,1
My first and only time so far with sleep paralysis,"This happened around a month ago, so on the day after the last day of school I was up early in the morning at 2 and I couldn't go back to sleep. I decided to get my phone and start doing whatever with the phone. So multiple times I went back to sleep on the couch for a bit before waking up. I was also super paranoid some creature was lurking at night ready to kill me  (pretty stupid I know but I'm an insanely paranoid person) So nearly as the pitch dark night turned into a more morning feel I close my eyes and then instantly open them. I saw this powder white skinny creature, face very mangled. He was walking towards me but when I opened my eyes I saw it transform into a grandma looking figure, and then it just transformed into a cardboard robot that slowly walked to the side of my couch I was sitting on (wild but very terrifying) I felt like I was there and it was real cause my phone's audio was still playing as I was watching a video. And I couldn't move, I tried moving and soon enough I was able to move but for a second while I was able to move and the weird cardboard robot thing was walking towards me it was still moving. I was so petrified  after the matter I spent 2 days sleeping with my dad in the living room.",1
New demon,"Usually the “demon” in my sleep paralysis experiences, is unidentified and mostly just a presence. Today I woke up and noticed the sleep paralysis started so I tried to force my eyes open, and when I opened I saw that I was the demon, and I was able to fight out of it and move but the demon was still there. Now I’m physically fighting with myself. Has anyone else ever seen themselves as the demon before or can explain wtf just happened",1
"This isn't really sleep paralysis, but idk where else to post this","Its only happened two or three times, but it still scares the crap out of me when it does. I wake up usually in the middle of the night around 3 or 4, and I get up to use the bathroom, but everything feels off, as if i'm dreaming. The weird thing is everything looks normal, but i can't control my thoughts and it feels like someone else is in my head, like i'm fighting my own thoughts or someone else's. At first i thought i must be dreaming, so when it happened again i called my girlfriend and followed up with her the next day and she confirmed that i had called and told her what was happening. If anyone has an idea of what this is or has had it please leave a comment. Also, if anyone knows of any subreddits that would better fit this post then please let me know!",1
Double sleep paralysis/,"Hey I just recently woke up from what I thought 2 sleep paralysis in one, I’ve had sleep paralysis around 4 times before but this was the worst one. I woke up not being able to move so gave in and waited but due to my sinus problems I had congestion and it was hard to breathe in the position I was in then my head started nodding off so I assumed it was over which it was but then I fell asleep again since I was so tired then fell into another sleep paralysis and although I didn’t have hallucinations I was terrified considering the circumstances. I know it may seem stupid to say but was it a seizure or just a really vivid sleep paralysis?",1
Just a weird experience,"I just had another sleeping paralysis, and after 30 minutes i still feel shaken. Each time, its almost the same, i try to wake up and i usually feel like waking up to another dream and so on.... It may take 5 fake dreams for me, but this time i heard my phone ringing, i tried answering it (still wasnt aware it was a SP). Then i couldnt move, but i had this feel it was a very impornant call, so i felt the need to wake up and answer it, so i panicked. I still feel this pain in my chest from it.
Also each time i experience SP i am trying to tell my boyfriend to wake me up, i feel im shouting and screaming for help but nothing happens and that is the worst feel during this.",1
Have you woke up with red marks on you?,Many times after a SP episode I wake up with red scratches and marks. The marks were more frequent in when I was a teenager (I’m 43 now). There would be a lot of half circles all over my stomach. Very weird. Anyone else? What could it be?,1

Sleep paralysis eyes open?,Hey so I did salvia and the day after sleeping felt really weird I believe I had sleep paralysis but I could open my eyes and everything looked trippy and weird I didn’t see any demons or any shit but I was kinda able to move my body but I felt my body waking up so I didn’t move and went back to bed is this sleep paralysis? I was also thinking the weirdest shit lol,1
Medical anthropology of sleep paralysis (UK),"I am a medical anthropology student at SOAS University of London and I'm currently doing a joint study comparing sleep paralysis among the UK and Russian populations.

My co-author is a Russian psychiatrist who has done research on SP in the past and takes a compassionate approach to this subject. I am now looking for UK-based sleep paralysis sufferers to complete my questionnaire, and hope that the findings can reveal information that will help sleep paralysis sufferers. 

After experiencing sleep paralysis, I conducted another study in the final year of my undergrad degree, on how SP was shared with others, and how the stigma around SP can affect doctor-patient relationships (which I hope to have published later this year). I was really touched by how frequent or distressing SP can affect people, and I think that medical professionals must learn more and do more to help people. 

The questionnaire only takes 4-5 minutes to complete:

Reverse sleep paralysis?,"I keep having (maybe once a month) this kind of reverse sleep paralysis and I’ve been trying to find a name for it, so I would be really thankful if someone here could help. It usually happens in the morning and I usually hear some voice that ”wakes me up” only that I don’t wake up. I can move my whole body except I can’t open my eyes. I’ve tried literally opening my eyes with my fingers but it just doesn’t work. I’ve tried screaming and scratching myself but nothing I do wakes me up. My body feels completely normal and one morning when this happened I tried to reach my phone and actually could feel it in my hand. And when I eventually do wake up it seems like I haven’t moved at all. So in the ”dream” I can feel myself moving and I’m completely aware of my surroundings but in reality I’m not moving.

So is this just a bad dream or what? In normal dreams I can still wake myself up by blinking or something but in these cases my eyes just feel so heavy that nothing opens them. Usually I’ve been quite calm but for some reason I panicked today when this happened and now I want some answers.

Also sorry if this doesn’t belong here, I just don’t know where else I could find some answers.",1
Mystery man opened the door,"So I had recently read a thread on AskReddit about the scariest thing that’s ever happened to someone when home alone. Someone wrote a post about how their dog woke them up barking at the door and when the looked out the peephole, there was some lunatic outside the door.

Well last night this exact scenario happened, my dog woke me up in the wee hours snarling and barking at the door in the meanest voice he could muster (he’s a 7 lb chihuahua). My mind immediately went to the reddit post and I was too scared to look outside. I beckoned pup back to the bedroom, shut the door, and tried to get back to sleep convincing myself it was just a critter or something.

I guess my fear wound it’s way into my sleep because I awoke shortly after, paralyzed in my bed, but could see that my bedroom door had opened and there was a man at the bottom of my bed. The man inched his way closer and eventually laid down beside me. I was trying to hard to scream and only producing these pitiful grunts. Eventually I reminded myself that “it’s ok, this is just SP.” Ive seen people abbreviate sleep paralysis and I guess it stuck. Anyway, I laughed to myself for referring to it as SP and shortly after I woke up, the bedroom door was still shut, and pup was fast asleep curled up next to me under the covers. 

Strange night.",1
I think I just experienced sleep paralysis for the first time ever.,"I've always thought that sleep paralysis was a myth and even if not I thought it was something that happened in the middle of a very deep sleep.
Today I woke up when someone called me and I had to explain something to them and then I tried to go back to sleep and I couldn't. So I was just scrolling through Reddit and I was slowly starting to go to sleep. And then suddenly I dreamt that 2 of my friends came inside and started talking. But I was still lucid enough to realise that I must be dreaming. Then one of my friends got onto my bed and lay there. And I could feel her behind me on the bed. Then suddenly I needed to open my eyes and it wouldn't open. And with a huge amount of effort I managed to open my eyes. But I could still hear her lying there in the bed beside me. I could even feel the pressure on my leg through the blankets. 

I wanted to check if she was actually there but I couldn't move at all. I kept trying and nothing was working. So I closed my eyes and then opened them again. It still wouldn't move. This lasted for about 15-20 seconds and then after a while my body started working and I immediately turned around to check if my friend was there and she wasn't. 

Then I tried to get back to sleep cuz I was still very sleepy. And the within a minute I could hear really loud music being played right next to me and I could also hear someone move at the head of the bed. And then it felt like they were looming directly on top of me. Again it was really hard to open my eyes. And even when I did the music was still playing. It took me more than 10 seconds this time to move my body and turn around to look and as soon as I looked there was nothing there. It was a very strange experience and frankly kinda terrifying.",1
Genuine question for anyone thats experienced sleep paralysis,"Ive read you really only experience sleep paralysis while laying on your back. Ive also read you only experience it while alone. Has anyone ever experienced sleep paralysis while not on their back or with other people in the room? Curious on how accurate this is, seems very accurate for me at least. Feel free to share any experiences. 

Edit, I do remember a few times where it's happened and I wasnt on my back, I just get a strange feeling of an evil presence in the room. Its prolly never happened to me with someone else in the room because there rarely are other ppl near me when I sleep. I'd also like to clarify, have any of you seen entities with other ppl in the room?

Another edit: Thanks for all the responses, love all the info. Very interesting",1
Can you keep getting sleep Paralysis over and over everytime you try to sleep. could it be something else,Everytime ive layed down and closed my eyes like a minute or less in to doing so i feel paralyzed and like i cant breath for like 10 seconds but i can still make noises and im having no hallucinations and i also dont feel like im not getting anywhere close to falling asleep but its happend like 6 times tonight and i just gave up on trying to sleep,1
sleep paralysis but no scary stuff,"hi! i keep on getting sleep paralysis but its different than what others perceive it to be. my sleep paralysis does not have a monster or a demon. no scary stuff. its just that i couldnt move, scream or whatever and i just get stuck there for a good 2-5 minutes until i snap out of it. its weird bcas i thought there would be scary stuff on it but mine never had one. is it still called sleep paralysis and am i the only one who experiences it?",1
My only experience with SP (I think),"     It was a fall night in 2014. My family of 6 all lived in a small 3 bedroom apartment by our local college. I am a gamer sadly so my hours of gaming would conflict with my family so I couldn’t really play on my own until around 12pm. Advanced Warfare just came out and I stayed up grinding for weapon variants. My eyes grew heavy and ears became null as I stayed up the day prior so I had zero to no sleep in 2 days. 

     I called it around 3 and felt sooo tired. But I kept looking to my left in the pitch black kitchen/dining room as I swore I kept hearing my siblings call for me and run around in the room. But they should (and were) asleep. I was out in the living room and didn’t feel like I could make it to my room I was so tired. I fell asleep on the couch, cautiously watching the dark abyss of the kitchen.

I woke up at an unknown hour but it was still pitch black. My body was feverish and sweaty and I couldn’t move without wanting to pass out or throw up. When I did it felt like pins and needles but I could still move. I slowly made my way off the couch I was sleeping on and stood up and looked at the abyss of the kitchen. I heard multiple scratches like a dog walking on tiled floors as the floor was laminated but we had no pets to do so. It was slow and drawn out and I was frozen, standing in place as these scratches drew closer. I also saw a bunch of shadow figures crawling swiftly along my kitchen floor but barely seeing them. They looked hunched and darker than black. I was filled with such dread and fear in those moments that I passed out on the floor in front of the kitchen. 

I woke up back on the couch early morning (around 7:30 am) before my family would ever wake up. Only remnants of pain in my body was a light headache otherwise I could move fine..

How did I get back on the couch.. was it all a dream? why were there so many figures? How did I not wake up sick at 10am? 

I believe it was just sleep withdrawal but it also physically affected me and my movements like a flu. To this day it’s my only real scary experience other than doors opening and slamming by themselves. But I haven’t had anything happen in the past 4 years.",1
Someone knocking on windows?,"This is my first post on this subreddit, and I'm german, sorry for any mistakes.  
Recently something started knocking on my windows at night, first time it was just one small knock, and when I activated my light, I heard something running away (I have gravel around my windows and I can hear the compression bc of this). The second time it became louder and faster, there were multiple kockings, once I activated my lights, it stopped and I heard running. this night I hard it again, but on 2 of my windows, and 2people ran away, since I often have SP. I would like to have some help on this. (btw my bedroom is in the basement)",1
Weird ladies laughing,"I had SP again for the millionth time, and it was so weird. I was lying on my side and realized I couldn’t move. I heard a woman laughing. It wasn’t a scary laugh at all. It was a normal laugh as if she was talking to a friend. Then I heard a second woman voice. She joined in, but then the laugh changed. They both made a sound like ooooooooo-waaaaaaaaa-owwwwwww. It was the weirdest thing. And if that wasn’t already weird, the first woman started lightly tickling me in my stomach. When I stopped SP’ing, I still felt it until it faded away. I never open my eyes during SP because I’m scared of what I might see, so my eyes were closed the entire time. Just thought I’d share my experience. :)",1
My SP demon,"My sleep paralysis demon is horrible, his hands are wrapped around my neck, and he's choking me, and I can't breathe or move obviously. It has long claws. like fingers and a weird shaped head.",1
Last Nights Experience,"Last night I was watching Cold Case File before bed. Eventually I fell asleep. When I woke up I could still hear the show playing but I wasn't all there. I was unable to move, but I could still understand the dialogue from the show, being that it was a show about crime/murder, being in that state made me fear that something bad was going to happen to me. I remember wriggling out of this constricting feeling and I was fully in control again.",1

I can’t stop experiencing sleep paralysis,"For the past month i’ve experienced paralysis while waking up in the morning or taking a nap during the day. It’s throwing me off because I’ve experienced this a just few times when I was a child but now i’m 21 and just moved into a new place and almost every other time i go to sleep my eyes open and my body is completely asleep, I can hear voices talking outside my room and see shadows of people walking around my room, sometimes they’re familiar faces and other times they look like dementors from harry potter. I’ve tried doing research and people say it is a rare occurrence so it’s starting to freak me out how often I have been experiencing this phenomenon. It scares me more because it only happens to me when my boyfriend isn’t home so I start to think maybe this is real? Even when I do wake up i genuinely question if I am still dreaming or actually awake. To give a rough estimate I’d say i’ve experienced this at least 7 times in just the past 30 days. Anyone have any help on how to stay calm when I do go through this or the causes of it? Or i don’t know how to make it stop?",1
So I’ve experienced sleep paralysis twice that I can recall...,"The first time I thought it was just a nightmare until I couldn’t wake up. I dreamed that my house was catching on fire and I couldn’t move. I kept trying to yell for my family but I couldn’t get a sound out. I physically felt like I was suffocating on smoke. When I came out of it I was panting and panicking. 

The second time was right around the time “The Nun” was being heavily advertised on apps like Snapchat. I fell asleep watching a trailer for it and “woke up” to the demon from it running its nails down my actual spine (like the bone itself and not my skin) and whispering in my ear. I couldn’t move and kept trying to scream but again, nothing came out. When I actually woke up in the morning I was laying in the same position as I was during the paralysis.",1
Confronting The Sleep Paralysis Demon,"I have sleep paralysis episodes 2 times a year, but I usually only see black and have to wait patiently to snap myself out of it. However on the rare occasion, I get sleep paralysis with a demon involved. When I was young, back at my old home, in my old bedroom, I was just stuck with it either hovering over me or watching me from the corner of my room. I was always terrified. This figure was a black shadow, I could never really get a clear picture of it, it was slender, skinny and tall. It rarely ever physically harmed me but like most of you know, you can feel other entities intent in dreams and its intent was always to cause harm. Even as a child, although I was scared of it I was always fairly brave, and maybe that's why it never tried anything with more malice. Sometimes it would slip back into the closet, as if that's where it originated. 

In my late teens and early 20's I started being able to lucid dream when I wanted and control my dream state. The black figure didn't return and I went 7 years since without an episode with a demon.  Last night that changed. I was having a dream of conflict. Conflict with my brother and sister. The conflict with my brother escalated and I began to strangle him in my dreams. As I got closer to killing my brother, my hands around his neck, a very simple logic came into my mind...i thought to myself out loud ""I don't want to kill my brother"". In an instant, after that thought, I was suddenly and intensely kicked from my dream into sleep paralysis state in my current bedroom where I live right now. I couldn't move and it was black, like my normal sleep paralysis. But I felt a different sense, like something was inside of me. So I conscientiously entered my dream state with lucid thought. 

As I did, there I was back in my childhood bedroom, laying on my bed with a demon hovering over me. It was a different demon, which looked different from the one I saw in my childhood. I could see it crystal clear. It was 4.5 - 5 ft tall, lanky body, arms and legs were longer in proportion to a regular humans body and the torso was shorter, it had red skin glistening with moisture and yellow goat eyes, its teeth looked like rats teeth, only 2 on the top of the mouth and 2 on the bottom. It stared into my eyes. 

I plunged myself back into a lucid dream because I was ready to confront this entity. I slowly lifted myself off the bed and came face-to-face with this demon, it did not back down. I stood up out of the bed and hovered over the demon with my teeth bared and I let out a wild, deep, unsettling shout from the deepest part of my soul. It started to slowly move back as I stepped forward driving it slowly toward the closet. Halfway to the closet the demon stopped as if to say, ""I will go no further"".  It then let out its own screech. The sound had a mixture of high and low pitches along with something like chattering in the background. This had no effect on me, my confidence to confront and repel this demon was stonewall strong and unwavering. I never actually touched the demon, but forced it back with just my mental intent to banish it out of the realm of my conscience mind. It was a slow process but by the end I had so much control of my single minded determination, that it backed into the closet and dissipated. 

I don't know if I pushed it out forever or why it's even here. But I woke up this morning feeling refreshed and energized. Maybe now that I am older and I have some mastery over my conscience dream-state mind with lucid dreaming, I will be able to continue to keep it at bay. Maybe it will never come back. Who knows...

Let me know if anyone has thoughts. I'd love to know what you think or share experiences.",1
I don’t know,"I think in 5th grade was the first time I had some sort of version of sleep paralysis. The night before it happened I got sick but the next day I still went to school thats because there was a event that I wanted to take part in, and it was going to be the last event that I was going to have in that school. During the event I started  to feel dizzy and passed out. My dad took me to the hospital. When I was passed out I could hear everything but could not move nor open my eyes. I remember the conversation that my dad had with the paramedics. The doctor asked if I had any medicine in the last 24 hours. I still couldn’t move and couldn’t open my eyes everything was black. Another thing I remember my dad telling me to not cry so I guess I was crying when I was passed out. Then I was able to open my eyes again. Went home a few hours afterwards 
I never told this to anyone because I have never been able to make sense of it and still don’t.

I don’t know if it was sleep paralysis or something else but what makes me think it is more sleep paralysis is because after that incident I have had other episodes.",1
I think I went through sleep paralysis and some demon type of shit was involved,"Last night I experienced the most traumatising thing to have ever happened to me and I'm not sure if what happened means something or it was just a nightmare or I don't even know!

So I woke up from a dream at about 4:30am but I wasn't physically awake because I couldn't move or talk. When I woke up it was like something was putting all their weight onto my chest causing it to be very hard to breathe. I was gasping for air for idk how long and then it all just stopped and next minute I opened my eyes and it was like I was in third person view ( almost like my spirit just came out of my fu\*king body. )  and was looking down at me sleeping. And then I saw in the corner of my eye this creepy demon looking thing just standing at my door - and every time I would try and wake up this thing kept moving closer and closer until he was resting right at my head and was like whispering somthing into my ear. I was still in third person so I was still looking down on this. I was just laying there so still and then I lock eyes with this thing and he just disappears. And then I woke up. 

&#x200B;

I am still freaking out as I can't get this image out of my head! Do you reckon it was just a nightmare or what. ( I don't think it was a dream as I could physically feel the pain of me running out of oxygen.) Someone help ahah I don't know if this is a sign and if I should be concerned for my safety.",1
Hat Man?,"I’ve only ever seen him once in sleep paralysis and it was the first episode I can remember having back in 2012. For me it was a man in a white suit and white hat standing at the end of the hallway. Couldn’t make out his features because it was too dark, just the suit. I know other people talk about hat man too in this thread. Is this like some sort of gatekeeper to the sp world? lmao.",1
If you have spiritualistic items...,"I thought I'd share my experience with paralysis. Until December 2019 I was having paralysis probably three/four nights a week. The usual paralysis, frozen but aware - seeing ""things"" in different places of my room. Around the same time, my best friend had a reading from a medium. He stated that someone close to her had something attached to it, and both their ""attachment"" and hers would act up when the person was over. 

Eventually we connected the dots, and after I would be at her place lights would turn on throughout the night, the keyboard would type by itself - once they even woke up and the front door was wide open. After all of this, you could say I was spooked (I thoroughly believe paralysis is connected to this kind of thing). 

Eventually after a couple of breakdowns, I realized that I needed to cleanse myself of some things. I had tarot cards on my shelf, and decided to get rid of them. I gave them to my boyfriend and he gave them to a friend who was interested. I also got rid of a Satanic Bible I had on the same shelf. 

Since December I have had paralysis twice. It may be a subconscious thing, or it may be real. From my experience, if you suffer from paralysis often and have tarrot cards, a oujia board, or any other seance items, I recommend removing them from your home and seeing if  the constant paralysis stops. 

I'd love to hear if this works for any of you!",1
I heard hundreds of people chanting chip,"I was having an extremely vivid dream, when all of a sudden I felt as though I was spiraling down. And I heard this one voice, specifically a kid I knew from middle school, and he only said chip. And then I thought haha, chip. But then he started saying it louder and more aggressively, and I heard more and more people. It was like a shouting in my ear, and I found that I couldn’t move, so I knew what was happening and knew I just had to wake my body up. Just all of the people yelling chip was weird, and pretty scary.",1
Kept hearing my mom enter my room while laughing,"I had a weird sleep paralysis where my eyes were closed but I could feel and hear everything else and I knew I was not fully conscious but all my senses were awake.

I heard my mom enter my room laughing and leave multiple times and I knew it wasn't her. Then I genuinely felt her walk around my bed, throw the blanket off my body, giggle in a high-pitched tone and throw the blanket back and leave.

I also keep feeling people jump onto my bed and rock it back and forth when I'm in sleep paralysis.",1
Why do I hallucinate for a split second every time I wake up?,"Sorry if this isn't the right sub for this, I wasn't sure where to post. For a few days now I have been seeing things for a split second after I wake up. It doesn't last very long but it is still very startling. Usually it's just weird shadows, but they've been getting worse, yesterday I saw a furby (??? lmao) and today I saw a weird scarecrow-like monster thing hovering over me. Both of these only lasted for a split second but they still really scared me. 

Is this just really short sleep paralysis? I'm very confused as to what this is, I can't really find anything about it on the internet. I don't have a family history of sleep paralysis and have never had any problems with hallucinating before this. Thank you for any help!",1
"I just discovered I've had recurrent sleep paralysis, and now I'm scared","Right around the time I was in the middle of my college education, I started to have these very strange dreams. Very often, about once or twice per week, I would ""wake up"" and just lay there, aware of my surroundings but unable to control anything.

The first time it happened, it felt like I was struggling for my life. I was facing down and on my side, and I was afraid of not being able to move my body ever again; what if I was in a comma? Is this what dying is like?

I ""powered through"" and woke up, only to immediately fall down again, as if I was blacking out and returning to that horrible limbo. After hours, I could finally stay awake. I ran out of the room and took a cold shower, I never wanted that to happen again. But it did.

You could say it got better. I learned to stay calm when it happened, and learned to focus my willpower, so to speak, and force myself awake, something that I've learned to do when dreaming in general, whether lucid or nightmares.

Now, after years, recent reading has made me believe I was suffering from, well, sleep paralysis. My only other experience with it was vague memory I had from when I was 7 years old, where looking back it happened and I saw a creature on top of me, but I never related these events because I never saw a creature again, not even during all of these episodes.

But now I'm scared shitless, because I've read the ""demons"" come from suggestions within the mind, and now that I'm aware of it I'm afraid they'll start appearing, which makes me anxious because I'm scared of being anxious of being scared. See where I'm going?

TL;DR: Just realized I've been having paralysis, demons never showed up, I'm afraid they will now that I know they should",1
A positive sleep,So I usually wake up and make my boyfriend breakfast before he goes to work and I go back to sleep after he leaves. He usually leaves by 6:40am. I have been working remotely so I sleep until I have work at 8am. I went to sleep around 6:45am. I started having layers of dreams. The first dream was a house party. Woke up at a random concert in LasVegas. Then woke up at six flags. So eventually my mind is awake and I am watching myself physically sleeping. I tried to move my body but for about ten seconds I couldn’t move. Nothing hurt. I wasn’t scared but I just thought I would share because I have never experienced anything like this. When I finally woke up I felt well rested and super interested in what happened to me.,1
My sleep paralysis experiences,"I have experienced sleep paralysis twice in my life.

The first time it happened, I was about 9 or so and sleeping in between my parents. I must’ve woken up in the middle of the night and quickly went back to sleep. I soon heard an evil laugh that I can only remember myself thinking sounded like a witch. I was freaking out because I couldn’t speak or move, and I remember trying so hard to scream. I woke up petrified. After that night, I never had this type of experience again.

Fast forward many years, I am now 20 and am a very spiritual/religious person. I’ve read a bit about astral projection and think it’s very intriguing. Recently, I woke up briefly in the morning (about 6 or so), and I recalled something I read on a reddit thread about having an easier time astral projecting right after waking up from a deep sleep. I closed my eyes and essentially just relaxed my entire body. Almost instantly I began to hear multiple people whispering. Their whispers were muffled, and I couldn’t interpret anything that was said. I got scared and instantly tried to wake myself back up. Again, I couldn’t move (& although I didn’t attempt to speak, I don’t think I could’ve if I tried). Luckily, I quickly woke myself up.

Thankfully, the second time around was not nearly as scary, and I didn’t have as bad of an experience. I honestly think I’m more intrigued about the whole thing, rather than scared. Overall, I’m posting this here to simply share my experiences and for others to share their thoughts, experiences, and knowledge on sleep paralysis, astral projection, their potential relation, etc!",1
my cat saved me from the sp demon,"ive had a few episodes of sleep paralysis, all involving this one very skinny tall ‘demon’. i usually have some hallucinations, people i know giggling and running around my room that will then transform into the demon that will creep around my bed and come stand next to me. ive never seen him above his legs. he usually just leans over me, standing there, freaking me the hell out. 
one night i experienced it again, the demon standing a bit further away from me except this time they were reaching out for me, slowly, slowly coming closer with his long boney hands. my cat, who sleeps with me, bit my leg REALLY hard. i ended up screaming and snapping out of it. the demon was gone and my cat was sleeping peacefully next to my legs. since then i havent had a single sp episode. i think he saved me that night.",1
Recently I have been closing my eyes and rolling them up to break out of sleep paralysis and begin lucid dreaming or out of body experience.,"I have only done this twice so far but both times it has worked.

When I roll my eyes up I start seeing colours colours, like when you run your eyes, every time I have done this the sleep paralysis stopped.",1
Parálisis de sueño 👏😞,"La fina línea entre lo real y las alucinaciones es inquietante , suelo ver personas pegadas en el techo cuando duermo boca arriba , no me asusta verlas de lejos pero hace poco me desperté y había un chico durmiendo en mi cama un  de cabello castaño claro y los ojos Completamente Negros  me asuste mucho y lo peor es que no podía moverme .. alguien más sufrió de este tipo de alucinaciones en una parálisis ?

Floating skull,So I opened my eyes it was around sundown because I saw an orange sky and the living room light poured into the dark bedroom through the hall and I remember trying to get up but I couldn’t. And I look up towards the door and I see this hideous face like a skull slowly creep up it was abnormally big and I began to cry and close my eyes as I felt it get closer and when it was up in my face I opened my eyes and tried to scream and it screamed instead and the stench was horrible as it taunted me dancing around my body until I closed my eyes for the last time and woke up finding a pleasant surprise I had just soiled the floor. (All of my sleep paralysis experiences Have been when I sleep on the floor wether I’m too tired to get up or I just don’t feel like going to bed).,1
I felt deaths cold embrace,"I would like to start off by saying this i my first time expirenceing something like this however I used to have and so.etime still do expirence night terrors and have since I was about 10. 

So I woke up not long ago at the time of wrighting this so it's still fresh, I woke up because I felt someone. Had come behind me and had wrapped there arm around me. At first I thought it was my girlfriend however due to her working at a hospital we haven't been able to see each other in a while and haven't been over each other's since the lockdown, I knew this couldn't be the case so I tried to open my eyes and look , they felt heavy but I managed to do so my room was dark with only the light from the sky leaking into my bedroom which was minimal at best as it is currently 3.45am at the time of writing. Then I thought maybe it was my little sister. She sees me as her father figure  and would sometimes come to my room when she had nightmares when she was between 1 and 4  however I was curious who it actually was I tried reaching behind me and I felt an arm however my eyes started to come adjust to the low light levels and I could then see that my arm was in front of me. I begung to realise whatever was behind me actually felt as cold as ice this was really unsettling. It felt as if death was embracing me from behind I couldn't move my whole body felt heavy. I thought as I've this was the end for me. I was tired still and I felt my eyes getting heavy again trying to close but in my head I thought if I do close them I won't wake up again. This struggle felt like it lasted for hours however in reality it probably only lasted a few minutes at best. 

I was finally able to move I had been trying to the whole time I turned over and saw no one. My first reaction was to message my gf I then began to write it out to post.

 I haven't felt this scared since I was a kid. I don't think I will go back to sleep tonight",1
"first ever experience, have questions","Today I had my first experience with what I believe to have been Sleep Paralysis, not 100% certain and am just hoping if I could get some details cleared out.

Essentially I was having a dream where I was sitting in an office building where the “President of Microsoft” was sitting across from me and offered me a job as the CEO of Microsoft. (very realistic i know, and i also think it’s worth nothing that i was well aware at this point that I was dreaming, I remember thinking it was funny that my salary was only going to be $17,000 a month.) Anyways after signing the paperwork and everything, the president disappeared and told me to do some accounting. This is when it happened, as soon as I sat down and picked up the pen I felt my shoulder and neck area being grabbed, I was lifted up and across from the mirror in front of me I saw a shadowy figure, probably 10 feet tall essentially crushing me, just holding me up and letting me watch my reflection. At this point the dream faded to static and i was back to reality where I was eyes open laying in bed and unable to move. Struggling with the immense pain and panic, I eventually hallucinated that I got up from bed and went to go call an ambulance, then a second later in a blink i was back in bed struggling with the paralysis again. I don’t really know what happened but eventually just like that I was able to move again and it was almost like the whole thing never happened.

Something I would like the note is that I also have some minor anxiety and have also experienced panic attacks recently aswell, and each of those things are new developments in my life. 

A few questions I have:

1. Does my description above represent what would be considered Sleep paralysis? A big detail about it is that not the whole thing took place in my room I was sleeping in, and just sort of felt like a nightmare carrying over to me being awake.

2. Is this a sign of my anxiety deteriorating? I’ve experienced a lot of new symptoms gradually and am wondering if this is just the next step of it.

3. A smaller question, but ive done a little research and i’ve found that people who’ve experienced this tend to be in sleeping conditions different than normal. For me I usually sleep on my side and at night, this happened when I slept on my back and during the day, so just curious as to if there’s any truth to that idea that different sleeping environments cause sleep paralysis.

I know this was a lot to read and wasn’t worded the best so I really do appreciate any help.",1
Just auditory?,"So, I don't experience sleep paralysis especially often, but the one more intense experience I had didn't actually have too much going on visually. I felt like I was waking up in the middle of a conversation I was already having, but after it happened I couldn't possibly tell you what any of the words were. I could hear whoever I was talking to and could tell from their inflection that they were angry, but couldn't see them even when I opened my eyes. Every time my eyes shut I'd see imagery of wild facial expressions, but if I opened them again, it'd fade out the way floaters do after you rub you eyes, but the voice didn't stop until I kept my eyes open long enough to the images to fade completely.

All this is just to ask, does anyone else have sleep paralysis stories that don't really have much of a visual element?",1
Becoming more intense?,"Over the past few years, I’ve had sleep paralysis episodes. I went through a few months where it was happening often, but it stopped for a while. Last night I had a really bad one and it felt more intense than before. 

Some of the ones I’ve had before:
I dreamt that I was driving and half my body went numb, starting with my right eye and then the whole right side of my body. I woke up and couldn’t move, and my eye was swollen for a little that morning. This was an early one so I figured probably allergies. 

The other ones were typical. Woke up couldn’t move felt like someone was watching but eventually got through it. The last one before this most recent one was me waking up from an uneventful dream with a shadow standing right over me. I heard these deep guttural moaning type of sounds and it felt like someone’s hand was moving up my thigh towards my underwear but at the same time just heavy pressure on my limbs and chest. The sexuality of that one really spooked me but it stopped for a while after that. 

Last night was terrible. At first I was stuck inside a nightmare and every time I would “wake up” I’d be stuck in a new one. I finally actually woke up and felt like my whole body was being held down. There was a shadow at the window that had the shape of a large man just staring in at me and the whole time I’m trying to scream for help but nothings coming out. My dog was barking at the shadow but I still was just stuck.  When I finally was able to move the shadow stayed there for a while, but I got up off the couch and it disappeared. 

The new part of this one (besides it being hella long) is I have small bruises on my arms and legs. Nothing big, but dime-sized super random bruises scattered on just my arms and legs? Idk considering seeking a medium or therapist at this point.

Anyone scream during SP where it’s actually audible?,"I had an episode two nights ago and I felt like I was screaming for a few minutes straight and I was calling out my partners name. I could hear him fumbling to turn on the light and then I realized he could actually HEAR me screaming. He said it was only for a few seconds, and that I never called out his name but part of my screams were actually audible? Has anyone else experienced anything like this?",1
Sleep Paralysis,"Hi, since I know what sleep paralysis is it has been one of my biggest fears so if I ever get it can anyone please share some tips with me to stay calm?",1
Really strange experience,"I’ve experienced SP since I was about 9 years old off and on, I started smoking weed about a year ago and haven’t experienced it since, until now. I’m taking a tolerance break from weed and the sleep paralysis has came back, but not as I remember it. Last night, I was sleeping on my friends sofa and started hallucinating him sitting there after he went to bed, about 10 minutes went by and a figure appeared with no features except a mouth. It pinned me down and started swaying back and fourth on top of me and then started screaming what felt like an inch from my face. All the usual SP symptoms of not being able to move, not being able to make any noise myself were all there like usual, I just find it strange that I was hallucinating my friend being there this time, which has never happened before. I usually share a room with my brother when I’ve experienced SP before so maybe it’s my brain trying to find a way to cope with this being alone? Any insight would be appreciated, thank you",1
Worse one yet,I didn’t no this was a group I didn’t even no what read it was up until a month or two ago. I been dealing with SP by myself for years and it’s only getting worse it comes and goes but wtf man I just got stuck (that’s what I call it anyway) and my girl usually wakes me but she was not around in the worse fucking dream and yelling and the hole 9 I don’t even want to go back to bed after this one. I am happy I found a group for this I’m going to check it out now for a long time no one ever new what I was dealing with shit the sleep doc didn’t believe me so I’m hoping I can find some people to relate to and hopefully you can get some useful tips and ways of dealing with this. I was so fuckkng upset my girl found me with my head down I fear sleeping alone for this reason,1
My 2nd Sleep Paralysis was actually not bad.,"I was asleep in my room when suddenly my eyes popped open. I was laying on my back (not good for sleep paralysis) and I looked over and saw my mom walking into my room. This was impossible because my door was locked and had a security bar on it. She was carrying something (I don’t remember what) and she said “My gosh, this room’s a mess. Where should I put this...?” I tried to say “put what where?” But I couldn’t speak or move. She then said “I’ll just put it here.” Set the item on my dresser and headed for the closed door. I tried to move my head to follow her out the door when my eyes popped open and my head was laying on its side staring at the computer screen, my door still shut and locked, and my alarm to get up about to go off. I didn’t have a sense of panic or shortness of breath this time so a much nicer experience then my 1st. Just wanted to share, thanks for reading!",1
I've been experiencing a series of SP for 3 years now.,"I really dont know if this is some paranormal shit or what so ever. I just want to know if there are people who are experiencing the same as me.

My first episode of SP started three years ago.  I just got home from night school and decided to take a sleep already. I just changed clothes, didnt even showered just straight onto bed. I remember on that moment when I instantly closed my eyes the SP just triggered. Usual feeling when having a SP which is, you can't move. As a first timer because of that I panicked and try to move as much as I can but I failed. I also tried to scream for help but my mouth wont just open. Feeling hopeless I just took a deep breath and started to relax and accept my death.I just suddenly realized that Im not ready to die yet and I tried to open my eyes. Thankfully I become awake and back to reality again. I was not able to sleep at that night because of that. 

After that it happens like every week for three months. Same shit. The only way I was able to wake up is taking a deep breath, relaxing my body and opening my eyes. Since that is what I do when I first experienced SP. Im not taking it as a big deal because maybe Im just stress from school works. Plus its already happening everyweek that I already get used to it. But those once a week becomes thrice a week and Im already getting annoyed and  frustrated because I cant sleep properly and Im also scared already.

Because of this onslaught episodes of SP. I cannot have a proper sleep anymore and my mind couldnt handle the sleepiness that I feel, so I my eyes just automatically closed and my mind suddenly react that I might have an SP again if I tried to sleep. Then, the SP triggered. It was like, I tried to woke up during the middle of going to sleep and it triggered. So I woke up and realized what just happened that maybe it is the reason why it triggers. I tried to do it at that same night and yes its truly the reason why the SP is triggered. So from that time I dont sleep right away. I close my eyes and relaxing my body and let myself fall asleep like automatically. 

The SP stopped like 2 months. And then another episode happened. It was during the middle my sleep. So I tried to use my old reliable method to wake up but this time its not working. I did it like 3-5 times still not working. I starting to panic already. So much panic that I was able to move forcefully. And when I say forcefully. Every move that I make it feels like my soul is getting torn apart from my body. It is so painful I cant even explain it. Its so painful that I can able to scream during sleep paralysis. During that phenomenon that is happening to me I just snapped and woke up. Feeling very exhausted and hurting my throat. Again I was not able to after that.

After a few days I tried the Waking up during the start of the sleep method which still works and I can still wake up using the ol reliable relaxing method that I always do. After a weeks it happened again during mid sleep. Waking up traumatized and exhausted again. Starting that time the SP episodes are happening like 3 times a week, a full week. It happens almost everytime that I got really used to it. Sometimes I can wake up using that relaxation method and sometimes not. But there is a time that I endured the pain of that soul ripping feeling during my SP. After that I was able to sit and I felt like my soul is out of my body. But I didnt opened my eyes because Im still scared and I just lay down right away again to wake up.

Up to now, Im still experiencing some random unexpected SP. Like maybe 100+ of them. Also, I was now able to sit up turn around and look at my own body lying down. Like I was astral projecting or something like that but I still need to take that soul ripping experience before going to that astral projection thingy.

So if there are some people out there that has the almost same experience like me. Please do share your stories. It will be very much appreciated to know that Im not the only one experiencing these kind of things.

P.S. Sorry if the my story is kinda messy. I did my best on explaining it as much as I can do. Thank you and no hate please.",1
[ENG] How I become friend with the Monster of my sleep paralysis,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

For people who remember me, I finally made the english version of my Website !

&#x200B;

For the other or as a reminder, like  a lot of people, I do sleep paralysis and a monster assaulted me in the  past. One time, he totally took the appearance of the Mind Flayer from  Stranger Things.

I  create a website to talk about how I discover that the monster, who was  assaulted me, is my  unconscious and how I become friend with him.

Today, during sleep paralysis or lucid dream, I can sometime talk to the Mind Flayer, like I can talk a real person.

I  discover that during those paralysis, the Mind Flayer was sending me  some messages to help me: sometime it was just a hug, one time he  punished me because I was mistreating my body, some to take some news  from me... I don't talk about demon, spirit, djin or call it as you  want. I talk about our unconscious. About us finally.

When  I discover all of this, I try to search testimonials about people who  can do like me. But I didn't find... Thereby, I decided to create a  website to find people like me and to help people with there sleep  paralysis. I don't try to make people talk to there unconscious like I do. I just want to help them to understand the messages of there unconscious.

Some  people who make a depression, can do sleep paralysis bound to this.  Sometimes, the psychologists analyze the sleep paralysis dreams to help  people.

With my experience with the Mind Flayer, I think if people can understand the messages of there unconscious, they can go ahead !

Personally, since I discover that the Mind Flayer is my unconscious, I never feel better before !

I'm happy, after all the work I do, to give you the english version. There's a french version too. :)

&#x200B;

 Here the link of my website. I gain no money and there's no ads. It's create to help people. Feel free to share the Website and like the Facebook page to follow the news ;)

&#x200B;

Nowadays, I only find one person who  can speak with his unconscious. One time, he dances with him, like I did  with the Mind Flayer too. Maybe it's the way to accept his presence ! And maybe it will be your turn one day ! :)

&#x200B;

Have a nice day !

Paranormal Experience or Sleep Paralysis?,"I'd like to preface this by saying I am not one to ever really experience paranormal activity. The closest thing to a paranormal experience I've had is hearing soft creaks in my childhood home.

I (f/25) am currently staying with my boyfriend in a small one-bedroom apartment. This morning around 7am, after my boyfriend left for work and I was alone in bed, some strange things happened. I was half-asleep but conscious and felt an undeniable presence in the bedroom. I subsequently felt pressure on the bed on my left side (I was sleeping on my side facing right) as if someone or something large had sat down on the bed right up next to me. I was scared and felt paralyzed knowing that I was alone and scared to look over to see what it was. After about two minutes I looked over and saw nothing.

Eventually I went back to sleep for a bit longer and again was awakened, though admittedly somewhat half-asleep. This time I heard the bathroom water running and the bathroom cabinet opening, as if my boyfriend had come back and was in the bathroom (he was not). Again I felt paralyzed by fear but this time it was worse. I felt my whole body freeze intensely and I was unable to move at all (could this be sleep paralysis?). When I opened my eyes and looked over the water and all noises stopped. After this I was so scared that I moved to the couch to sleep.

Though both instances scared me, I did not necessarily feel threatened or harmed. I should add that I was alone this whole time and I don't think this would have happened if I wasn't.

Not sure exactly what this was, or if it had anything to do with insomnia or sleep paralysis (neither of which I have had issues with in the past). I have never experienced anything like this before.

Any insight is tremendously appreciated.",1
Why does sleep paralysis cause anxiety? (As well as a warning about naps.),"Now, I get what you're thinking, ""Sleep paralysis is caused by anxiety."" That is true, but it is also true that Sleep Paralysis is called by this thing called a... ""nap."" Yes, a thing you decided to do when your brain wants some more of that precious thing we call ""sleep."" All of my SP experiences are triggered by naps, never, was a time it was caused by sleep. So, moral of the story: Don't take naps (But do if you really need it.)

Every SP experience I had wasn't scary, only annoying. I have to sit through buzzing sounds in my ear while my body feels like it is having the most uncomfortable massage. Oh, and if I try to move, the massaging gets harder. So it wasn't really scary, but here is a question... Why does SP cause anxiety?

I recently had a SP experience, it happened yesterday when I drifted off to sleep due to boring Terraria (a game) footage. Now, at certain times, I would be struck with sudden anxiety/paranoia. It is totally gonna ruin me going downstairs to the kitchen in complete darkness to fill up my water bottle. I can't do that anymore, Sleep Paralysis just makes me a total wimp!

TL;DR: I should not take naps because they cause SP, and can you tell me why SP causes me to have anxiety? Thanks!",1
My SP experience.,"Background: I am Male and I was 8 or 9 at the time.  I was terrified of FNAF. The one I hated the most and scared me was Springtrap. The fact that he is a walking corpse just terrified me.

It all started when I woke up from sleep and it was dark in my room so I assumed it was like 2 or 3. Then... I saw him. From the edge of my bed. Just staring at me. With my nightlight in place I knew it was Springtrap I could see his outline and his white soulless eyes locked onto me. Then he began to hobble toward me from the edge of my bed. That's when I realized I could not move. Then I tried to scream mom, I couldn't talk at all. As he came closer I heard muffled gurgle and static coming from him. Always never breaking eye contact. When he was halfway he stopped and then wound back and started sprinting. I've never been so scared in my life before that moment. Right as he was about to reach me I woke up so scared I got out of bed and litterly bolted to my parents room. I slept with them the rest of the night.",1

I had an SP episode last night and now I'm terrified to sleep,"I've had sleep paralysis episodes a lot over the years but they were usually just temporary and I was able to force myself to snap out of it and open my eyes because I knew it wasn't real. I was usually just unable to move and could see my ceiling above. I didn't have an episode for over a year till last night. I was very drowsy and I fell asleep and suddenly I saw ghost-like dark hands holding me down and I felt as though someone was on me. It felt like my legs were being held down as well and I couldn't move at all, I could just see my television in front of me. I was able to force myself to wake up after a minute. I was terrified for a few minutes but just brushed it off and watched something for a while and then fell asleep again. This time, I had a worse episode. I was sitting up straight and saw the same hands and felt like I was being pulled or sucked into something. This time I thought it was really happening and yelled out for my mother. It went on for about 5-6 minutes. I was yelling the entire time and trying to brush the hands off of me and escape. I didn't see any creature, just felt hands either on me or pulling me. I suddenly woke up sweating profusely and realized it was a dream. It felt extremely real though which is why I've been extremely shaken up. I've never experienced an episode of this sort before and I didn't even know it could get this petrifying. I've been anxious ever since and now I'm terrified to fall asleep because I fear it will happen again and I don't want to feel all of it again. I don't believe in supernatural beings or paranormal activity but when I searched this up I read some scary cultural folklore and made myself more frantic. I don't know what to do now I can't get myself to stop thinking about it and my anxiety is peaking.

Also, I was able to move a little bit to try and break free from the hands during the second episode which has never happened before. This was still SP, right? Or could it be something else? ",1
Does anyone feel drained of energy in the morning following the SP episode?,I had my 3rd episode last night (been a whole year since the last) and I’m feeling extremely lethargic. I had to drink coffee this morning (I don’t ever drink it) just to wake me up enough to work. Maybe it’s just mental exhaustion? I’m curious on how it effects others in the day following.,1
SLEEP PARALYSIS IN LUCID DREAM Very fucked up experience what from my SP’s started happening,"I actually don’t want to write about this
because my last theories had shown that the less I think about it the less I get SP. 
But I’ve literally in the past searched so much about SP and never found information I wanted. Now, I found this page..exactly what I was searching

July 2017
This time, I had never heard of sleep paralysis. I had never had any different sleep experiences than a normal dream. 

So just one day
I was staying at my grandmas where I always watch TV until midnight. About 3-4 at night I thought I’ll fall asleep now. :) My horrificest experience was about to start. I would describe it as a sleep paralysis in a lucid dream with hallucinations, voices and a total nightmare. Fell asleep at grandmas, in a “dream” I was at my home in my bed, firstly started flying to my living room from a hole in a wall where irl was no hole.., that was like a cool part from that.. what (idk how) turned into a very scary nightmare where I was again in my bed, lights were off now, I laid down and couldn’t move. I was alone. In my head was only one thought/hope- is my door locked. Seconds later I heard knocks at my door. I couldn’t move. Next I heard that someone opened my door :))) I was in my bedroom it was dark and a guy with a knife got in my house and started running towards me. I was just scared to death, wanting to run away, scream, call help, but I was totally paralyzed.😫Couldn’t move, thought I’m going to die he is going to stab me with his knife and kill me. 
To that exact moment when he was about 10cm from me, all this just started again.. I heard a door open, saw a guy with knife running to me, when about 10cm from me disappeared or sth and the circle started again with no pause... the circle ran about 7-8 times and it was the longest and terriblest minutes of my life. 
It was finally over and I woke up at my grandmas..TERRIFIED. 

So I literally had a lucid dream where I was at my home and could fly and what turned into a nightmare where I got sleep paralysis.. all this action in my dream took place at MY home, but I actually was sleeping at my GRANDMAS home, so... what was it!?!?! sleep paralysis? or lucid dream? or a regular nightmare(totally not!)? or hm just a regular dream? heheheheeell no. 
 
Has anyone any thoughts what it was? 

Also from that I started having regular SP’s for 3-4 times a month and every SP is about 10-20 seconds long. Have had a lot of interesting experiences on those what I may be sharing with you in the future  Seeing things, hearing things and feeling things, but not enjoying these :D 
From now, 3 years later I have them pretty under control and even know when they are coming and can stop them before get them. 

But yeah, that was my experience :) I remember it like it was yesterday although it was 3 years ago 

Sorry about bad english tho, struggled a lot to write this",1
Did I have sleep paralysis and a nightmare at the same time?,"So this will sound weird but last night I think had a bad dream, that turned into sleep paralysis, that then went back to being a dream.

Basically I fell asleep and I remember dreaming about a shadowy figure standing over my bed. But it felt like I was watching it happen from above as if I was watching a video of it happening instead of experience it. I didn't feel lucid at this point.

Then my perspective returned to me laying in bed and I was facing the wall (my bed is in the corner of the room) and I could feel something trying to drag me out of bed with a lot of force. I couldn't move but I remember one of my hands gripping the side of the bed to keep me in place. I felt lucid at this point. I felt awake.

Then my perspective changed again and I was standing the middle of my room I couldn't see any shadow figure or other SP type thing. But I could sense some sort of presence in my room that I appeared to be physically fighting with and I eventually managed to push out of my room. I want lucid during this I just experienced it. Like you would in a regular dream.

Then my perspective shifted back to being in bed. I felt awake, lucid, relaxed and didn't feel as if anyone else was there and swiftly drifted back to sleep.

So was this experience just a dream? Was some sort of sleep paralysis? Or was it a mixture of both?",1
Scared to sleep tonight because of last night's SP episode,"I have always had trouble sleeping, and I almost never go a night without dreaming. Many times my dreams are very vivid, sometimes lucid. The majority of the time they are really out there, and more often than not they are unpleasant or full-on nightmares. I have had my fair share of episodes which I associate with SP. I had another one last night. Each time one happens, the best way I can explain it to my husband is that it doesn't feel at all like a dream- it feels like it's really happening. In last night's, I was startled ""awake"" by the sound of our bedroom door being opened. The sound ""woke"" my husband as well and even though our room was totally dark, I could just make out 2 figures entering the room. One of them began walking over to my side of the bed while the other remained on my husband's side, although both entities were focused on me. My husband was unable to speak but was pointing at them with a horrified look on his face. I was immediately struck with fear watching them get closer to me, and at first I could only manage to mutter ""NO, NO, NO!"" Could not move my body once I saw that they were there.Their eyes seemed to reflect a tiny amount of light from somewhere and although it was much too dark to make out any features, they did appear human-like (but definitely malicious, demon-like.) The more I muttered ""NO"" they began basically crawling on top of me. That's when I used every bit of courage I could muster to start reciting The Lord's Prayer. Even though the words came out weak and slow, with each new word the entities began screeching loudly and became frantic in trying to stop me. Once I reached the end of the prayer and said ""Amen"" I woke up. According to my husband, I was whimpering, twitching and muttering words in my sleep, which woke him up. He began rubbing my arm and after a while I got quiet. That's about the time I remember waking up and not knowing if I was REALLY awake this time or not. Each time I have experiences like this, I am so tired and just ""zapped"" the next day.",1
Never had it,I had sp for the first time in my life. I’m 20 and just recently got my last wisdom tooth taken out and they put me on a bunch of pills and one of them were oxycodon (Percocet) I’ve never been a drug user growing up and especially not now since I’m in the military. They took out my tooth on Friday and Saturday afternoon after I ate lunch I took all my pills and they put me to sleep. I remember waking up and opening my eyes and looking at my body and I couldn’t move. Then a little girl walks in and just walks up next to me after she stops next to me and turns to me I snap out of it. It’s weird considering the fact I’ve never had this happen before but is it normal for this to happen if I’m drugged out like I was? I don’t remember because scared or terrified when I saw that little girl walk in I just remember wanting to snap out of it which I did. Also I live with another marine who I would never mistake for that little girl.,1
My Strange experience Ft. Ronald McDonald,"I had a really weird sleep paralysis last night, I have a chair by my bed and when I opened my eyes there was like a burnt zombie Ronald McDonald in grey tattered clothes. Normally I don't hear things but last night I did, it spoke to me and explained that Ronald McDonald is actually a demon named Nosferatu, (Thats actually Bram Stoker's Dracula), and the reason McDonald's is so wildly popular is the original owners sold their souls to him, and that all the McDonald's statues are idols built for him 

It was really weird but an almost plausible story",1
just a question,what's the most common thing people see/hear/feel during sleep paralysis?,1
Sudden change in SP,"Hey! Now I've had sleep paralysis almost all my life up to this point. I just seem to be very prone to sleep paralysis for some reason. It's always actually not been that bad. What I mean, is that I never experienced any hallucinations, buzzing, shaking, etc. Almost all my life my sleep paralysis was literally just temporary paralysis. I could hear what was going on around me, I'd usually have my eyes open and not see anything aside from what was actually going on around me. The only thing was literally just the paralysis that would last no more than a minute. This all changed late last year. I woke up in sleep paralysis but it was so much different this time. I felt such intense shaking, I could feel myself vibrating. I was hearing so many things: buzzes, voices, ringing. My eyes were darting all over the place. And then all of a sudden I'd just snap out of it and be all sweaty. Naturally, I was terrified. I'd experienced sleep paralysis so many times before that I had gotten used to it but never something like this. And it'd just keep randomly happening whenever I'd drift off to sleep. It hasn't happened since we moved out of the house it happened in. I'm just confused. Why did it just start becoming so violent? My sleep paralysis had never been that bad before.",1
Black and White vision?,I generally see the room in black and white when I experience sleep paralysis. I saw the girl from the ring coming out my tv. It all ended when i felt something tap my foot 3 times and i woke up. Does anyone else see the room theyre sleeping in in this detail? Thats not the first time something has tapped my foot to wake me up but thats for another post probably.,1
"Is this a sleep paralysis thing, or should I go see a sleep specialist?","Every blue moon, as I'm trying to fall asleep, I'll be rudely awakened by what I can only describe as a full on attack of the senses. I will see flashes of silver light, and it's combined with very loud metallic blaring siren sounds that sync up with the flashes. While this happens, I can also taste a metallic flavor in my mouth, too. It's very stressful, but it seems to also be connected to sleep paralysis, because when it happens I can't quite wake myself out of it and I'm kind of stuck in this very loud, very bright audiovisual loop for a while. Eventually I do wake up, but it starts again when I fall back asleep. So when this does happen, it makes me nervous to go back to sleep, and I often lose a few hours of sleep those nights.

Like I said, it doesn't happen often, maybe once every few years. But it's still something interesting that I want to learn more about, so if anyone has any leads on what this might be called or if it's normal, that would be helpful! Thanks!",1
3 hours of SP,"Last night I got off my pc to go to bed around 11:30,I was laying there watching a video and started to get a little tired around 12. I started to doze off and I though I had fallen asleep until I felt the usual SP feeing. My whole body was numb but also tingly, I felt pressure all over my body. I laid there waiting for it to get over, I can usually pull myself out of it and go back to sleep but this time was way different. Once I could feel I was coming out I was awake, I reached for my phone still half asleep, to check the time, 15 min had gone by since I set my phone down, and once my head hit the pillow I felt it pulling me back in. This kept going on for 3 hours, fighting to wake up and shake it off but every time I was close, I would be awake enough to open my eyes and move just a little, fighting it, I would get pulled back in again, and again. I was able to check my phone a couple times during this long episode. I was finally able to pull myself out of it. I got up to walk around and get some water but when I got to the bathroom I looked in the mirror and my eyes were both bloodshot and my body was shaking. This was the worst I have ever had it, usually just one or twice a night but this was terrible.",1
Any similar experience?,When i SP i have the usual yes answers ears ringing can’t talk etc. but one no one else seems to mention is that my body also like cringes in a sense like all my muscles are contracting into the fetal position. I manage to move as i just had my second SP and was able to make it downstairs where it stopped twice during it. Any thoughts on this?,1
I had sleep paralysis and I think my dog knew it.,"I've had sleep paralysis nearly all my life. I know you can't really tell what's real and what isn't while you are in sleep paralysis, but something weird happened. I was taking a nap in the afternoon and I had to get up soon. (that's when I'm most likely to get sleep paralysis). I was hearing and seeing things like one does in sleep paralysis. I think I tried to shout and then y felt my dog jump on the bed and lean close to me. It felt as if he heard me shouting in the sleep paralysis dimension. When I woke up he was indeed cuddling with me. I know this is crazy and impossible and most likely it was a hallucination, but it felt like he could see something was wrong.

Anyway, thought I might share",1
So I think I experienced sleep paralysis for the first time last night,"So just for some context, I'm currently 17 years old and have never experienced anything like this at all. I was never even made aware of this type of thing before I spoke about it to a friend earlier and he said it could have been sleep paralysis, I would just like to get some thoughts on this and any advice as to how to prevent this type of stuff from reoccurring would be amazing if possible.

I can't exactly remember what I was dreaming about prior to the incident, but I know it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. The last thing I can remember before waking up with complete clarity was this human like figure with absolutely no facial features what so ever under my bed sheets, practically face to face with me chanting these nonsensical phrases at me right until the moment I woke up. It only lasted a maximum of 5 minutes but when I awoke I was in cold sweats and completely out of breathe, never been this paranoid in my life and haven't slept since this incident. Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read.",1
Weird dreams and weird stuff happening,"

So lately i’ve been dreaming about pretty weird stuff, i cant remember everything of course but im going to try to explain it to the best of my ability.

About 1 week ago i started dreaming more often amd i could remember them clearly when i woke up, but after about 2 days, some consistencies turned up, at the end of the dream i would start hearing weird noises. This of course didnt bother me until 2 days ago, when i woke up very early (about 6 in the morning) and the sound was still there, i jumped out of bed and turned on the lights and noticed that my window cover (a sliding cover since my roof is slanted) was pretty much wide open, my window is right under a street light so i ALWAYS close it because i need complete darkness to sleep. When i jumped up and turned on the lights in my room, the sound immediately stopped, its hard to explain the noise but it sounded like the flapping of a piece of clothing against the window. Im pretty sure that shouldnt have happened because thats my only window and there is never any draft in my room. I decided to just go downstairs and forget about it since i was probaply still just half asleep. 

This is where it got weird

I have a little decorative captain America shield on the desk in my room, which is next to the door (this is important for later) i started dreaming normally (superpowers and stuff) until i somehow got back to my home in my dream and in my dream i sat down behind my desk with the door open, when i look out of the door from my desk, i can see closet doors from across the hall, in my dream i remember that i start to fall asleep behind my desk and i could see out of the corner of my eye that the closet door started to open, when i looked up and blinked, it was all normal again, this happened once more. But the third time i looked up and the closet door kept opening. So i got scared and threw the captain America shield at the closet door (<- in my dream not irl for as far as i know) and then i jumped up out of my bed, scared. When i turned on the lights at, again 6 in the morning, the shield was gone and lying on the floor next to me, i was VERY sure the shield was still on my desk when i went to sleep.

Any clue to how this couldve happened?

I’ll add updates if i get more weird dreams.",1
Advice for helping with SP? New to this.,"SP is new for me, it started a few months back and has become more regular as time has gone on. Probably due to the fact I work in a stressful job which requires shift working. It's starting to make me have difficulties going to sleep and I'm not resting properly which is starting to impact my work as I've been occasionally sleeping through my alarm for my early shifts. I am in the process of trying to get medical help as well but with the current situation with COVID it's taking a while and I'd rather find more therapeutic ways of dealing with it in case they're not too helpful or simply suggest meds to help me sleep or help with what they think is the cause.

I was wondering if anyone has advice on how to make this as easy as possible?

I've looked on the net but always feel it's best to ask people that actually experience it.

Oh just to save time, I'm a MH Nurse so I am already trying methods to alleviate the stress and the anxiety I feel sometimes, such as mindfullness etc. So I'm more looking for how to come out of it easier or how to try and prevent episodes other ways.

Edit: Also no advice to do with the supernatural please. I am not a believer that sleep paralysis is connected with paranormal happenings.",1
Location where Sleep Paralysis is most common?,Hi all doing research for a current project. Curious if there's a location or town in America where Sleep Paralysis has been oddly common or most prominent?  Or have any of you found others in your town all having weirdly similar experiences?,1
Hypnagogic hallucinations and am I going to get sleep paraparalysis,Lately I’ve been hearing these voice like hallucinations in my head where my coach and teammates are practicing and yelling whenever I’m falling asleep. Before that I’ve been hearing screeching noises like on that barrier of falling asleep. Last night I stayed up scared I was gonna have sleep paralysis should I be worried?,1
First instance of lucid dreaming while sleep paralysis,"Hi yall. Been having sleeping paralysis ever since the start of coronavirus. At first it was bad, but its not as scary as before. I think it stems from my constant marijuana use and irregular sleep pattern (id sometimes fall asleep in living room with tv for a couple hours around midnight, wake up, smoke weed, then stay up for another couple hours before finally sleeping.

This post isnt about my problems with sleep paralysis, but rather, how i could use it to my benefit. Last night was the first time i lucid dreamt. I had napped from 12-2am then napped from 3-5am. I took a bong rip when i awoke, and tried to go back to sleep at 5:30,  i had a felt a strong pulsating in my head while i was in bed until i finally ignored it and just slept.

At this point, i had falllen asleep and had been transported to a place that looked like the kitchen in 'Family Guy'. Id looked at my hands and was so amazed to see how clear everything was. And across from the kitchen table in my 'family guy' reality was my older brother who told me i was lucid dreaming. I then imagined myself floating, and next thing you know, i was floating.

As i was floating, and overwhelming sense of excitement and disbelief came through me. I couldnt believe i was finally lucid dreaming! And i wasnt even trying! I got so excited, that i woke myself up into a sleep paralysis episode, sadly ending my dream.

So my question is, how do I obtain this state again? I know that ill probably end up napping and end up putting myself in a state of sleep paralysis, but how i do go immediately to lucid dreaming?

Thanks",1
What have been some of your craziest sleep paralysis experiences and how do you handle them?,"I’ve been seeing random post about this so I wanted to share my experience, specifically with “the shadow man”. 

I’ve had sleep paralysis as young as I can remember. My first memory of sleep paralysis was with 3 shadows standing around me as if they were examining me and talking about me. I was about 5?? Since then I’ve learned how to control it and have had some cool experiences out of it, like making myself elevate from my bed during the paralysis. This past year I had my first encounter with this “shadow man”. When I went into sleep paralysis and saw him I thought “Oh shit! This is the shadow figure I’ve heard everyone talk about!” 

I decided to confront it and yelled “WHAT DO YOU WANT?!” And felt my soul come out of my body as I pushed him back towards the door. Then for a split second I got scared and all of a sudden I was “back in my bed” and the shadow man was standing right over me, next to my bed. This is when I freaked out a little and made myself get out of this paralysis. 

The next time I had sleep paralysis I scanned my room to make sure he wasn’t there and he wasn’t. I then started getting this bad feeling creeping in, as if he was about to appear. Then the craziest thing happened. Not me, but an inner voice said ”I’m the daughter of Jesus and I’m protected”.  After that I felt calm and then I just woke up from the sleep paralysis like WTF. I was raised Christian but I don’t affiliate myself with the church and would consider myself spiritual. 

I’d love to hear about your thoughts on sleep paralysis as well as experiences!",1
Sleep Paralysis every week,"I’m curious about how often people get sleep paralysis. I will experience it multiple times a month. I could have sleep paralysis three times in a week or none in two weeks, but I will always have had it multiple times on a month. It has been years since I’ve seen any figures while having sleep paralysis. My experiences are now usually just the physical inability to move or speak whilst falling into sleep or waking from a nightmare. 

I’m sure everyone has experienced that struggle while trying to wake up from sleep paralysis. The initial sensation when you finally “break free” is just pure exhaustion, and there have been times when I’ve snapped out of one episode just to pass out afterwards and fall into a second sleep paralysis session or even a third. Lately I’ve developed the ability to force air in and out of my mouth whilst paralysed, making a sort of snorting noise. It’s usually loud enough to wake my girlfriend and she knows to shake me awake once she hears that noise. She’s gotten me out of so many sleep paralysis episodes and I’m super grateful. 

So, does anyone else experience anything similar to me? I’m so curious to find out.",1
HELP! (Cant find anything on the internet),"I want to start off by telling y’all a little about myself.
So I’m a pretty light sleeper, I always going to sleep at all hours of the night. When I try to sleep early I end up waking up in the middle of the night not being able to sleep anymore.

I also am a very lucid dreamer. A lot of times I am aware that I am just dreaming and am able to “control” my dreams. I also have had the exact same dreams a few times. Also, I tend to be able to remember my dreams when I want. 

Like I had mentioned earlier I a very light sleeper right, well there’s only been a few times that I have entered a very deep sleep. Or at least that I’m aware of.  I used to think they were just heavy dreams. But after what happened this week I’m not so sure. 
Let me explain two things. 1)The past “deep sleep” 
2) what happened this week.


1) deep sleep- so I usually wake up with any small sound, even the sound of the water dripping off the bathroom faucet.  But these few times, my body was immobilized. My legs felt so so heavy! & I couldn’t feel my arms.. when my husband would wake up he would start talking to me and I could eventually hear everything he was saying . But I actually didn’t want to fully wake up. Because when I was like this, immobilized it was the only time I got some fucking decent sleep/ rest! So I zoned him out and slipped back into my dream. (Still immobilized) 

Iv always knew of sleep paralysis. The reason I don’t initially think these were sleeping paralysis is that everywhere I read or hear about it, they say it’s scary. But those times were not scary at all they were actually quite blissful. Everyone describes sleep paralysis like someone is on top of their chest. They feel like someone or something is watching them. For me, it wasn’t like that. At least not those times...


2) a few days ago, I went to bed like every other night. Except for this time In the middle of the night, I woke up and realized that yet again my body was immobilized. And like I actually like this, I closed my eyes and went back to sleep.  Then what I assume were some hours passed & I woke up again. Except for this time I was scared. I wasn’t terrified but I was scared . & I felt like right next to me (leveled)  there was a man's face looking right at me. I actually can’t remember his face exactly but I remember he was just inches away from my right hand.

A few things were different here from other times. I couldn’t fully wake, (I was actually trying). I couldn’t fully open my eyes either .... but after what felt like were minutes I got more annoyed than scared and physically swatted his face away.. I weakly lifted my hand and swatted where he was and he disappeared. Just like that. I then proceeded to slip back to my peaceful dream, still fully aware of what had happened. I later woke up still immobilized but will full control of my eyes and mind. Not wanting to stay in bed I was able to get up as nothing had happened.


I'm curious if this was actually sleep paralysis or something else. I can't find anything on google of slipping in and out of ""sleep paralysis"" so if anyone has anything please let me know! :)",1
My first sleep paralysis experience,My first experience was almost a year ago today. I was 16 years old and I was laying down on my back to go to sleep which I normally don’t do and all of a sudden I realize I can’t move and I feel a pressure on my chest pushing harder and harder and I started to panic. I tried to yell for my sister but I couldn’t speak. Then I heard these demon like noises screaming at me from all around (loud noises are one of my biggest fears) and I couldn’t cover my ears. I finally jerked awake. I realized that I had sleep paralysis and I looked up what caused it and it said sleeping on your back could cause it so I tried to go back to sleep on my side and it happened again. I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.,1
Very Strange Experience,"Now I haven't had a sleep paralysis episode in years, but last night kinda gave me a curve ball. I was laying down imagining a senario for a dream. I had a video playing in the background for white noise. As I thought harder about it I could feel my body simulating it. (Feeling touching sensation and whatnot) but I wasn't asleep yet. Then I noticed I started breathing wierd, like I was snoring. And when I tried to correct it nothing happened, couldn't close my mouth, move my legs ECT. Then I just rode out my paralysis till I could move again. Couldn't go back to sleep for the rest of night.",1
SP or something else at Airbnb stay.,"I was staying at a Airbnb just outside of Portland, and well I had a experience I will never forget. I was sleeping this blue lady was standing right next to my bed, but when I opened my eyes she was gone, but when I would lay down again and close my eyes she was back. Funny thing is I could still remember her expression on her face and what she was wearing. She looked angry, possibly disappointed, and wearing clothes from the 1800’s possibly early 1900’s. This happened three or four times before I finally just sat in bed till morning, freaking out.
It’s been almost a year now and I have no way to explain this, any help at explaining this event to me would be great.
Forgot to add that I could see through the blue lady as well.",1
Baby with SP?,"I used to have sleep paralysis every night. I’ve seen mostly shadow figures watching me as I lie there, stuck. However, there were two occasions where I have seen a demon with yellow eyes observing me and the room I was in. I recently had a baby and since he was born I haven’t had an episode of SP. I have noticed, however, that my baby will cry or whine in his sleep. I guess I’m afraid that maybe my SP demons left me and are now toying with my 8 month old baby.",1
White flash of light,"I’ve had many terrifying sleep paralysis episodes that have happened to me through the years that progressively seemed to evolve from seeing to hearing then actually feeling things. This episode was different from the others... I fell asleep in the afternoon after a stressful day at work and when I “woke up” I immediately knew I was having sleep paralysis. You already know It’s pointless to struggle since you can’t do nothing in that state other than look around but for me when I attempt to struggle this eerie beep that gets louder the more I “struggle” comes and it absolutely terrifying. Any ways as the sound was blaring in my ears I actually could feel myself moving in my paralysis and the beep was so loud it actually hurt, and at this moment I hear my father walking in the hall way talking on the phone and in my head I’m calling out for him cause this is actually the most terrifying thing I’ve experienced, I started to struggle more and as I felt like I lifted my upper body up (imagine a sideways floor push) a bright light flashed in my face IMMEDIATELY knocking me out and I woke up in a sweat and I remember it all vividly I know it happened and I don’t know if anyone else has experience such a thing.. might tell the other stories of my weird experiences",1
What is this thing,"So I’m still shaken up about this because all of this happened within the last hour and I just needed and explanation or someone’s opinion or something to calm myself down I guess.

So for some context I have been able to sense spirits for a while now. I used to live on an old burial ground when it first started. In my dads house we always talked about a ghost named Poline because that was the name of the previous resident that lived and died in the house. I always grow up with door knobs rattling being a normal thing right along with feeling like I wasn’t along being completely normal. Poline wasn’t a bad spirit. She was more like a guardian of the house and she had a very kind and pure soul that could be felt but I never saw her.

When I first started seeing and feeling spirits it was just the typical black silhouette that people tend to say they see out of the corner of their eye, but for me I could see them if I move to look right at them too. After a few years the feeling of this safe and warm presence that I came to know as Poline ended up disappearing and in its place I could feel two new presences. One was that of a middle aged man that lived in the basement but that would also walk around upstairs and knock on the walls. The other was that of a small girl that lives in the room separated by my bedroom by a curtain but she also hangs out in the attic. The attic has always scared me.

 So tonight I was sleeping and normally I can sleep really well. I usually wake up once or twice but that could be just to fix my pillows or to situate clothing that got too tight. Tonight I woke up at exactly 3:11 because my old dog that I’ve had for as long as I can remember started to bark. This dog, Shaina, and I grew apart over the past few years because my parents went through a divorce and I stayed with my mom for a long while. This being said, she almost never slept in the same bed with me and if she ever did then she left as soon as I started to pet her.

So I placed my hand on her rear and rubbed the fur to try and calm her down so I could go back to sleep and she laid down so I fell asleep really easily. At 3:18 I heard this weird deepish voice saying something like “You hear us” and other things similar to that. At first I thought it could be my dad because he wakes up really early for his job but then I realized that the voice was almost right beside me. My dad doesn’t stay in my room in the mornings if he ever even comes into my room so I opened my eyes right as the clock on my desk read 3:19. I figured I was hearing things so I went back to sleep while petting my dogs back legs.

I didn’t find it weird at the time but when I was telling my friend about this just a few moments ago I realized that all of my blankets had come completely off except for my one thin one. I’m not a person that kicks my blankets off unless it’s really hot and I’ve got an AC unit that points right at my bed so I know I wasn’t hot.

So after I fell back asleep I felt that something was near me but I didn’t know what because it was something I had never felt in my house before. At around 3:37 or 3:38 I heard the voice again but it was almost right beside my ear this time. I woke up and looked around my room but as I did I saw this weird old man in my room. He was thin and was balding slightly and it looked like he was wearing either an old sleeping gown or a mental ward robe. It was very obvious that he was extremely dirty and he was hunched over a lot. Right as my eyes had opened he screamed “You can hear us” and ran down the hallway while giggling to himself.

The entire second encounter with this old man happened in just a few short seconds but it felt like it lasted longer minutes. After he ran down the hallway I noticed that I felt like I couldn’t breath. I sat up in a fit and started to breath extremely heavily. I thought I was going to scream. I urged myself to scream but nothing would come out. Just short, shaky, deep breaths.

I’ve been awake now for about an hour since that happened and I can hear things getting moved around my kitchen. My dad listened to what I had to say but he doesn’t believe in the supernatural so I know he doesn’t really believe what I’m saying. So I was just hoping for some closure or maybe I’m hoping someone can explain what that thing was cause I don’t know if I can sleep again tonight.",1
Sleep Paralysis... or something different?,"*Excuse the formatting, I’m on mobile*

I have experienced sleep paralysis many times throughout my life, it used to be a somewhat regular occurrence a few years ago. However, what I experienced last night was something very different. 

I used to have a LOT of issues sleeping a few years ago, but it has gotten so much better since my boyfriend and I moved in together about a year and a half ago. My night terrors and sleep paralysis pretty much went away completely, except for maybe a couple of episodes here and there. 

Last night, I experienced something that felt like sleep paralysis, but not... I woke up not being able to move, but I felt like I was physically being moved. I was sleeping towards the center of our bed but as I was waking up I felt like I was being pulled toward the edge. It was the most bizarre and terrifying feeling - especially since I myself wasn’t able to move. After a few moments I was able to move again and quickly moved back to my previous position and eventually went back to sleep. I then proceeded to have extremely vivid and horrific night terrors for the rest of the night. 

I guess I’m still a little freaked out about it all because I can’t explain what happened. Part of me thinks that I was just dreaming, but another part of me just doesn’t know. 

Has anyone had a similar experience with sleep paralysis or know what else it might be?",1
"Got sleep paralysis twice, one was during a dream.","Typing this at midnight in my place. I remember that I was looking at a box of a HG sized Gundam model box, I took out the RPG weapon that was said to be a pen according to the box, but I felt that the pen was too small for my hand to write, despite the dimensions looking big. 

Then out of nowhere, I 'woke' up with my face on my phone screen, which was displaying an image of a Gundam head in yellow and black colour, then I started to feel drowsy. I tried to pry off my face on the phone but to no avail, this is when I realized I'm having sleep paralysis.

But that's not the end. After freeing myself, I woke up, and felt my whole body was unable to move. About 30-45 seconds, I finally retain control over my body, it was not until that I realize I was dreaming all along, considering that my phone is not next to me, but on the ground.

Truly felt that I was inside the Matrix, when laws of dimensions don't exist and myselg unable to unplug from the dream world. Does anybody have  similar experiences like me?",1
Does anyone else have this?,I get a 15-45 second sleep paralysis episode every two to three weeks and I don’t really get nightmares it’s usually when I’m face down on a pillow and can barely breathe I’m always scared I might start suffocating and my body won’t wake up because I’m already partially wake,1
First experience,"My first experience with sleep paralysis was a few years back and it was terrifying. I was sleeping on a couch and my face was against a cushion so I couldn't see anything, but I could here a loud scrapping noise like the sound of pyramid head cleaver scrapping against floor.",1
Is there any way to force myself or guarantee that I'll experience sleep paralysis?,0,1
Some green person hiding,"First I was dreaming about metal slug and the dream turned into some call of duty zombies and I saw a zombie that’s not even in the game and that’s when my sleep paralysis started I woke up and I couldn’t even move and that weird creature I saw was hiding behind my tv peeking and staring at me it had black eyes and white dots and I knew what was up and I closed my eyes and I think I made it worst because I started hearing some really loud noises inside my head, and I thought I was safe inside my eyes but then, I saw that creature’s head quickly approaching me like a jump scare and and when it hit me I woke up",1
I think I'm in trouble.,I was about to go into sleep paralysis but I was still about 90% conscious so I was able to escape it before it really begun. But now I think my sleep paralysis demon is gonna be mad because I basically just rejected his invitation.,1
Sleep paralysis attacks?,"First off let me tell you about my sleep paralysis. I get it every 2 months about just randomly and for me I am fully awake and conscious like I am not seeing any demons or scared or anything. But the pressure is so immense on me, and my body is so like out of my control that I can’t breathe. So I’ll feel as if I’m suffocating which is awful until my body wakes up which can take quite a bit and I have to like manually do it by slowing gaining control of my hand. But anyways this makes my sleep paralysis overwhelmingly awful to go through every times but i have these really weird like “attacks” I guess you could call them. Basically they’re these like 30 minute periods where I am really tired and as I attempt to fall asleep I get sleep paralysis but once I snap out of it I have the least amount of energy I’ve ever had in my entire life. Like my body and mind just can’t be awake any longer so I fall back asleep and go straight into sleep paralysis and I’ll do this like 20 times over a 30 minute span until I finally can force myself to get out of bed. It only happens when I’m extremely tired in the first place like the only times it ever has happened is when I try to take naps during the day because I’m exhausted. It’s pretty rare too like it didn’t happens to me until like 2 years ago and I’ve probably been through it like 4 times but it’s so terrible when I do. My last one also got way worse than usual because I started falling asleep and waking up so much while being conscious through it all that my slivers of actual dreams i had were blending into my reality which scared me. And I don’t know if this is common or like if I’m literally the only person this happens and if it had a name or anything. But please let me know your thoughts or if this has ever happened to you",1
Most vivid SP hallucination,"I’ve dealt with SP for many years, most of my life actually (22F) and in all this time I’ve never had a hallucination this vivid and uncomfortable. 

Normally, I only get some slight auditory hallucinations. Like hearing voices talking to me, laughing, etc. Or, some very minor visual hallucinations like shadows in the corners or seeing things move under the blankets next to me. 

Anyway, one night I had the most intense hallucination I ever had and I can’t stop thinking about it. I was in that state where you kind of “wake up” and you realize your have sleep paralysis because you can’t move or speak. But then, I heard rustling at the foot of my bed. It sounded like someone was looking through bags on the floor or something. As I’m trying to shake myself out of my state of paralysis though, I see a dark figure slowly rise up at the foot of my bed and this dude was TALL. Then, I feel it start to crawl into the bed next to me and get closer to me. Once that figure is next to me, I feel like a snout rustle around my hair in the back of the head and the sound and feeling of it sniffing, like a dog would. 

I’ve never had full contact with one of my hallucinations before and never have actually felt it make contact with me.  It was a wild time for sure.",1
Sleep Paralysis or Abduction?,"I've experienced sleep paralysis for about 8 years now. But my worst experience was probably the first time.  

I had gone to bed after a day of holiday shopping and video games. Nothing abnormal. It was maybe around 2-3 when i woke up because i felt like something was off. I realized I couldnt move, and started to panic. Maybe 2 seconds later a bright light flashed thru my window and i felt like what was electricity running thru my head. All i heard was this very low but loud humming. 

I also felt like my whole bed was being lifted but at the same time I was being pushed down into it like a magnet. 

Then just as fast as it came on. It felt like i fell back onto the bed. And i was able to move. I wasnt able to sleep at night for about a week after that.

I just want to know if anyone has ever experienced anything like that with SP. Especially the electricity part",1
first time having it,"Keep in mind I was only a kid and for some reason, I wouldn't want to go back to sleep until the sun was shining.

I wake up and realized I couldn't move, it was hard to breathe and my chest felt heavy, I was very confused until I heard a literal child/baby laughing right into my ear, it echoed, 3-7 seconds after that I could move and I'm not sure if this was a coincidence or not but in my kitchen doorway there was a dark shadow-like figure with a tall thin head waving with long fingers. This was the first time I slept on the sofa and I will never do it again. I also had nightmares of it. My mum didn't believe it so I kept it to myself as i thought nobody else would believe me. (I was a very dumb child)",1
Is SP related to location?,"I grew up in the UAE and I remember I used to get SP when I was younger but I dont remember much about the episodes. I moved to Canada in 6th grade and returned to the UAE in the 9th grade but those years I spent in Canada, I never had a sleep paralysis episode. However, when I moved back, I had several SP episodes and many of them were really creepy. 

I moved back to Canada for college and I have only had one sleep paralysis episode in my first year in dorms, but nothing since (Im gonna start my third year this September). Even when I visit the UAE for like Christmas or Summer break, I would have some SP episodes, but never in Canada (other than that one time). 

Has anyone else had this experience? Maybe not in different countries but different houses or cities? Its really weird to me, what do you guys think?",1
Speaking an unkown language while sleep paralysis,"I remember last night when I had the most confusing sleep paralysis ever. When I sleep I listen to youtube videos until I fall asleep. And when I had my sleep paralysis I remember listening to some techno futuristic ish music. My sleep paralysis demon didnt come but some kind of a futuristic soldier that resembled a pilot from titanfall. He had a gun and interogated me in some language I had never heared of before. But it sounded like a legit language that I understood a bit. It was so unique that it doesnt have similarities with language that I have heared.

After he was threatning he put his gun down and I spoke back to the language that he was speaking. I couldnt understand what I was speaking as if my mouth was moving on its own. But at the same time it felt like I could understand it? Idk what I was feeling and I couldnt comprehend what I was feeling at the same time. It was such an odd and unique experience. I know that it was a sleep paralysis when I woke myself up by controlling my breathing and closed my eyes. This is the first time I have experienced it and I regretted trying to end it there.",1
No demons? How many?,"I'm fairly new to this sub. It seems like almost every post is about sp demons. My very first episode was I saw my runaway dog sitting on my chest. Not scary, but weird.  20 years later, every other episode was just not being able to move for a bit",1
Multiple consecutive SP episodes on Stomach,"Okay so I thought I’d share this since I haven’t seen many people talk about SP on their stomach. This happened last Summer and I was visiting my parents. I was taking a nap on the living room couch on my stomach, when I “woke up” and was in sleep paralysis. I couldn’t see anything as my face was buried into my pillow but I heard footsteps approaching me and sitting on the desk chair that was placed right next to the couch I was sleeping on. That was my dad’s chair and me and him were the only two people home so I assumed it was him. This lasted a while and Im used to SP but I was pissed because I just wanted to get some rest so I was trying to make some sort of movement or noise for him to wake me up. I eventually got out if it by wiggling my toes and I sat up and no one was on the chair, my dad was asleep in his room. I got freaked but immediately continued my nap.

I ended up having SP again, and this time the exact same thing happened. I once again started trying to get his attention to wake me up since I thought it was actually him this time. This is when I heard the chair move (like someone got up off of it) and heard footsteps approaching me. I then felt this sharp pain in the middle of my spine, almost like a knife or like someone just really digging their fingers into my spine. It really hurt and I eventually woke myself up again. Once again, no one was on that chair or in the room.

lol so I went back to nap because I was exhausted, but this time on my back, and I got SP a third time but I didn’t see anyone (it was daytime and I’ve always wondered if people see shadow figures in the daytime because that was the only SP episode I’ve had in the daytime) Anyways, I told my parents and they are extremely religious and told me all these prayers to do but Im not religious myself. Just the visual of my head buried into my pillow with my quiet shrieks asking for help and being met when this sharp pain in my back terrifies me and humors me at the same time.",1
Lasted 15 seconds,Just experienced it for the first time and it lasted 15 seconds is that normal lol i just kept waggin my finger,1
Extreme pain consecutive nights in a row and ability to move?,"For context I’ve had sleep paralysis on and off my entire life and from a young age and the dreams from when I was younger were primarily either a dark haired demonic lady sitting in the corner of my room and I could move and walk up to her but she wouldn’t move or it would be a dark figure at the end of my bed starring at me who’d eventually strangle me which I could feel but I’d wake up after ‘dying’ in the dream.

But recently 10 or so years later I’ve been having sleep paralysis night after night (in a new house)  after rarely having it for years. The first dream I woke up in my house and believed I was awake and entered the kitchen to get some water and my roommates were there but I felt slightly off about our interaction and began feeling dizzy so I ‘went back to bed’ and as soon as I laid back in my bed and closed my eyes I couldn’t breathe like as in gasping for air couldn’t breathe. I could hear my fathers voice telling me to stay alive as I felt like I was suffocating and slowly losing consciousness I truly believed I was dying in my sleep. I tried to stay awake and breathe but every breathe was so shallow I felt I was going to die soon so I reached my hand out to my dads and could feel it physically and out of nowhere I felt almost a claw puncture my arm after I reached out. The claw removed itself from my forearm and I could feel it reaching for my throat so I bit it and it felt so real as if I crunched into someone’s hand and then I woke up. When I woke up my forearm was in so much pain as if it had been stabbed yet no scratch marks or anything.

The second night I fell asleep and again in the dream ‘woke up’ in my bed thinking I was actually awake so I scrolled through my phone looking at a video I edited for a friend. The video felt unusual to what I remembered and then it slowly became disturbing as the footage was cut with things like ‘warning’ so I freaked out and closed my phone and attempted to ‘get back to sleep’. But I saw a large black almost branch like monster who was just like wires or branches and had claws nothing like anything I’d ever seen before and I felt compelled to ensure I didn’t see it’s face. I had an inkling I might’ve been dreaming so I tried to move my hands and feet a lot to wake up but in the middle of doing so I felt this uncontrollable urge to reach my hand out so I did and the monster punctured the top of my hand with its claw and after minutes of feeling extreme pain and having the monster come closer I woke up and my hand hurt like hell. But yet again no scratches cuts or anything just extreme pain.

I’m so confused at how extreme the pain is both in the dream and when I wake up? Is this sleep paralysis or something else. Does anyone have any idea why I can move in these dreams and feel pain so vividly?",1
Sleep paralysis but from a third person perspective?,"I've had sleep paralysis a few times in my life, usually after waking up at night then going back to sleep. My most recent one involved me in a slightly altered version of my bedroom but observing myself from a third person pov in a motionless state as a frog/spider hybrid slowly makes its way down to my body. 

I would struggle as normal and woke up just before the spider reached my face, most likely from fright.

Would this still be a sleep paralysis episode or just a vivid and very frightening dream?",1
Sleep paralysis (black smiling entity),"Sleep paralysis (or entity )

My uncle was telling me how he sufferers with sleep paralysis( at the time I didn’t think it was really real). A month later I have it about 3-4 times over the space of a month in a half, the most frightening one being when I was facing my wall asleep and could feel someone pulling my shoulder as if for me to turn round in my bed, I thought I was getting pulled by my mum or something so just ignored it and used all my strength to keep facing the wall as I was half asleep, and didn’t want to be disturbed. however whatever pulled me over was able to turn my whole body around slowly but without a struggle and as I realised there was this slender really tall all black figure standing over me and all I could see was it’s white teeth smiling at me, it then turns me over and I went back to sleep( I couldnt move this whole time) I could not even move my mouth to shout(normally I shout for Jesus as I am a Christian and this call always works) really has scared me till this day as I wonder what really happened, I know it’s not a dream as I can tell the difference between the two and like I said I was being physically turned over, anyone had similar experience to this ? As my cousin who is my uncles son said he has seen a very similar thing in the night whilst not being able to move.",1
Happened a few minutes ago,"I haven't had any problems for months now, and then it suddenly happens when I just wanted to close my eyes for a while.. I was tired from reading this one manga, and didn't expect to fall asleep. The worst part for me is the constant ringing in my ears. It was always a woman's high-pitched screaming ringing non-stop, but this is time it was different.. Maybe because it wasn't at night? Even though it hadn't happened for a long time, I was still very adjusted to it. There wasn't any demons, thank god.. I still remember the first time it happened. Just imagine going to sleep and then seeing a creepy girl and some monsters behind her slowly opening your door, not being able to move, and hearing some woman screaming. I had no idea what the hell was going on, but I eventually started making use of it to do whatever I wanted, because I found out I always have a lucid dream after. This time though, I wanted to quickly get up and continue my manga. I wasn't even scared, just annoyed that it took so much effort to wake up. You know how it usually occurs in the place you fall asleep? Yeah, I wasn't really scared because it was really bright outside. I tried to open my eyes, but I didn't even know if I was really opening them. I don't know how to describe it, but it's hard to differentiate if you're actually moving, or if you just think you are but you're actually not. It was annoying, since I knew what was going on. First thing I did when I woke up was open my phone. No hesitation/.",1
Recurring Sleep Paralysis,"I've always had sleeping problems. Even when I was a kid, I would have nightmares every night and frequently experience sleep paralysis, and if I didn't have a nightmare then I wouldn't have a dream at all. Or at least I wouldn't have remembered it even just after I woke up. Eventually, I guess I grew out of it. Sparsely I would have nightmares and eventually more sleep paralysis. Then I moved out of my house and rented it out, then my family moved back in. The house is really old for the area. Like REALLY old, one of the oldest in the town. It has some history to it. It used to be some sort of hotel, then eventually a stable, then a house. The problems I had as a kid started up again when I moved back but that was almost two years ago and I haven't had any problems since. Then my grandma came to visit my family from out of state for about 15 days. My mom decided she would stay in my room and I was sent out to an extra little room not connected to my house that is more of a little storage attachment stuck onto the garage, which is also not connected to my house. This was literally just a room, with a bed in it and some of my cousin's things, (she was living with us at the time and stored some of her stuff in there). This was just at the end of February and start of March 2020. I moved my stuff out there like my PC and my Xbox and the first couple of days were great. More than great, actually, I loved it, even considered asking my mom to let me stay out there. I had my own space, felt like I was on my own, and listened to music as loud as I wanted, stayed up as late as I wanted, and felt more motivated with my school work. Being more isolated helped me focus, and I looked forward to my alone time after school. Soon, this feeling changed. First, I started waking up at 3:05 or 3:10. I would wake up and hear movement around me. Above me, outside the window, near the door, in the garage. The first night when I awoke, I couldn't move, I was stuck on my stomach, facing the window. I heard voices, not super loud, more like louder than whispering but not quite talking, outside the window I was facing. I couldn't see anything, because it was completely dark in the room besides a tiny bit of light from my monitors but, I couldn't see anything but the side of my bed, the floor and a tiny bit of the windows next to me. So it was completely dark. I shut my eyes, trying to force myself out of the experience. (Side note, whenever I have a nightmare, I almost get lucid, but when it becomes too scary, I become lucid, and somehow wake myself up.) This was not working, and it never has during sleep paralysis. I tensed up my eyes and just kept trying. The more I fought, the worse it got, voices were inside now, louder and louder closer and closer, they just kept saying over and over, ""10 months, 10 months, 10 months"". And then silence. A moment later directly in front of my face I felt something move. All I heard, was ""You are going to die in 10 months."" I opened my eyes as the sentence finished, and was met with a flash of bright yellow orange and white lights, and the loudest BOOM sound I have ever heard. It was like a bomb blew up 3 inches from my face. My eyes shut again and the force of the explosion pushed me onto my back, right then, I woke up for real and had control of my body, and I shot upright and pretty much freaked out. I looked at the time, 3:05. I called my girlfriend and told her what happened, and she calmed me down. I just watched Netflix and YouTube for the rest of the night until I had to get up for school that morning. The next day I told my friends at lunch, and they were thoroughly freaked out, but told me about some scary dreams of their own and calmed me down, reassuring me it was just a dream, and nothing to worry about. The next night, I woke up to the same thing as the night before. Voices, outside the window. But this time, something was off. I could sense that something was in the room. Right in the middle of the room. I could here it moving on the carpet. Once again I couldn't move. I couldn't see. I felt the bed move as it climbed on. Two steps closer to me. And then it stopped, and sat right on my back, holding me down. The voices continued outside the window and I felt the weight shift. The fucking weight of the thing sitting on my back moved closer. Right behind my head. I could hear it breathing in my ear. Inhaling. Exhaling, the breath hitting the back of my neck. Then it got up, and left. I had control again, and shot upright. I looked around, and there was nothing there. Checked my phone, 3:05. I thought about calling my girlfriend again, but didn't want to wake her up a 2nd night in a row. I just watched more YouTube and Netflix until it was time for me to leave for school. The next night, I stayed up later, in an attempt to sleep through that damned 3:05 AM to see if it would make a difference. I slept through, but only to 3:10 AM. Fuck. This time, no sleep paralysis. I had control, and I was tired. But I couldn't figure out why I was awake. I shook it off and went back to sleep. Uneventful night. Caught up on the sleep I lost and headed off to school for the day. Then, every night for the next couple of days, I would wake up at 3:10 again, or somewhere close to it. Really anytime between 3:10 and 3:20, but always around then. I would just shrug it off and head back to sleep. Then eventually, I woke up to loud knocking, LOUD. I couldn't tell where it was from, but I just shot up and went to grab my car keys, assuming it was morning and my Dad was knocking at the door to ask me to move my car so he could back his out of the driveway. But after my sleepiness wore off, just as I was putting my first foot onto the floor from the bed, I realized it was dark out. I checked my phone, sometime just before 3:10. I looked around, saw nothing out of place, and tried to go back to bed. This wasn't the first time I've randomly woken up to a knocking sound. So I tried to get back to sleep. Just as I was drifting off, right at the point where you sometimes feel like you are falling off a building and shake awake, I heard the knock again. This time I shot up and looked out the window to the area outside the door. There was nothing, and no one there. I didn't really expect to see someone there. The knocking didn't really come from a certain direction, it was just heard in my ears, maybe even just in my head. Eventually, I got back to sleep. The next night, was one of the worst. I consider this to be my experience in the back rooms. something I didn't really know about until after this happened, while trying to figure out what any of this even means. I woke up, or I thought I did at least. Laying on my back, I opened my eyes to see the ceiling. Then I fell, down, into my bed, I leaned back and back farther and farther and felt a weird rush around my like when you break the surface tension of the water in a pool. It was like I fell through a painting in Super Mario 64. As I passed through the threshold into some sort of office building or something. But I had come out of the wall. The bottom of my bed shared the same face as the wall. I had control of my body, I could move, walk, stick my hand up to the wall. But I felt weird. Almost like I was sleep walking or something. Like when you wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, you don't really know what's going on too much, just more like you are there. I turned around a looked at my surroundings. Narrow hallways, almost like a hotel. No doors, just hallways. Tons and tons of hallways, each splitting off into more and more. The carpet was a weird dirty beige brown color, and the wallpaper similar, but a lighter beige, almost yellow, but not quite. The wallpaper was peeling in some areas, but was white underneath. I walked around. Down one hallway, into another, noticing some open up into a room, these rooms had 2 solid walls, but the other 2 went to more hallways. I just kept going. I was just wondering around for what felt like 45 minutes or so. Then from far, really far, maybe 200 ft down the hallway I was currently on. I could see some sort of black figure, peeking out from behind the wall. I stopped. It never occurred to me that I wasn't the only person, or thing rather, that was in there. I began running. Running down this hall, then that, left, right, left, right. Not thinking about what I was doing. Then I saw an area with a bunch of rooms. This part of whatever place I was in, or dreamed I was in, was dimly lit. I picked a room, and ducked into it. This one had 3 solid walls. Only one hall in, and one hall out. I realized I had no clue where I was and no way to get back to where I was. I was hopelessly lost. Then, I saw it turn the corner. The black figure, shaped like a human, but all black. Dark black with no lines or anything. Similar to those black body suits some people wear for Halloween. But this one wasn't a fabric, it was rubbery almost, like skin but smoother. It was maybe 50 ft away, and it definitely saw me. I was fucked. I had nowhere to go. Unexpectedly the figure took a right and went down another hall. I was confused, was it letting me go? Where was I? What is that thing? My mind was racing and my adrenaline was pumping. I looked around the room, and saw it. Behind me, coming out of the wall, it's hands outstretched, clawing at me, it's upper body through to this side of the wall. I turned tail and fucking ran. I ran and ran, through any random hall. Left and right through the fucked up place I was stuck in. After running for hours. I was exhausted. I was sure I had lost it at this point and began to hit the walls in frustration, in anger, I was screaming. I hit a wall with all my force, and slipped right through it. I felt my body fall into the wall and I was leaning down, almost like I was going to touch my toes, and I was back in my bed leaning upright sitting in my bed. Back home. I was speechless. Tears formed in my eyes. I turned on my phone, and saw it was 3:05 AM. Dammit. I once again watched YouTube and Netflix on my phone until I had to leave for school. At this point, there were only 3 days until my Grandma left. 2 more nights I had to stay in that damned room. I told my friends about it and we ended up finding that backrooms creepy pasta, which was eerily similar to my experience the night before. I've yet to have another dream like that, and I hope I never will again. The next nights were fine, I slept pretty well and would still wake up in odd hours but it wasn't 3 am anymore. It would be like 2am or 5am and I would go right back to sleep. Eventually, I was back in my actual room, in my house. Soon after I had sleep paralysis again. I have a projector screen covering one of my walls completely. I woke up, and heard the voices, saying ""10 months, 10 months, 10 months"" just like the first night, and I could see someone standing behind the projector screen, a undeniable, outline of a person, right behind the screen. Since then, I haven't had any issues and slept pretty well in my room. But recently, I went to spend the night at my girlfriends house. I had sleep paralysis again, and I heard the voices, ""10 months 10 months 10 months"" over and over, not even synced up, just like 20 people saying it starting and stopping at different times. I could feel the weight of that thing on top of me. Then it was over. I turned and saw my girlfriend, back turned to me on the opposite side of the bed. Is this an issue that occurs when I change the place I am sleeping? What is up with the 10 months thing? What the fuck was the dream? Am I going crazy? Should I go see someone like a therapist or something?",1
"Trying to sleep but every 10secs I drift off I feel my body paralysed and I can't breathe, it jolts me up and I force myself to breathe? I'm scared I've only had 2 hours sleep in 2 days because of this. Anyone had similar?","I'm 25 F, obese but not morbidly so. I'm 220lbs and 5ft8, concerned it's possibly sleep apnoea. I've literally had no proper sleep in days partly due to stress etc, and now whenever I'm drifting off I feel the absolute fear and dread as I'm literally paralysed and my heart feels like it's stopped and I'm not breathing.. I struggle for a few seconds in this state and wake gasping, heart beating, then drift off again from pure exhaustion, and the process repeats. It's so hard to describe. It's happened like 10 times in the last half hour, my body freezes like I'm dead and I have to wake up. Jolting myself awake to breathe as I can feel myself trapped, literally stuck in suffocation as I drift off. 😭😭. I neeeeeed sleep. I've forced music on now to keep myself awake as I can't do it, I can't have this feeling when I'm trying to sleep. I'm so so tired.",1
Sleep Paralysis in Its Okay to Not be Okay (Kdrama),"Was watching this Kdrama on Netflix when [this ](https://youtu.be/KpVKFpkudxs) scene portraying sleep paralysis came up. Was actually surprised since this was the first time I’ve seen this portrayed on screen in something that isn’t a horror movie or series. The drama isn’t a horror or supernatural series (as the viewer you actually know that her hallucination isn’t a ghost or vengeful spirit but rather a result of her trauma >!from her abusive mother who is alive!<) so to have this scene that had the viewers feeling empathy for the character and what she suffered from and not supernatural fear about SP was kind of touching. I found her heavy breathing and screaming spot on. SP is no joke. I was actually able to point out to my family who was watching with me that that was exactly how I feel when I have SP. 

Just some clarification on the drama: the title is It’s Okay to Not be Okay. The series focuses on mental disorders with the male lead being a caretaker at a mental hospital and his older brother having autism and the female main character having an antisocial personality disorder. I highly recommend it if you’re looking for something to watch on Netflix. This drama actually opened a lot of discussion about mental disorders in Korea where it’s usually viewed as taboo (it’s pretty taboo in a lot of asian countries actually, source: I’m Filipino) I’ve actually had some friends ask me about sleep paralysis after watching this scene",1
My Sleep Paralysis Demon is an Anime Girl,"One night, when I was sleeping, I awoke to a presence in my room. I wasn't facing the same direction where it was but i was definitely sure something was there. Even though i wasn't looking at it, I can kinda see it vaguely as if i had eyes behind my back that needed prescription glasses.

I tried to focused on the monster in the corner, then I saw it.

It was a fricking anime girl looking at me in the darkness.

Even though there was literally nothing scary about her look, there was still something menacing about her, I just don't know what.

Maybe it's an attempt of my sleep paralysis demon to be cute yet terrifying, or something.

People get scary ghosts or the devil as their sleep paralysis demon that likes to hover and spook them and stuff.

But here I am, getting an anime girl as my demon, just stalking me in the corner.

To be honest, I've noticed that most of my sleep paralysis demons aren't scary, they're more of a budget film ghost antagonist. But this time, I was just confused.

It just feels like my demon gave up and was like ""eh whatever, I suck at being scary anway, so let's be an anime girl this time around!""

Also, since a lot of my nightmares/sleep paralysis turn into either good or lucid dreams,

When I was nearing the end of my dream, I also had a chance to fight and have an epic battle with my sleep paralysis demon.

So yeah, i'll say it was a pretty awesome night.",1
I had a terrifying dream that ended in paralysis,"This is an account of the dream I had last night, which woke me up at about 4:10 in the morning, and my first struggle with sleep paralysis.

The dream began with me returning to my home, although it was a place I’d never been before. The house was beautiful, with Spanish tile covering the floors, large planters along the walls filled with large overgrown rose bushes and mother-in-law’s tongue, but it was dark and empty and something felt misaligned, like there was something sinister there. The bathroom resembled the one from my childhood home in a way, the layout and the size of it, but there were old fashioned rotating fans hung high up on the walls. The wiring had been crossed somehow, and in my dream when I flipped the switch the light fixtures spun in slow circles instead of turning on. I remember sensing someone else in the house so I walked into the adjoining different rooms, an entryway, and a kitchen, both dark and empty.

And suddenly there was a woman there with me, with dark hair in a beetle-bob haircut down to her shoulders and white gown. She looked to be late forties, and she was scared. She began telling me about a dream that she had, and I was seeing the dream though her eyes as she spoke. She said she had been standing in a street market that was filled with people. From across the crowd she could see a man coming towards her, and as he walked past the people and stalls, he was reaching out and touching everything he passed. She knew that he was going to reach her and that he was going to touch her and that it was going to hurt. I envisioned his hands black with dried blood, and he was holding a sharp object, or else his nails were long and sharp. It was hard to tell for all the blood. He moved slowly toward her and she said his name was Euvan. She kept repeating how it was going to hurt when he touched her.

And then I woke up in my bed, lying on my back. But I was unable to move my body. I remember trying to sit up and focusing my attention on my arms, trying to get them to move so it would break the spell but for a while I couldn’t. I remember saying the name “Euvan” out loud. I also remember the sensation of hands running over my body, up and down my legs and chest and arms in waves. And then it stopped and I could move again.

I’ve never heard the name Euvan before, didn’t know it existed before last night.

&#x200B;

Edit: I had this dream about five months ago, well before Covid-19 could have influenced it.  This is the original text that I wrote down at four in the morning that night, but I am just posting it now because it is the first time I've thought of it since Covid, and it somehow strikes me as more meaningful now.  Maybe I'm reaching for straws, maybe I got a premonition of sorts.

Also, I believe in magic.  I do not base my life around it, but I believe enough to not want to give any power to whatever this feeling might be.  So I changed the name of the man in the stalls a little.  

After that night, I couldn't shake the heavy feeling that dream left, and went to a yoga to the people class, which i never do, in order to work it out and relieve the tension, but that day and the day after felt darker and heavier.

I haven't had sleep paralysis since, or anything else as ooky spooky.  Right now, I believe this was a glimpse into the current reality, from the distorted vantage point of a different mindset. But who knows? Has anyone else met Euvan or heard of it?  Other singular experiences that shook you like this?

Recurring Sleep Paralysis: The Man In The Coat,0,1
SP,have you guys ever encountered a man with no face? just eye sockets,1
Anyone have any experiences with death talking to them?,"Long post 

Man in all white throwing things at me
First it was stuffed animals then it became books. Once a chair. He kept talking in a dark voice that sounded like death. Eventually he started to get close. Leaning in and sayin things in. A harsh voice. All I could make out is do you want to die and I am going to kill you. He kept getting closer. Right before it stopped he got up to my face and I could see him. It was an all white suit. Skull for a face. It felt like the grim reaper. The whole time I couldn't move, I thoughr he was going to stab me. I kept trying to scream and move but I couldn't. He kept asking me if I wanted to die. I couldn't talk. I couldn't move. The last thing I saw him have was a knife. 


This was after two nightmares I slightly remember. Well one was a weord dream. All I remember was being at work and weird stuff kept happening and I had random people on my phone background. Eventually I realized something was really of and ""woke up"" into what became more of a nightmare. I was on a group FaceTime call with these 4 random people. They wouldn't tell me their age or name. At first I thought I was actually awake but soon realized something was off again. They kept talking about random shit. Then I realized i was for sure dreaming still when I saw a second window in my room behind my head and a shadow figure walking past it then walking past my other window (I live on the second floor) at this point I knew something bad was coming. I turned around and tried to go back to sleep, which I did. But when I ""woke up"" again is when I saw the reaper sitting on my bean bag chair. At first he looked like the shadaw figure from before. At this point I couldn't move or talk. I was stuck. Thats when he started asking if I wanted to die and throwing the physical objects at me. I swear I coild feel them hitting me. His voice was so harsh and slightly deep. Exactly what I think death would sound like. I actually woke up shaking. Not sure if I was actually awake. Not sure if I was going to meet another demon. Pretty much no sleep the whole night


I'm sorry for the bad wording but I wrote this as soon as I got out of that, I was really tired but I decided to write my experiences down now when I have them to better describe them",1
I’m just a wee bit too terrified to go to sleep,"Let me preface this story by saying, I don’t think I’ve ever experienced SP before last night. Not too sure if it was SP, I have the normal (what would be normal for me) vivid nightmares here and there; however, I’ve never once woken up and not been able to move before last night. I normally fight any bad dreams by sleeping with my portable ac unit set to 64 degrees f and a blanket that isn’t too thick but isn’t too thin. I halfway on my side and on my stomach holding onto a pillow for comfort, and I’m 19 weeks pregnant, so vivid or weird dreams aren’t uncommon for me. I’m extremely intuitive, I have dreams that tend to come true, and I’m in tuned with everything going on around me and I normally have a sense for what is going on. 

Last night was one of the more terrifying nights of my life, I’ve come close to death, experienced it, I’ve seen terrifying and horrible things, but those experiences are nothing compared to the feelings I had last night. I was exhausted, I could definitely fall asleep fast if I had wanted to, but every time I attempted to fall asleep, I’d wake up in utter darkness unable to move. It’s as if my body fell asleep instantly but my brain was wide awake. I’ve heard stories of SP, most of which were people waking up not able to move from the dead of sleep, I’ve never heard of someone falling asleep and instantly experiencing SP. At first if felt like I was laying in bed comfortable, next thing I knew it felt like I was talking to someone but I couldn’t move, in my head my son was right next to me and the tv was one but it was only white noise. I turned off the tv, then I realized afterwards I couldn’t move. I had to force myself to move, I figured by concentrating on the smaller appendages I could force myself to move, which worked. I realized what happened, what I felt, what I saw, was not real. I checked my phone to see not even a few minutes have passed. I figured it was a one time occurrence and I could just try and go back to sleep again. I was extremely wrong. The night followed with 3 more occurrences of thinking I fell asleep, seeing pitch black and then trying to move. All three times, I forced myself to move, small appendages first, then my whole body would jolt and jerk up as if they were already in motion. My last attempt at trying to go to sleep was the most terrifying, it started the same, seeing pitch black but this time I was hard to move, it felt as if something was after me, it’s all pitch black but I know it’s there, it felt like it took forever to try and move. I finally was able to move and decided to just stay awake until I had to go to work. 

I thought that was the end of it and I wanted to take a nap when I returned home from work but I couldn’t, I have a 2 year old to take care of and a house to clean and mommy’s day doesn’t stop just because she had a (pardon my language) shitty night. When it was his time to take a nap, of course it was a perfect opportunity for me to nap as well. I did my normal routine: AC at 64 and a blanket to cover myself. I tried to fall asleep and it’s like I instantly fall into a dream, except I’m completely aware of my body, I felt a grab at my side and woke up, couldn’t move, mentally I couldn’t even fight it so I jump from one dream to another each time waking up not being able to move until finally I’m able to fall asleep, and stay asleep. I woke up in the same position finally able to move, I still feel tired and exhausted but honestly, I’m terrified to sleep. I’ve been anxious about sleeping during times of my life, but this is the worst it’s ever been. If I could just have someone to talk to about this, to talk about anything that would be great. 

I apologize at my lack of story telling skills, or even reddit etiquette, I’ve never really posted before and naturally I’m a 5 year old when it comes to telling stories. I do appreciate anyone who has the time to read this, thank you.",1
Demonic Growl and Astral Projection," I have had sleep paralysis quite a few times once felt as though something was pinning me down on my chest and heard this insane demonic growl.  

A couple of those sleep paralysis experiences I had what I believe to be astral projection instances accompanying them. I know that sounds CRAZY but I was standing up and on the side of my bed looking at myself. Even weirder was I tried to walk away and was able to make it to the foot of the and it was the most intense experience. it was as though I was walking through gelatin it took all my strength to move and was very warm feeling. I was so freaked out and I was pulled back into my body and woke up. The second time it happened I fought through that thickness and made it into the hallway and was too scared to go any further it was as though something was telling me if I went further I wouldnt make it back. I know it sounds crazy but I cannot explain it. 

Shortly after I got divorced and moved from that apartment that my kids and ex wife swore  was haunted. Idk about that because I never experienced anything strange there besides the sleep paralysis. Has anyone else experienced that astral projection and feeling of walking through jello?",1
Similar experiences?,"I get sleep paralysis every single time i sleep face up but any other position im fine, whenever i get them i have the same kind of dream and pain in my body anybody know what the position can affect it?",1

Sleep Paralysis or Real Demonic Attempt?,"A day before my first SP happened, I got this weird bruise mark around my Adam Apple's area, as if've been brutally punched - there was no pain felt tho. The next day, the bruise's gone, so I kinda ignored it and thought maybe I strained my vocal chord too much - i'm an aspiring singer. 

But later at night, 5:00am sharp. I was suddenly awoken, lying back on my bed accompanied by the bedroom light. But i couldn't move an inch, few seconds after that realization, an eerie weird whispering female voice came onto my left ear. 

She was murmuring so fast and I could pick up only certain consonants over it, and I belive she speaks a Buddha Mantra (a spell from the traditional culture for asian countried like Thailand/Myanmar - I'm a Muslim Malaysian tho)

I was in shocked, couldn't move anything. I tried to scream and recite a holy verse to arm myself with, but the whispering went louder. The only body part I could move was my right fist. 

I clenched my fist so hard until I could lift it to stomp my bed sheet. And right after I did that, the whisper dissappeared, but I still was unable to move normally. 

So i closed my eyes and few tears were out. I keep on praying inside. After 10minutes I can finally move my legs and the others one by one. 

So.. i'm posting this onto both SP and Paranormal communities, hoping to find a new information so that I could track the murmurs, I know it means something.

Tones causing terror?,"I felt like I maybe woke up or I was dreaming, I can’t tell what state I was in. But I started to be aware of a tone just within or almost just out of my range of hearing. It piqued my interest. I felt like I had to focus more and more on that tone. But as I mentally zeroed in on the sound, it immediately changed, like it knew I was aware of it and I immediately was overwhelmed with fear. Odd, because a tone or a frequency isn’t scary, like at all. But I was just stuck there, terrified, hearing this tone. Then after a while, I became less scared and then sat up, got my phone and scrolled the reddit scroll to get my mind on something else.",1
Sleep paralysis linked to address?,"     While in my late teens I had to move back in with my mother. She had just recently moved into a house on wises grove rd in new Brighton pa, usa. She tended a horse farm in exchange for living quarters and a stable for her horse. I moved into and empty room in the upstairs that had two closets; one on each side of the room and the length of the room. It was filler area for where the roof of the house sloped. 
     I had no possessions due to moving around so much in my teens. I abandoned everything but my bass guitar and some knives as well as a bag of clothing and work boots. I made a mattress out of old couch cushions and a sheet. The rest of the room was bare beside a broken vacuum cleaner I used as a coat rack. 
     The first night I stayed in the room I got an overwhelming feeling of something not right in the room. Just a general bad feeling. (I am really sensitive to subtle energy changes.) This was a feeling I hadn't felt in quite some time. I played it off as it was my first night in the new place with new noises and new energy to get used to. I slept fine with no interruptions other then getting used to sleeping on cushions. 
     I wish I could say the same for the next night but, I can not. I set up my bed as I usually did, you know the night previous set the standard. As I laid in 'bed' i got that feeling again; this time worse. I felt myself tear up for an unknown reason. I felt terror and dread. I have never felt those before, not like this.
     I woke up at about 1 am. I am frozen solid. I try to speak but can not. I try to move but I can not. There is someone in the room. They are sitting on the edge of the right side of the bed toward my feet. I feel as though if my body could work it would only pee on itself. To make things worse; I was in an actual bed with blankets that were white and the room was decorated with things that were not mine. Dressers and  pictures lined walls. 
     The person on the edge of my bed looked horrid. It was a little boy that was badly burnt. He was trying to get me to help him and after I saw him k wanted to help. But I couldn't move. He got up and walked to the door and dissapeared. I woke up when my alarm went off for work. Confused. 
     The very next night: I wake up at around 1 am. I can not move. I am not scared when I see the boy on my bed. He asked me to follow him he has to show me what happened to him. I sit up in bed but my legs were glued to the mattress. I looked back to see me laying on the floor still asleep on my cushions through the bed. I turn to reach for the boy but he was gone. 
     I moved in with the girl I am still with today. Have never experienced anything like that before nor after this. It was the creepiest and coolest thing I have ever experienced. I know some of you are going to be mad by me saying this but I feel as though if I would have chosen to stay with mom I may have eventually gotten up. If I would have gotten up this thing may have kept me or taught me something. The idea is amusing and I wish I would have stayed to find out what happened to the little boy or what would have happened to me if I tried to help.",1
SP Back after Having Baby,"Hi all I’m new to this subreddit. I dealt with sleep paralysis a lot when I was going through my undergrad. After graduating, it started to get less and less until I didn’t have those types of dreams anymore. 

I had my daughter back in April of this year and the sleep paralysis is back. Has anyone else experienced a gap in sleep paralysis brought back by a major life event? Could it be the sleep deprivation? 

For some context, I also work full time and am getting my MBA online but I don’t feel any more stressed than usual. In fact, I love where I work and don’t stress about it.",1
my boyfriend has sleep paralysis every night,"for years now my boyfriend has been dealing with sleep paralysis every single night. its a very rare occasion when he doesn't have sleep paralysis and for that reason he avoids taking naps throughout the day. he says he's already gotten used to it, but as his partner i worry a lot. sometimes we'll be asleep together and i'll wake up to his breathing getting heavier and faster and his eyes kinda start twitching, like i can see his eyes underneath his eyelids moving side to side rapidly. he's told me that if it happens to just wake him up immediately. and it usually takes a couple of shakes before he actually wakes up from his deep sleep. i'm just curious if you guys have found anything that helps ease your sleep paralysis? or even a solution as a whole? thank you",1
On top of me.,"I had an experience this morning where I felt a figure of me holding onto my chest.

Does anyone here think sleep paralysis is paranormal?,"WARNING: might scare some people :) 

Okay, so last night I had sleep paralysis. I’ve had it before, but this was my first time actually FEELING something. In my dream there was a baby on a table and I picked it up to hold it. I was staring at the cute baby, looked away for a second, and then looked back down and it turned into a scary witch looking baby and he had a huge nose and the scariest smile, like, ever. And then I heard my boyfriend (who was not with me irl or in my dream) whisper in my ear “don’t be scared” or “don’t worry” or “it’s okay” or something to that affect and then I could literally FEEL someone pressed against my hip bones super hard. Then I opened my eyes (I think?) and felt a hand wrap tightly around mine and I looked down at it, but I didn’t look past the hand because I didn’t want to be scared. I eventually woke my self up by blinking repetitively and moving my toes. 

Anyways, I’m kinda religious, but more than that, I used to see the same ghost everyday for like 3 weeks when I was about 5 (I’m 19 now) in the daytime or sometimes nighttime when I was clearly not dreaming. 

Any thoughts/reassurances?",1
A personal theory on what causes sleep paralysis,"I am not a doctor of any kind.

A little background on personal experience. I have had sleep paralysis on and off since I was about eight years old. Like every other normal person it was a terrifying experience.

I have always been curious about psychology and have actively studied it in my spare time. I also have been also been fascinated by dreams. Sorry to get off topic from the start but come on they are like hallucinations without dangerous chemical effects. 

What I do know about what happens to the body when someone falls asleep is. The brain will actually  change its signal pattern and release a small amount of chemicals from one gland or other to induced paralysis in the body. Which a lack of can cause sleep walking and things of that nature. 

So as I said I get sleep paralysis. At first absolutely terrified of the whole experience. My symptoms were the aware of the room around me and a shadow person standing next to my bed just staring at me with glowing eyes. It got worse when more shadow people would come until eventually my room was a blask mass with ten or so sets of glowing eyes. They would just be there looking at me, they didn't touch me or grab me, nothing. So I kind of stopped being afraid of them after a while.

Enough times of this happening I got curious. I tried my hardest to say something to them or touch them but that didn't work but something did happen I would get out of paralysis faster. The fact I was aware of what was happening and trying to stay in sleep paralysis to interact some how would bring me out of it. That's when my theory started to form.

So to finally get to the point. I believe that sleep paralysis is the mind is some how not synced with the body. The mind is awake and aware but the body isn't completely out of a sleep state causing sleep paralysis. So the next time you are aware of it starting kind of lean into it. Instead of doing your best to get out of it try staying in that state as long as you can. If it works and gets you out of paralysis would you mind posting something so I know if my theory worked.",1
Sleep paralysis hallucinations similar to that of taking acid,"Basically as the title says. I opened my eyes durning paralysis and it looked as if I dropped acid.

Anyone experience sleep paralysis several times a day?,"Of late (several weeks) i am experiencing horrifying bouts of sleep paralysis daily. When taking naps, at night right before my sleep and several times during the night. Each episode is horrible and i feel intense pain in my heart and sometimes i have seizures and my whole body shakes. Often times i have to be physically woken out of it. I am contemplating seeing a heart doctor, to see if i have heart problems even though i maintain strong physical exercise. I do have sleep apnea and i experience these episodes even when wearing CPAP. Its depressing and scary. If anyone has experienced this would love to hear, or if this is a heart condition on top of sleep apnea. thanks for your time.",1
Things weren’t right in this... dream...?,"I’m typing this like literally 2 minutes after I finally woke up. But only snippets.

I only remember snippets of the dream because there were some moment when I feel like I’m on bed but couldn’t move at all so I don’t know if I was awake or not. 

First replay: unrecognisable strangers came to the house and tried stealing my photos from photo albums. I told that one dude but he was agitated but focused on achieving his goal of taking something. He’d even jammed the lock in the box so I couldn’t lock the jewellery case. I remembered trying to run out the house (my deceased grandmother’s house - she passed away in real life last month - I live in her house in real life paying the rents because she wanted me to stay there until I can stand on my two feet) and tried running for help but didn’t know where to get help. I called my grandad via mobile phone and he picked it up but it got muffled and I thought I saw a security guards building complex but strangely I ended up back in the same room. Empty. 

Second replay: I remember that room didn’t feel like my grandmothers house because of the arrangement of the room like windows and door. For some reason I looked outside and told the people who were there not to bring that woman into my room. The woman looked at me damn straight and came in and just started acting suspicious and a bit nasty.

Third replay: some strange dude that looked like some office guy took me to a very ominous apartment complex (I live inside a house in real life) the area was strange and I turned around told him I needed to leave. But he grimaced and pulled down his face and stared at me.

I thought I woke up but couldn’t open my eyes. I didn’t opened my eyes because of what was happening. I couldn’t lift my body and I swear that strange woman was moving me around in my blanket. I kept my eyes closed knowing that I was still asleep. This happened three times in a row. Strange and bizarre motions of my head in blanket becoming stretched up and pulled down on my pillow slowly again and my blanket moving on it’s own so I knew I wasn’t awake but I was in my bedroom. Couldn’t move my arms and it like limp and useless too like wake up bitch lol in my head.So fucking creepy because in real life I this three bedroom house by myself. So I had no where to run and hide or call for help. 

Weird ominous music in the background. Sounded like Timore’s revenge theme.

The moment I woke I heard a car speeding outside. I knew that I was finally awake. But my eyes were trying to drift me back to hell lol. But yes. It was fucking terrifying. She looked like the grudge girl or that long black-haired girl from the evil within.",1
"Is it just me, or do any of you experience physical pain during SP?","It's been awhile since I've had an episode ( I've developed strategies to prevent it ), but most of the time I'm in SP, I get jabbed somewhere random on the body and it hurts a lot. For example, my ribs, scapula, armpit, knuckles, or anywhere that feels vulnerable. twice my nuts, Once even in my bum. It's like someone took a metal rod and strongly pushes it into me. Then when I wake up, most of the time the pain is gone, but sometimes the pain still lingers and the spot feels sore. Okay, some of that sounded wrong, but I'm not joking.

Anyone else have a similar experience? And yes, I still get all the crazy sounds and visuals, though I get way less of that nowadays due to some strategies I use against it. It's just the pain that is very annoying.

I can't reach my back with my hand, especially while laying on my bed, so I'm 100% positive it's not my own fingers poking myself in random spots.",1
Me and my brother had the same thing appear in our sleep paralysis experiences,"A couple years ago when me and my brother were still both young teens we slept in a bunk bed across the room from our closet and door. My brother experienced SP first when he woke up to lying on the bottom half. According to him a large black figure wearing black coat like robes came from the nook in between the bed and the wall adjacent to him and bent down to do who knows what. About a year later I would say I woke up in the same matter. This time I heard footsteps and couldn’t call out to my parents. Through the shadows cast by the remaining light of the night I saw a very tall figure, around 7 ft, with a large black coat and top hat bend under the top of the entrance to our room and walk towards the bed. I’ve experienced some other SP scenarios but what’s creepiest about this one is how me and my brother both had similar figures approach us in SP. I woke up in a cold sweat but was able to forget about it eventually with the constant things happening in my life. Is this just a mental image/dream produced by my brother telling me about his SP or is it just a coincidence?",1
Tell me about your scariest or bazaar experiences.,0,1
I thought I finally got the breakthrough but..,"I'll try keep it at short as possible.

So I've been experiencing SP practically my whole life. I even remember my first ever SP and it was when I was 6. And I can't get normal untill someone wakes me up or else I'm stuck in the loop. I tried to study myself like what could be the reason of having my SP.

Could it be because of something I watch before sleeping, or something I eat, is it because I'm in stress, is it because I'm tired, is it because I'm sleeping alone? And I came to the conclusion that none of it had anything to do with my SP because my pattern was totally random. Sometimes I won't experience it for months, sometimes I'd do it four nights a week. No pattern.

I have read that on multiple places that all you have to do is ease yourself snd you'll be okay, but honestly it isn't as simple as it sounds. Then it became something I learnt to live with, years passed. When all of a sudden, one night something strange happened. I started having a sleep paralysis but automatically (and I actually felt) that my body eased itself and I suddenly woke up without any difficulties.

I thought god damn it! That is it. I finally cracked it. I can do it on my own now.

However I've had SP after that countless times but I was unable to get out of it on my own.

Any of you have any advice for me? Thank you in advance.",1
Generic 'is this SP?' post - also Q about lucid dreaming..,"Lucid dreaming Q - I've had countless dreams (always nightmares) where I'm aware I'm asleep and that I need to wake up to save myself from whatever is hunting me in my dream. Sometimes I see myself through my own eyes and talk to myself in both first and second person. Other times I see myself in 3rd person(?) and I'm trying to alert me as the floating presence to wake up (like I am a camera and the other me is in the room trying to alert me the camera to wake us up), also talking to myself in 1st and 2nd person. Would this be considered lucid dreaming?. Or is it just a normal nightmare?. 

SP Q - Last night I had a strange experience that's kind of creeped me out. In the middle of the night I 'woke up' but was still asleep?. I can't describe it, but it was like I was halfway between conscious and sleep. I was on my stomach and my eyes were closed. I came to and remember thinking I was stuck and needed to wake my partner up to help me but couldn't move. My hand was on his leg and I was trying to squeeze his leg so he could help me wake up but it barely made my fingers twitch. I also tried to make noise but my mouth wouldn't open so made a couple of moans and remember feeling  exhausted by it so fell back to sleep. I didn't feel in any danger or feel like someone was here (that I can remember). Just that I was trapped in place and needed to wake my partner but couldn't.",1
Have you ever been able to hurt your sleep paralysis shadow?,I had an episode of sleep paralysis where  I suddenly had something pointy in my grip (I had no idea how it got into my hand but magically was there after a few seconds) and was able to turn over and hit the sleep paralysis shadow (it was laying next to me).

Sleep paralysis is back 10 years later now that I have depression and anxiety,"Hi all, I’m glad I found this sub.

I first experienced sleep paralysis when I was 17. It was sort of a “classic” episode, I could hear rushing sounds and what sounded like a series of guitar strings snapping. I felt a very real sense of absolute foreboding and fear, then when I tried to scream I realised that I couldn’t move or make a sound. Before I found out it was sleep paralysis I honestly thought that there had been a nuclear explosion because of all the loud, chaotic noises and the fact that I could see everything in my room yet I couldn’t move. I thought that there was a chemical attack or something. 

I described the episode to my Dad and he said it sounded like sleep paralysis and that he had also experienced it, starting at the same age. 

From then on I had episodes where I felt a sinister presence, weight pushing me down, all that stuff. It happened a lot at uni, especially if I was sleep deprived or had fallen asleep during the day. 

After uni it gradually wore off. At one point I even had a cat (RIP) who could sense when it was happening. She’d tap me or sit on me, just touch me in some way and I’d be brought out of it.

I haven’t had any attacks for about 10 years but since I’ve been signed off with depression and anxiety I’m getting it a lot. Usually just as I’m falling asleep (when I sleep that is, I’m really struggling with that at the moment). 

Afterwards or even sometimes before I have this weird almost floaty feeling, but it’s not a good floaty like you’re relaxing on a cloud. It’s hard to explain.

Aside from getting a hold on my anxiety and depression, which I’m trying to do, is there anything that I can do to minimise this occurring? I’m having so many problems with sleep and the sleep that I do get is often disturbed by SP and sometimes I can’t shake that sinister feeling that comes with it, even after I’m awake again.

So glad there’s a sub for this topic!",1
I (23M) have had two sleep paralysis dreams in the past month and a half. I really need some advice please,"
These dreams I’m not sure if they are full on sleep paralysis. From what I’ve researched though they are very close to what sleep paralysis feels like. The first one was me laying in bed and I nudged my fiancé awake and asked if she seen what was at the end of the bed and she sat up and was enveloped by this entity. This entity started leaving the room while looking me dead in the eyes. I couldn’t move or say anything. This thing was slowly closing the door and at the last second of the door almost closed I shot up and opened it then I woke up. The second one was a lot scarier which just happened two days ago. I was laying in bed again and couldn’t move and this different black entity was at the end of the bed looking right into my eyes. It’s hands start reaching for my face slowly, and I can’t close my eyes. Right when it’s hands are about to touch me I wake up. The feeling I can best describe. It is like when you are going up stairs, and the bottom of the stairs are dark and you feel like something is about to get you so you get up stairs kinda quick. It’s that feeling amplified a lot. I just wanted to know anyones opinion because I haven’t been able to talk to anyone that has had these kind of dreams. Feel free to ask any questions.",1
Is this sleep paralysis?,"I’ve never had anything like this ever. I woke up this morning to my dog barking so I let her outside and went back to sleep. As soon as I was just about to fall asleep, I’m already in a dream where I’m at the grocery store and I’m trying to grab my phone from my pocket, but I can’t move my arm at all. Then I suddenly wake up and still can’t move and I feel like I’m actually about to die because Im so disoriented.",1
Encountering SP in the later morning and afternoon when there's more light in the room seems to limit the tricks your brain can conjure. Can anyone else confirm or deny this?,"I have a hypothesis about darkness and shadows and how they're used to manifest certain shapes and figures so commonly reported of in SP.

As a night owl, I usually sleep from 2 am to 10 am, and I only ever experience hypopompic SP, meaning the kind you encounter while waking up. Of the five times I've encountered SP in my life, only once did I see a shadow figure, and it was, true to form, in the dead of night. In all other occurrences since then it's been 50% light in my room at minimum, and I've either not seen anything at all (only felt things), or the hallucinations I do see are fully identifiable things, like a hand or something, not a shadow figure.

Has anyone here seen a shadow figure during an SP episode that wasn't at night? I think it's safe to assume our brains can conjure shadow figures easier in the dark, which is why they're so common, but I'm curious if anyone's brain is beast enough to actually conjure one in a well-lit room.

How I Fixed My Sleep Paralysis,"Hi guys, I just happened to stumble across this subreddit. I thought I would share my experience on the off-chance it could be beneficial for anyone here.

I struggled with sleep paralysis my whole life and only recently in the past four years has it been manageable. 

I learned that instead of panicking and fighting the paralysis, I could recognize what was happening, and let myself fall ""back"" asleep. Eventually I learned to lucid dream in these moments, and it has rarely been an issue since. This definitely wasn't a quick process, and I know the entire idea of calming down in the middle of sleep paralysis seems impossible. But if anyone else has tried this, let me know how it works for you.",1

another last night,"I’ve had really bad sleep paralysis for about 2-3 years. I haven’t had it in quite a while though due to either sleeping next to my boyfriend or on the phone while I sleep. I’m not sure why it helps but it does. Last night I had it again, each time I would fall into it as I closed my eyes. You can always feel when it’s about to set it. I felt it and I kept being told “kill yourself”. I opened my eyes but couldn’t move or even squirm. I tried really hard and got a peep out. My boyfriend heard over the phone and quickly said my name, he never had to experience this with me before but he knows I’ve had it really bad. It was about 4 am. I tried again to go to sleep. I dreamt I was driving, until I was told to drive off the bridge and die.. killing the others in my car in the dream. I woke again and the same thing happened. Continuously I tried to sleep and the third time it told me “kill them all.” “Kill yourself” “die”

Sleep paralysis 4 times in one day.,"I took a nap earlier.  As i fell asleep, me and my girlfriend were at a lake.  She nose dived into the water which appeared to be shallow, and she didn't come up to surface.  I decided to dive in after her but instead of going into the water, I shot up into the sky.  Looking down, I could see the landscape from a higher and higher vantage point.  I said, ""Alright, I guess it's time for lucid dreaming,"" as i placed my arms to the side, and crossed my eyes into the third eye tunnel.  

A demon began forming like the time-lapse of a painting, and moving like a cartoon.  It began speaking very dark sayings I don't quite remember in a weird voice.  I tried to wake up but couldn't so I started creating sounds so maybe my girlfriend laying next to me would hear so she could help me.  I finally fought my way out.

I went back to sleep 5 minutes later, and a new dream began to form.  Again I was fully aware I was dreaming.  There was a very nice black lady singing a really catchy song I've never heard before.  I remember part of the lyrics where she sang: ""If only you knew how I felt, you would understand.""  It was a very cool show, but the singer and the stage slowly began morphing into one single thing I can't quite explain, and the voice became muffled and unpleasant,  so i tried waking up again, to which I couldn't for about 1-2 minutes.  It always feels like my brain in straining during sleep paralysis. 

About an hour ago, I decided to go to sleep, and fell asleep quickly.  I kept partially escaping my body, like waking up, but dreaming in the same room.  Once I made it to the edge of the bed, but got sucked back into body, then I made it to the door, and got sucked back into body.  I remember looking around and seeing myself in 5-10 forms all around the room.  I became scared and tried to wake up, and again; sleep paralysis.

After about 10 minutes of staying awake, I fell back asleep, but again, was dreaming of the room, except everything was misplaced.   Things were floating all around the room, like books and pictures amongst other things I don't remember.  I felt very frustrated and tried to wake up again but couldn't.  I then began singing the lyrics of the song from the dream earlier: ""If you only knew how I felt, you would understand,"" and remember screaming the word, ""understand,"" hoping my girlfriend would help in waking me back into reality.

I am now awake writing this, hoping that I can just sleep normally.",1

Hello and good morning. Who else has experienced “The Old Hag”?,"I’m new to Reddit so this topic has probably been discussed before. Anyways, I was lying in bed with my partner trying to fall asleep, when all of a sudden I could feel the presence of a women at the bottom of my stairs. I brushed it off and ignored the feeling... then my partner gets up to go to the bathroom and as soon as he closes the door the old hag is on top of me that fast. It felt like she was trying to possess me, I could just remember trying to resist letting it happen. My fist where balled tight, I was shaking and my eyes were closed very tightly. And just like that she was gone. It took me a min to tell anyone because I was thinking well, maybe I had a seizure... never had one before but it’s possible, I did have a migraine at the time. Then why the strong feeling of this old lady at my stairs then on top of me.. I told a coworker and she stated that it could be a lady that my partner was cheating on me with, (don’t know if he was cheating at that time) and I just somehow felt her presence. 

I don’t know but has anyone else experienced this?",1
How do you know you’re about to get sleep paralysis?,"Has anyone else got ‘warning signs’ that they’re about to get it? 


I usually experience sleep paralysis when I’m falling asleep and it’s directly linked to over sleeping. Naps are a nightmare, even though I love them. I’ve just come off a night shift and so I’m very tired but I’ve slept all day so I’m struggling to sleep without paralysis happening now.  


When I know it’s about to happen, I get a ringing in my ears and I feel almost dizzy? If I’m really tired I’ll just kinda ‘lean into it” and let it happen but when I’m a bit more alert I’ll fight it and sit up for a while. 


I’ve just tried to go to sleep and it’s happened almost 4 times. It’s such a pain because I’m exhausted. Sleep paralysis has become more of a nuisance than something I truly fear now, since I’ve been experiencing it fairly regularly for 10 years. But I still try to avoid it.",1
Unusual (for me) sleep paralysis twice this morning. Anyone else experience this?,"I’ve experienced sleep paralysis twice before this morning. The first time it happened I was able to actually put myself back to sleep and then began lucid dreaming. The second time was terrifying, but I was able to make it go away because what was happening was so ridiculous I knew it wasn’t real (I was sleeping in a hammock while camping with a group and I was hallucinating a strange man screaming at me. I knew that if he was real, the group would have heard him and someone would have come to help, and that made him go away. I felt very lucky that that worked).

This morning, as I was in that sort of waking up, sort of still sleeping state, something happened twice that hasn’t happened to me before. Both times, my brain was awake, but I was not able to open my eyes, and I was completely paralyzed. In previous two sleep paralysis experiences I had been able to open my eyes but couldn’t move the rest of my body.

So this morning I’m paralyzed, with my eyes closed, but my brain is fully awake. The first occasion, I was able to sort of figure out what was going on and just tried to relax - telling myself that my body just needs some time to catch up with my brain. Nothing too scary. And that worked, I was able to move eventually. I actually fell back asleep but later woke up with the exact same thing happening - completely paralyzed, unable to open my eyes, but fully awake and able to comprehend what was going on. Again I just gave my body time to catch up with my mind and thought about happy things. I’m not sure how long it was in between my mind waking up and my body being able to move. It was very unnerving, although I didn’t feel like I had any issues breathing - maybe because I sleep on my side.

Has anyone else experienced this?",1
I'm scared of having a sleep paralysis tonight. What do I do?,"It's a disturbing feeling that i cant get out of my head, i've had a pretty bad day full of stress and ive watched some horror shit today. I'm scared of going to bed.

**What do I do now?**",1
is this sleep paralysis?,"hi, I don’t know if this is sleep paralysis or just a really weird form of dreaming, basically I’ll be having a dream or sleeping and then I’ll realise that that is happening and I’ll try to wake up. This almost never works and it feels like I’m stuck between being awake and the dream and I can’t fully wake up, I’ll just have to wait until it’s over which is usually quite a long time. In the case of a dream the events of the dream will still be playing out but things will gradually get more distorted and my vision will go black in places until it’s eventually just the sound. I’ve tried forcefully waking up from these but it never works and is actually physically painful at times. I don’t see the typical figure in the corner of my room.",1
Heard a storm outside when there wasn't one. Weird episode,"I usually have sleep paralysis everyday. I ALWAYS close my eyes. I've blinked a couple of times, saw a fuigre. But lord if I saw some weird enity looking at me, I'd DIE. Usually I feel something choking me or pushing me down sometimes stroking my hair or pulling it. Today I heard a LOUD storm and Rihannas 'bitch better have my money' playing in the background. Mind you I didn't have any music on. I felt a gentle stroke on my leg, a female voice whispering something. I hear her alot, I feel like she's telling me off but then again I feel like she isn't a threat and she never pushes me harshly she's quite gentle. Then we have the two thingies which seem to work together. I feel this small but powerful creature choke my ass and hold me down then I feel something tall pull my hair. Like bitch why?... Swear these demons are into bdsm cause man I'm not into this shite.",1
My dreams get corrupted by SP,"Hi there.

Sleep paralysis was something of a myth for me until a couple of months ago, when I discussed it with a younger cousin of mine, who experiences it frequently. Starting from that night, I began having episodes of my own.

However, my episodes are a bit different. I would dream normally but, at some point, one of the characters present in my dream would suddenly do something creepy. For example, last night I dreamt of being at my old house, chilling with two of my friends. One of them went outside for some reason, and me and my best friend went to see what's going on. My other friend was close to the door, and when I called him to get in, he did. Here's when the ""corruption"" kicks in. My best friend says, all of a sudden on our way back to the couch, ""alright, now I'm going to kill you"", and gets this inhumane, devil-like smile on her face from one ear to the other, and my vision goes dark.

Now, I've experienced events like this for a couple of months now and I started getting tired of them so, recently if  this happens in one of my dreams I get aggressive towards this ""corruption"" and often try to attack it. That seems to stop the SP from being installed, waking me up with an anxiety feeling and some paranoia.

This was not always the case though. Back then when I had my first few episodes of ""dream corruption"" I would wake up with SP; but I didn't have any ""SP demon"". Instead, I saw my own family acting weird around me; my little brother sneaking up by the side of my bed with a creepy smile on his face, my girlfriend attacking me from behind when I ""stay up""  after what I think is the end of the SP, even my own parents staring intensely at me somewhere in the corner of my view. At times, I would even have three or four waves of SP one after another, believing it's finally over only to be caught again in one of those creepy scenes. It got to the point where I was afraid of  going to sleep because those experiences drained my energy and gave me serious panic attacks whenever someone acted even slightly weird irl. I do reality checks very often and try to get as tired as possible in order to have a peaceful night of sleep.

Has anyone else experienced stuff like this? How did you get past them?",1
Sleep paralysis or lucid dreaming? Pls I need answers,"Hi everyone, so let me tell you guys weird experiences I have had while sleeping. I’m not sure if it’s sleep paralysis or lucid dreaming because I don’t know how to distinguish them. My first encounter was super scary. I was about 17 when I woke up to my room looking very foggy and cold. There was like a really bright flash coming from my window (I have big windows and sleep across from it) As I tried getting up I noticed I was only able to move my head and chest around as if I was trying to wake up but I noticed my arms were pinned down and I couldn’t move them. As I was looking around my room I can see 6 feet away from me a black tall figure was standing in front of me it had like a veil like the ones nuns wear. I didn’t say anything I was just staring at it for a couple of seconds when I reacted and started shouting leave and fighting out of my own body but I couldn’t move. just my head and chest trying to get up but I couldn’t move my arms felt the force of them being pinned down. The next thing you know I wake up to the same position I saw when I was sleeping I quickly get up and look around my room and everything looked fine. I have had many of those same dreams but that one has by far been the scariest one. I sometimes can’t feel my body but I see things around myself, I sometimes hear sounds like ringing and other times i can see myself sleeping from a distance but quickly wake up. I’m no longer scared of when this happens anymore. I was at first but I just now had something really weird happen again. I was sleeping but I can hear music from far away getting closing when I feel weight on my right side of the bed like as if it’s laying really close to me I try talking to it but nothing comes out of my mouth and I can’t move. This is not as scary but still kind of makes me uncomfortable of going back to sleep as soon as I wake up. 
Can someone explain to me if this is sleep paralysis or lucid dreaming? It feels really real when these episodes happen.",1
My SP experience,"Growing up I would have SP a lot (in some cases for days straight), but am now 21 years old and has been maybe five years since my last experience. This mornings one really freaked me out since it had been awhile.
I was ‘waking up’ and felt the bed rustling, which didn’t worry me because I thought my boyfriend was saying bye because he was getting ready for work at the time. My hair was moved and then I was kissed on the head, however when I opened my eyes no one was there. I was super confused and then realized I couldn’t move. I heard my boyfriend still in the bathroom which really made me freak out. The pressure on my body started to increase and I kept seeing the bed dip in certain spots. The room looked exactly the same from what I noticed and then a shadow thing darted towards me from the corner making the pressure on me even more - I’ve had SP before, but man this one was so vivid. I kept trying to call my boyfriend or move, I even tried to grab my phone which was next to me to actually call him. Eventually the pressure was so much, I just stopped fighting because it was no use. Then I actually woke up and ran to my boyfriend freaked out.
Guess I’ll go back to avoid sleeping on my back lol.",1
Children Laughing in the Backyard,"So I  had experienced sleep paralysis for the first time in my life last night. It was triggered by sleeping on my back, and at first, I felt like I couldn't breathe. Like I was sleep fainting if you will. I knew my brain was oxygen deprived and it literally felt like I was dying and falling into a void. I've fainted twice in my waking life, and this was the same feeling; except I felt like I wasn't in control because I wasn't fully conscious. It all went black for a split second- and I awoke to my jaw tense and locked in place. I then realize I was immobilized, I tried calling out ""help"" to my boyfriend but to no avail. I've read about SP years ago and thought that I could go through life without ever having to experience this phenomenon- so I tried my best to avoid lurking shadow figures that would've haunted me forever by keeping my eyes shut. 

I was so grateful my boyfriend was sleeping next to me so nothing could crawl into bed with me. However; our bed is cornered and I was on that window sill corner that faces our backyard, which extends onto a lake. We hear actual human voices regularly by the lake, but this time I had heard children laughing and running around in our backyard. There was no speech or words, just laughter. This went on for my whole SP experience, and I realized that it must be audio hallucinations since I refused to open my eyes and there was no way children were in our backyard running amuck at 2AM! 

I tried moving my fingers and toes and managed to get my right hand moving. I shook my boyfriend for about 7-10 minutes to try to wake him up. Eventually, ""BABE HELP ME"" came out LOUD and in my normal voice and I could move again. I had escaped from this nightmare of purgatory and was greeted back to the land of the living with ""Go back to sleep, I've got work at 5am.""",1
Brute forcing myself out of SP,"Wondering if anyone else does this or similar. So if I ever “wake up” in SP. Being unable to move, any small attempt at waking up doesn’t work for me. So what I do is a try as hard as possible to throw myself out of bed. If it doesn’t work I relax and try again a few seconds later. I don’t do this completely consciously as it’s partly a wild attempt to not have to see my SPD( which I may or may not see if I stay in SP too long.

tldr: if you have SP, see if brute forcing your way out works.",1
Sleep paralysis that turned into astral projecting?,"So this literally JUST happened and I’m a bit freaked out by it. So I was falling back to sleep after waking up too early and I feel this pressure/deep vibration on my head which I know from past experience leads to sleep paralysis for me. After feeling the pressure on my head I then see myself dancing around my apartment. After watching for a short while I find myself back in bed in the position I fell asleep in. I then try to wake myself up by wiggling my toes & it starts working... 

BUT

I realize that I was waking myself up in the dream! I almost step out of my bed but I get scared and return to the sleeping position. Then all I see is black and a bunch of interesting looking faces just looking at me. They’re all floating around just looking... & then I began to hear a woman singing so I told myself to wake up & wiggled my toes really hard & I finally woke up. 

I have had sleep paralysis before where I see shadow figures or hear voices but I’ve never “woken up” in the dream if that makes sense.",1
SP without Demon,I have experienced alot of SP but there is never a demon there is this normal?,1
The scariest experience I had in sleep paralysis,"I woke up to the feeling of someone touching my back, I looked around the room I saw a shadow standing near my bed, I began to panic and tried to scream for help but my voice didn’t came out! 

After struggling a bit to try to move I finaly was able to do it, but it felt like I was actualy leaving my body, not knowing what to do I tryed to switch the lights in the room but they wouldn’t turn on! 

By doing this I noticed that I was still dreaming (once read that this is a way to know if your dreaming in lucid dreams). During this the shadowy figure was just standing there watching me all the time, sometimes moving. 

Then I tryed to look back at my body laying on the bed but somehow I couldn’t, somethnig was like holding my head not letting me look at it. I eventualy woke up.

I had other similar episodes but this was one of the scariest.",1
Just experienced SP for the first time and I’m scared it’s going to continue to happen,"Sorry if my writing is a little off because I’m still coming down from the adrenaline.

It wasn’t as bad as the other stuff I’ve read on here but at the time I didn’t think it was SP and I thought I was dying.

This happened when I was falling
 Asleep, I didn’t really feel tired and was just laying there with my eye closed. After a short time I began to have incoherent thoughts running through my head and everything seemed to start flashing white really fast with my eyes stiles closed. I also began to feel a vibration through out my whole body, at this point I knew something was wrong and I tried to move but couldn’t. I tried to scream for help but no words would escape from my mouth. As a last resort all tried with all my strength to move and ended up only kicking out with my leg, but this is what ended the experience and I sat up confused on what happen. 

I then looked up “unable to move and talk
In bed.”

It came up with SP and now I’m here.

I’m just confused on why this happened, Ive had regular sleep and nothing out of the usual had changed. 

Will this happen again? Is there a way I can prevent it from happening again?",1
Anyone have any luck with treating sleep paralysis?,"Hey everybody. 

I (25F) started experiencing sleep paralysis when I was 18. Hallucinations/dreams throughout were pretty rare, with the exception of a few instances where I hallucinated/dreamt that I’d gotten out of bed and started my day, only to find out an hour later that I was still in bed. 

Since the beginning of March, the frequency in which I experience sleep paralysis has gone from once every few months or a year to every single night and morning. Every single time I sleep, there is sleep paralysis. Just now, I woke from a bout of sleep paralysis during a nap, and am too agitated to go back to sleep. 

I’ve talked to my therapist about this, and am getting a referral to a psychologist tomorrow so that I can hopefully start some medication to help me out. I’ve read that SSRIs are prescribed to help treat sleep paralysis, which is fine by me, since I’ve been on SSRIs in the past and have been trying to get a new prescription for years to manage my anxiety. We’ll see how this goes. 

This subreddit is full of people’s accounts of their own sleep paralysis, but I’m wondering if there’s anyone still in here who have been successful in stopping/managing their sleep paralysis?",1
Has this happened to anyone else.,"So i have sleep paralysis every now and then. My girlfriend is aware of it and THANK GOD she is beside me when they occur and she knows if i start moaning and whisper ""help me"" she quickly shakes me and gets me awake enough to reposition myself (usually im laying face up on my back when they occur) and fall back asleep.

Here's my question if anyone else has experienced this

So unfortunately i was alone and i woke but was completely paralyzed from moving or waking myself. Then by my bedroom door i saw a dark shadow walk towards me. As soon as it was right beside me the shadow reached out and i could feel it (whatever it was) touching my leg and moving up towards my waist. Completely freaking me out that i could see this image and feel it touching me. I looked down and saw the sheets begin to move as i kept feeling its touch. It went on for what seemed like an eternity until someone in the house turned on a light and it woke me. I didn't move and could see the sheets were in fact moved off my leg and left side of my body and to this day continues to freak out my thoughts when thinking of the whole ordeal.

Has anyone else experienced this? Anyone want to comment on what this was, why it happened? Why me??!",1
Felt so real,"My first time I had sleep paralysis a couple years ago wasn’t so bad, I had this dream we’re I was trying to open my eyes and I had the hardest time doing so and it felt so real and then I woke up. A couple months later it happened to me again but this I went to go take my dogs out to pee and opened up the sliding doors and then I froze and couldn’t move for several minutes. My wife said I was making noises in my sleep and she then woke up me and I was breathing pretty hard. It freaked me out really bad and I couldn’t see what was around me. After I had those two episodes I haven’t really had anything like that since then.",1
"Intense sleep paralysis and nightmares, sudden onset","Hi guys!

So I very recently just started experiencing hallucinations or whatever they are called during my sleep paralysis episodes. I’m not new to sleep paralysis, but recently I’ve been seeing huge spiders crawling on my walls, and some tall, thin shadow figure hanging out in the corner of my room before he walks up to me and puts his hand over my mouth. 

I live alone, but have recently moved home due to being furloughed and wanting to be with family during the pandemic. I currently take 5mg of melatonin before bed, which I’ve been doing for about a year (these hallucinations started about a month ago, before I moved home but after I was furloughed). They are also accompanied with extremely graphic nightmares that are too lengthy to explain here, but could explain in a response to this post if necessary. 

Has anybody else experienced this increase of intensity with their sleep paralysis? And if so, what did you do to help stop them? It’s really messing with my sleep schedule. 

Thank you in advance for any help/insight!!",1
Is it common to have SP 2 times within the same night??,"I’ve only ever experienced SP once in my life, and it happened 2 times in the span of 20 minutes. I’m only assuming it happened because i had gone to bed at 5 AM and had to be up in half an hour so when i woke up i was still in that half conscious state. It was pretty terrible, because i had literally seen the aforementioned “sleep paralysis demon”, the same one both times. I was just curious if anyone else has had this happen to them.",1
my sleep paralysis,"Majority of the time i just see my room or black but occasionally i hallucinate. A few months ago my sleep paralysis was at its worst. it occurred almost every night. The weirdest one was i thought i woke up to someone opening my door and i thought my dad and i had a full conversation. when i woke up i went downstairs and mentioned it and he told me he hadn’t even gone upstairs to the bedrooms. 

the scariest one was after rearranging my room so my bed faced the door, i was asleep on my back, my door was cracked and i saw two pairs of eyes through the crack starring. i watched then they eyes opened the door and it was two people in full fur suits holding knives. the one in the front cocked it’s head and began to walk towards me and i woke up in a scream

last scary one i was swimming in an ocean, struggling until i saw a rock, i made my way to it and as i reached for it the water rose up and only my nose and mouth were above the water, then the sleep paralysis hit and i began to panic and eventually woke up. 

I’ve learned to live with my sleep paralysis but i am curious if anybody else had had similar experiences",1
Sleep paralysis or paranormal?,"The girl by the door:
This experience may possibly have been sleep paralysis. I’m not certain why but I was sleeping next to my mum this evening on the left hand side. I guess I always felt uneasy in the rental. Anyway, on this evening, I was fast asleep and had an unusual dream. In my dream the bedroom door was open and standing in the dark of the hallway was a girl with dark shoulder length hair and a white dress. The girl met my gaze and stared at me with an expressionless face. She took a step towards the bedroom door and as she took a step, ended back where she started. Imagine a scene replaying of a person walking towards you but for that scene to start over but each replay the person gets closer. I was paralysed with fear and could only watch as each time she took a step, she’d end up back where she started. With each step, she got closer to the bedroom. This continued until she was in the room and then her movement changed. She started to move towards me, and she appeared to be darting back and forward, frantically inching closer to me. Her expression changed with her eyes wide as she stood beside me. She glared at me and abruptly grabbed me. I woke up. It was a dream. I looked over the bedroom door in relief. It was closed. But not too soon after, the door opens and the girl is there again, there in the hallway. She immediately starts darting back and forward and lunges at me. I wake up. Look at the door, this time she’s in the room already, darts straight towards me and lunges at me again. Wake up and straight away she darts and lunges at me. This happens about 6 times, each time more closer, more frantically and more aggressively. The last time I wake up for real, in the sat up position as if I was grabbed and woke up during the attack. My breathing was heavy, my mum who woke up said I was having a nightmare.",1
Was this SP?,"I have a memory from my childhood when I was probably about 4-5 years of age, am 20 now. I remember one night sleeping at my grandpas house when I was a lot younger (4-5) and I remember one night waking up in the same bed in the same room I went to sleep in but I couldn’t move and then all of a sudden I started floating out of my body and as I was floating out of my body I turned 180 degrees (as I was floating out of my body I was facing the ceiling ascending towards the ceiling but then I flipped towards the bed but I wasn’t the one who moved me it just naturally happened like there was no gravity in the room) and as I did I saw my body laying in the bed sleeping and now when I think about it it was like my spirit left my body. After I saw myself I kept spinning but slowly as I started to ascend further to the ceiling and then I specifically remember it feeling as if I was becoming apart of the ceiling (similar to trip reports of Salvia where people say they feel they become inanimate objects) and then I remember opening my eyes and I was in my bed and it was late at night and I remember feeling cold, dissociated and very confused. I’ve never had this happen to me again and the closest thing I have experienced to this has been from DMT and other hallucinogens. Any thoughts??",1
I don’t know if this is sleep paralysis but I’m pretty sure it is,So sometimes I’ll wake up in the middle of the night unable to move. I fight my way out of usually and try to lay back down then all of a sudden I’m unable to move again. I’m not scared it’s just really weird and it happens a lot.,1
I always have the same sleep paralysis dream ?,I always dream a black figure stood over my bed and I can’t move at all but this only ever lasts around 10 seconds,1
LF Help: My partner felt a similar presence to me when I woke up from an episode,"Last night I had an episode and when I woke up I didn’t feel real and my partner could also feel a presence or weird energy within the room and we both especially her are completely freaked 
Last night I had a very strange episode I haven’t had one since like 10 years ago when I was younger and was held down in my bed by some weird thing that was clear as day. 
But anyway back to last night. I couldn’t sleep all night and the literal 10 minutes of sleep I got just as I woke up I couldn’t move I was trying so hard to make a sound so my partner could hear but I could only feel myself breathing heavier. I was laying on my stomach and I tried to roll over and with doing so I felt like my soul was being ripped from my body instead of my body moving and then I heard this massive scream as I felt my the non physical version of my head be slammed back into line with my physical head and I woke up. My partner felt my body and I apparently had scary big goosebumps, I was explaining to her that I genuinely don’t feel real like something is completely wrong with the space it was like a shitty recreation of it. Even her dogs were acting really strange as well one kept jumping as if it was startled and the other didn’t want to come up on the bed. 
She’s really concerned as she never experienced things like this for herself, she has a lot of dreams but none that ever leave her worried about anything where as me on the other hand I rarely ever have them and when I do they are extremely violent. 
I told her I would look around and find stuff out so if there’s anyone with any knowledge or knows of somewhere they can point me to it would be greatly appreciated. 
Also sorry for the long post x",1
Weird sounds,"Hey guys, it’s late so I’m going to keep it short. I listen to a lot of heavy music and love horror. I’ve had several occurrences of what I know to be sleep paralysis, although I doubted it at first. I’ll tell those stories if you’re at all interested at all in the comments. But lately I’ve been hearing very faint voices and maybe what sounds like breathing. But the part that really gets me, is it almost sounds like it’s coming from my pillow sometimes. This past week I’ve been waking up very abruptly and with a beating chest. I cannot hear my neighbors as loud as this, and I even hear scratching or doors closing when I know my roommate is asleep. I sound crazy but it’s making it hard for me to sleep. Was hoping someone else has had this happen. Thanks for reading.",1
Sleep paralysis suddenly stopped?,"I used to live in this house that was abandoned before, my dad had bought it and rebuilt it. I started to get sleep paralysis every night though, sometimes i would wake up on the couch or on my bed, i was sleeping in a different spot. Every time i'd get a sleep paralysis there was a shadow always standing in front of me, it always gave me negative energy, it got so bad that i stopped sleeping completely that i would pull all nighters and only get a blink of sleep once the sun started to rise.

But the dreams i would have before the sleep paralysis would always be something related to the future or sinister dreams. I would often wake up with scratches on my legs or red marks, the ones where if someone grabbed you too hard it would leave a red mark, on my body sometimes.

I moved from that house since then and the sleep paralysis have stopped, but every time I think about it or talk about it I get nightmares.

 I'm not sure what was in that house or who but it changed a lot of things for me.",1
Carol Anne...,"So, I have no idea how long I was asleep for...
 I crack an eye open bc i hear this weird loud screeching sound..(So, I thought...still not sure)
 I see the TV is on but it looks black?! ( I fell asleep to This show called Community) I'm thinking another episode is about to come on... Nope nothing...
 I try to reach for the remote.....

I CAN'T MOVE...(o snap, is this what I think it is?)
Okay... let me try and get up....(crap..., still nothing.. wtheck) 
I have my cell in my hand. I try to move my arm so I can knock my phone up against the head board... (still  can not move. This time feels different bc my ears are ringing and I have a headache from that noise)....

So, I close my eyes... i open them again and sure enough I see this small round figure (dark shadow on my chest. No eyes no face. Sitting on top of me. In my head I am cussing this thang out...lol)

Dang.... why is my breathing shallow?! (This time is different) 
I close my eyes again. Take a deep breath. Tell myself I am dreaming and this is sleep paralysis..

As soon as i come too, I open my eyes and sit straight up, jump out the bed stumble around the room turn off the TV go to our son's room to check on them. I check on my hubby stumbling down the steps. Heart beating fast and hard.
Go to the bathroom to fall of the seat....( i laugh and cry and the same time...) 

Once I finish, I sit back on the bed and look around the room. Tell myself that was a wild ride..... 
This one was extremely intense to the point i never went back to sleep....

It gave me that Poltergeist type of vibe. I was terrified of that movie as a kid...

I was waiting to see that lady that always called out for Carole Anne!!",1
Short story,"So it was about 2AM and i was watching YouTube (I am a Over nighter).When I felt like I was tired, I slept.At around 3AM (I think that was the time because usually that's the devil's hour (correct me if I am wrong)) I woke up and realized I was facing my house ceiling (I usually sleep on my side) and couldn't move but suddenly I felt like something was picking me up but I couldn't feel the thing (Like when a Person gets possessed and rises up from their bed).I was laying in there helpless and paralyzed and that thing let go of me and I fell asleep with no nightmares. I told my dad and he said some demon possessed me.I now don't get sleep paralysis as often.Also I did not see any demon figures or shadows.",1
An experience I had in sleep paralysis,"This is going to be short because I can't remember much from the event this happened 2 years ago 

 I think it was 3 or 4 am I was running on coffee and had I guess a caffeine crash my eyes got heavy and I couldn't move and I fell asleep somewhere throughout the night I woke up unable to move I heard my door open and heard my fathers voice say can you be a bit quiet and this distorted humanoid figure came into my room it walked up to me and just stared at me it had no facial features other than two white eyes it turned off my tv and said in a distorted voice I never heard before thanks when I was able to move my tv was actually off it can't turn its self off it never turned off by it's self again and it never did before other than that night",1
Weird sound during sleep paralysis,"So, I’ve only ever had one “serious” sleep paralysis in all my life, after that I learned to recognise it and it only happened again two or three times while having a nap during the afternoon but they were always manageable because I wasn’t deeply asleep and I snapped out of them almost immediately. 
The first one though was really rough. I was dreaming and (long story short) I recognised that It was a dream when the person I was talking to in the dream said something so unusual that it immediately “clicked” and in an instant I realised that it wasn’t real, and I woke up immediately. Of course, as sleep paralysis goes, I couldn’t move, not a muscle, nothing, I don’t even remember if my eyes were closed or not. I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary and I don’t remember how long I spent thinking about how I was probably having a stroke or some shit like that. I tried talking, screaming, moving my fingers and, of course, nothing worked. So I slowly started “accepting” that whatever was happening wasn’t gonna miraculously change because of me panicking so I started calming down. THAT’S when I realised that I was literally not hearing what was around me, It was SO MUFFLED like I was trapped deep inside my mind and couldn’t quite reach out of it, it felt like being underwater, and till this day I still remember how awful it was, not only it was muffled but also there was this constant ringing in my ear that was SO SO LOUD and let me be clear I never suffered of tinnitus nor do I suffer from it now. After I started calming down I eventually started hearing normally again and as I was regaining consciousness the feeling of being underwater eventually faded along with the ringing. Still to this day I remember vividly how much it felt like I was trapped inside my head. As anyone experienced this?",1
My first happen today.,"So here is how it went:
My cat has been waking and keeping me up at 4am for the past 2 or 3 days, she did it again today. She usually sleeps with me but has decided to sleep alone downstairs but I still keep my door open for her to come in if she wants to.
I was really tired and today is my first entire day off work in a while so I kick her out of my room and close the door.

I lay there for maybe 15min before I fall back asleep in my left side. I’m having these vivid dreams but then I’m awoken by a rush of absolute and sudden energy pushing through me. I feel the energy go through my face, chest, stomach, all the way to my toes and fingers. It all happened in about 3 slow seconds and as it is pushing through, I’m being moved.

My body is on the left side of the bed, the right side has a body pillow, and I’m laying on the left side of my body. It went from completely on my side to almost laying on my back, my legs are still the same and I can’t move. I am awake. I am numb/emotionally feel nothing and remain calm like nothing is happening, as if not to give the energy a reaction to feed off of. I feel  my body moving but my eyes are closed. The bed is dipping in the middle like someone is there with me, the bed only creaks on the right side of the bed and it doesn’t stop until a large mass presence is in the bed.

Just as soon as I am almost laying on my back, the immediate reverse happens like someone hit rewind. I am slowly being pushed back on my side. The feeling of someone laying there is still in my mind and I’m trying to scream but I can’t breath or move my mouth. I can flutter my eyes open a little but I don’t want to, I want them to think I don’t notice what’s happening to me.
When I go back to my initial state I stay still for a second, waiting for the lump to get out of my bed but it isn’t so I jump out of bed and leave the room.

The entire encounter would have been short, I was only asleep for 20 minutes.
I would have preferred a different first experience but shit happens.

TL;DR: I was spooked and didn’t like it when the thing that came into bed with me pushed me on my back. In the end, I’m a lil bitch.

Pls share similarities or ideas, I’d like to know what you guys think!",1
A reoccurring dream which seems like sleep paralysis but I’m not quite sure,"Reoccuring Dream. Unsure of what it is. I think it’s sleep paralysis or some strange version of it.

I’ve been having this reoccurring dream. 

The dream: I wake up in my bed. My bedroom is all the same, but I can’t move but I can consciously think. However, my thoughts are primarily scary images and whenever they flash through my head, my pulse starts racing and I feel like my body is convulsing. I thought this was sleep paralysis, but the thing is that I can move my body but it just takes a lot of effort. I end up rolling out of bed but before I land, I suddenly am back in the bed and I still can’t move. This happens for a while until I actually wake up.

Any Thoughts?

 this also only happens during naps which are longer than like 30 minutes",1
Housemate & I experience sp at same time,"My housemate & I moved into a new house in September last year. Neither of us had ever experienced sp before living here, but since then we’ve both had it several times, often with quite similar experiences. The first time, a couple nights apart, we both experienced being stuck in our bedrooms with a figure touching our hair, unable to move or scream. We’ve both had it a few times since then in similar ways too. Then last night, we both experienced it during the same time at night. I was having a creepy, but normal dream, but it turned into me being in my bed, feeling like the person from my dream was now in my room, pushing my neck into the pillow & choking me. I woke up still feeling pain & pressure on my neck, and also my tv turned on randomly as I woke up? Her experience at the same time was that she was falling asleep, but got stuck half way with awareness of her surroundings in her room but unable to wake up or open her eyes. Any ideas as to what’s going on ?!",1
"Just had SP for first time in a couple of years, just thought I would list the triggers in case anyone finds it helpful. One trigger is I am unwell atm and unable to fall into a deep enough sleep (I have a head cold) and number two is I have been watching horror movies with my son which just seeped",into the SP. I felt tje hairs on my back rise and so I told myself to wake up and I managed to wake up almost instantly. This is going to be a problem tonight without being able to fall into a deep sleep.,1

My sleep paralysis has changed over the years,"My sleep paralysis has changed over the years, and I don't think it's just that I've gotten better at dealing with it, it really feels like a completely different experience. 

&#x200B;

Before: I would ""wake up"" and realize that I can't move. I would try moving my arm, my finger, anything, and I would push and push and it would feel like I could almost move it but it never would move. It kind of felt like when you're underwater and you run out of air, so you start swimming to the surface, and you can see that the surface is getting closer and closer but you can never actually reach it, and your air is running out more and more. So my heart would start racing and I would be fighting with everything I have just to move my arm a little bit, and eventually I would ""break the surface"" and be able to move again. So I would wake up properly and be exhausted from fighting to move. My sleep paralysis was very consistently like this for \~10 years. The only inconsistent part is that sometimes I felt a presence in my room and sometimes I didn't.

&#x200B;

Now: I would ""wake up"" and feel completely normal. Let's say I wanted to move my leg and let it dangle off the side of my bed - I would hear the sound of the duvet rustling as I moved my leg, I would feel the carpet when my foot touched the floor, etc. The only weird thing is that when I looked down, my leg was still under the duvet. It didn't feel like I was straining to move, everything felt completely normal, it just felt like my eyes weren't in sync with the rest of my senses. And when I eventually woke up properly, it wasn't some huge climax where I was finally able to move again, it was just like gradually my eyes started to be able to see my movements again. My sleep paralysis has been very consistent like this for the past \~2-3 years.

Has anyone else had their sleep paralysis change? I think mine changed when I moved apartments, so maybe the new environment is why it's different now.",1
Lucid dream but also sleep paralysis? One of the most horrifying nights of my life.,"Copied/reposted from myself on r/LucidDreaming

I [23F] have been lucid dreaming since I was like 9 or 10. For as long as I can remember I’ve been able to manipulate and realize that I’m dreaming. A year or so ago I read an article on the song “Weightless” by Marconi Union being the most hypnotizing song that it’s considered dangerous to drive to, and I was having trouble sleeping so I put the song on, and “fell asleep,” only to realize I was listening to this hypnotic song in full sleep paralysis, aware that I couldn’t move. That was the first time I experienced sleep paralysis.

Two nights ago I was staying at my “boyfriend’s” apartment and couldn’t sleep for some reason. Around 23:45 I started to “sleep” but my mind was still racing and I quickly realized I couldn’t move even if I tried. What felt like 20 minutes later, I snapped out of the paralysis but it was about 01:30. I couldn’t fall back asleep, so I laid on my back (normally the only way I can fall asleep quickly while being determined to lucid dream) and started counting to and from one hundred until I got distracted with creating peaceful visuals of where I wanted to dream, visualizing a beach.

This is where things got really terrifying. My eyes were closed and I knew I was dreaming, but I saw his bedroom exactly how it was, but when I looked at the ceiling I saw sand and an ocean at sunset. It was like the line between the wall and the ceiling was what was real versus a dream, respectively, but my body felt like it was experiencing the dream, like I heard the ocean. I looked up at the ceiling and I had started to walk into the ocean in first-person perspective, then after a few steps it became third-person and I watched myself walk into the ocean until I was completely submerged, and for some reason I couldn’t tell control myself not to. Because my body felt like it was in the dream I felt like I couldn’t breathe and was choking. I looked back down to “reality” and realized I couldn’t move my body to wake up. After what felt like forever I finally broke out of it, woke up (it was around 03:45), and sat up gasping for air (my lungs hurt so I had actually not been breathing) and making exasperated noises/soft screams, loud enough to wake up my boyfriend. I stayed up until noon yesterday then we took a nap and I was fine, but exhausted. When he woke up he asked, “Do you remember waking up having a panic attack?”

Has anyone else ever experienced this or something similar? I’ve been really freaked out by it since it happened.",1
Is this normal? Traumatic and Scary first timer.,"This morning, at 5:58 am, I woke up lightly screaming and couldn’t move my body for 10 seconds. Before this happened, I remembered that while I was dreaming, I could see myself asleep in my room. Next thing you know, in my dream I was in this something point of view. I remembered that this something was walking down the hall to get to my room, and when it opened the door, I was watching myself, still asleep, and the this thing coming in to my room. This thing didn’t have no face or anything, it was just a shadowy figure. As I see that thing come in, I am now in my own perspective in where I wake up in my dream and see that thing leaning it’s head on my chest. One hand was covering my mouth while the other hand was touching my intimate parts. In that moment, I was terrified. I couldn’t move at all and i tried to scream but i couldn’t. It felt so surreal. I tried to calm myself down and then scream as loud as I can. After that, I woke up and look around my room if there was anything suspicious. There was nothing. To make it this situation more worse, I was home alone. I took some time to process what just happened and try to forget about it, but I was just wondering, is this sleep paralysis?",1
Very concerned,"Hello! I don’t personally have sleep paralysis, but my girlfriend does. She sees a tall slender man with a big head (kinda looks like Tor Johnson from Plan 9 from Outer Space with a huge smile wider than his head with bleeding gums and huge eyes). She says she best describes his facial features/details as the way those hyper realistic Sponge Bob close ups look actually. He lanks around her room and crawls on the ceiling till he finally ends up on her bed and staring at her face to face while sitting on her chest. When I first got with her she couldn’t even talk about it without having a full on break down on me. I finally talked her into sitting down with a friend of mine who has a similar dream demon (not sleep paralysis) that would run though his house and kill his family. From talking to both they had similar features. After talking, they both even felt comfortable enough to even draw them. It was very cathartic for the both of them. While she still had sleep paralysis, she actually did not see the “demon” for a very long time. We have been going through a very stressful time as of recent, and she’s started seeing him again. We knew he wasn’t gone forever, but was thankful that she had at least a long stretch without having to deal with him. The problem is that the other day, while driving, in the day time, she glanced in her rear view mirror and saw him plain as day sitting in her backseat. She swerved off the road (very dangerous and is the biggest concern), and glanced back and he was gone. This apparently happen a week or two ago and she is just now telling me. It has me/her very scared and would like to know if anyone on here has experienced this? I have her permission to post this by the way. She is also curious because we have not been able to find ANYTHING online where someone has experienced this. We also do not believe that “Curly” is real, before I get those comments.",1
Falling asleep,"One thing I’ve noticed that usually happens when I get SP is that it feels like I fall asleep too fast. 

The last thing I’ll remember is looking at my phone at 10:04 for example and then the episode happens and feels like it’s been hours but when I finally get out of it the time is only 10:10 and I feel like I’ve lived through 3 hours. 

Has anyone else felt this?",1
Sleep Paralysis Story,"So it started yesterday, when I watched the tapes of Annaliese Michel’s exorcism. If you Google it, it’ll come up, but fair warning, these tapes are extremely frightening. So yesterday night, as I tried to go to sleep, I couldn’t, and I felt like I had a weight on my chest. I was sweating a lot, I was creeped out by the tapes I had watched earlier, and it was a horrible experience. I could not sleep until 2 AM, and I usually get sleepy at around 10 or 11. Thoughts on this? How do I overcome my fear of ghosts and demons and get a good night’s sleep?

Update: When I went to bed yesterday, I was uneasy and then when I put on the comforter I started sweating and it was really hot. But then, I remembered that there’s not a chance in hell that ghosts or demons are real and I managed to get a nice sleep. It also helped that I watched Harry Potter just before going to sleep. :)",1
"Have you ever felt a hand tap you on the shoulder from behind while in bed, knowing there's no room for anyone to lay there?","Rhetorical, mostly.

I get SP episodes a half dozen times a year, and they're usually fleeting, five seconds or so. But 9/10 times, it's not visual for me, it's touch. This one is a favorite of my mind. I sleep on my side, away from the wall, and my bed is a college twin. There's no room for another person unless I'm at the bed's edge, which is not how I regularly sleep, of course.

Three or four quick taps from a finger. Rarely, I'm able to move my eyes or head enough to see the space over my side, and I'll feel my hand clasp against whatever hand was tapping me. Of course, that feeling of clasping hands is detached from wherever my actual hands are.

That's when the hallucination ends, I fully wake up and my body surges with hot adrenaline in a delayed response to existential fear. 

This is the fourth time I've had almost this exact hallucination. I'm more fascinated by SP than I am freaked out, but it's still off-putting. Got something to tell friends at work, today.

I have trouble falling asleep and shaking groginess due to insomnia, so that adrenaline rush from fear actually helps get me up. xD Maybe my tapping dream demon is doing me a solid.",1
Drone at the end of my bed,"I’m in the military so it’s 2 people per small room. Myself and my roommate have our shelves set up in between our beds to act as a privacy wall. There is a very small walk way from his side of the room to mine. Almost every night shortly after falling asleep I wake up in sort of a panic and for a few seconds to even minutes i see a drone type object floating in the walk way next to the shelves at the foot of my bed. I always just stare at it and it feels like it is starting right back at me but as soon as I gather myself and move ever so slightly, it’s gone. I’ve had 2 different roommates and neither of them have seen or dealt with anything similar to this. I always have trouble falling asleep after this so I have many restless nights. Has anyone else ever experienced this? Maybe I’m just still in a dream state but it’s beginning to hinder my work ethic.",1
Been having stressful and subtlety disturbing dreams the past three days (including SP),"Nothing that is cartoonishly horrific/ horror movie tier but subtlety disturbing and just stressful I'll sum it up in three days and one of the days included a brief sp experience.


Day 1. 
- was relaxing in a resort that suddenly turned into a battlefield and I was now fighting in a ww1 style arena, very stressful experience and my teamates looked slightly deformed, kinda like bad video game rendering and I kept getting quickscoped by dudes in top hats and Victorian era clothing. (I could respawn like a videogame). Felt like I did not get a good rest when I woke up

Stress factor: high,  Disturbing factor: Mild,  Interest factor: Low


Day 2.
- was participating in a complicated war game against demon forces in some oasis in the desert. The fighting was happening using telepathy and recon tactics. They took the form of robotic Teletubbies. From what I remember it was mainly at a stalemate until towards the end of the dream everything thing started glitching, like the matrix was being broken and I was started to wake up, but I felt paralysed. Opened my eyes to discover I'm in SP so I quickly tightly shut my eyes and instinctively moved my fingers and toes, suddenly I was out of the paralysis after a few seconds. 

Stress factor : moderate Disturbing factor: high Interest factor : mild


Day 3. 

- had a dream that me and my family time traveled to a dystopian futuristic city and were stuck there, was quite fascinating and TV show worthy, at one point I was in a hotel room with my family and they started morphing from teenagers to old people as a side effect of time travel, so I just left the room and noped out. Decided to pick up some girls at futuristic Starbucks and made out with one in the moon light which was pretty nice tbh. There were disturbing and scary parts of the dream though
• run into a child molesting ring and saw some disturbing stuff, it had a happy ending because I called my deceased brother and we both fought the child molester and rescued the children 
• the dream took place over several days so I could sleep in the dream, one time I caught camera footage of my entire family watching me sleep at what looked like a futuristic operating table, and they were observing me twitch my fingers and toes?  

Stress factor: mild, Disturbing factor: moderate Interesting factor: high",1
A witch messing with my brother,"Years ago, my brother woke up to an annoying noise, he described it like a rat or something scratching the surface of the wall, he claims to have never been fearful as he stood up repeatedly to yell ""fuck off, you are annoying"", and then feel a sudden sharp pain in his arms. Lights on, he realizes his forearms are scratched in an irregular form, he goes WTF, does not make anything of it then goes back to sleep. It happens a few more times before he tells us, it makes my mother think it is a witch since it checks with the Colombian folklore depiction of a witch (Shady creatures lurking through the night, they fall in love with people, then proceed to take their vitality, making them look unhealthy and unrest and only leaving scratches and bruises behind) so she gets rid of the mattress (some relative had used it and she claimed he was doing witchcraft) and puts crossed scissors under his bed which is what the tradition tells to do. Of course neither me nor my brother believe that stuff, it never happened again.

He has had another episodes, but has never been hurt again.

When this happens to him he does not realize he is asleep, he wakes up, sees the room exactly as it is in real life and stuff happens, once he saw a screaming goblin hit the window of his bedroom really hard as if it was breaking in, he even steps up and turns the light on sees the hour and goes back to sleep, only then he wakes up and realizes that it was all a dream because the real door had no knob and in the dream it had, and the light switch was not on the wall he reached it a minute later, he looks at the hour, and is the exact hour he saw on the dream. 

Does anyone have a possible explanation for the scratching?

Has it happened to you or somebody you know?",1
"So, I've had 3 experiences. At this point, I'm just wondering if there's been some bad juju/spirit following me around lol","So, I've had 3 experiences. At this point, I'm just wondering if there's been some bad juju/spirit following me around lol.

First was a few years ago, sleeping in my brother's room. I was alone at home, so I left the door open, with the rest of the house lights off except for the bedroom. I was sleeping in a really straight position, with the blanket tucked snugly around me. I fell asleep like that. So I ""woke up""/opened my eyes and saw someone (a dude) ahead of me/by the foot of the bed where my brother's dresser was and was tinkling around his stuff on top of the dresser. Then he turned around when he noticed that I was awake and smiled kinda creepily. Then he walked closer and sat on top of my chest-belly area and I remembered I couldn't breathe or move at all. He was smiling the whole time. It lasted from a few seconds to a few minutes, I couldn't tell. And then I moved my head to the side, right where I was looking at the dark hallway outside of my brother's room and woke up. I was in the exact same position as I was in, in my sleep.

That was the first time I've ever had something like that ever happen to me. Now, a few months later, I did find out that the house, especially that room was kinda haunted. So, maybe that was that? But then more than a year or so later, I moved to an apartment in a different city that's very well known for ghost tours and such.

It was around 11am, almost 12 noon, when I would usually wake up. Pretty straightforward. Someone just crawled on my bed, a girl in white with short hair but long bangs covering her eyes, and sat on my stomach and started choking me (she seemed angry). I really couldn't breathe then. I was clawing at my throat when I woke up after I moved my head, and for a split second, the girl was still on top of me before disappearing. I actually went back to sleep after that happened lol. So I wasn't really scared. I told this story to my roommates and they told me that they've seen/experienced something like this, but not as bad as mine.

Third experience is very recent. Moved to a new place because COVID. It was empty so my bedroom is pretty bare except for a bed and night stand. It's a big room. I was half awake? I don't know, but I felt pretty conscious in my ""dream"". In it, there was another bed next to mine in the bedroom that looked slept in and a chair in the corner. Someone I know was sitting, very stiffly, on the corner. I said sorry for waking up late but she just smiled and nodded. I was still lying down, curled on my side, when I ""woke up"", but I realized again that I was still in a dream. The other bed and chair was gone, but for some reason, I knew that the other person was something else. So I told it to ""leave me alone, it was my room now"". And I could just feel this really angry aura (that's the best I could describe the feeling) and someone sitting on the space behind me on the bed. I literally felt the bed dip. And it was suddenly so cold and chilly and I felt so heavy, I couldn't breathe. I told it to go away again, but it wouldn't budge although it didn't seem so angry anymore. So I forced myself to really wake up and shot up out of bed really fast. It was the scariest experience compared to the other two.

I felt sick right after. Even hours later, I still felt sick. Like I wanted to throw up.

So yeah, wondering if I have a spirit following me around (because then it has followed me to 2 different countries and states lmao). But man, even years later, I still remember the last 2 ones vividly.

Sorry for the format, or something. Very new here.

Edit: added some details...",1
For the first time i was not scared in my SP and there was a cat - what happened?,"Last night I woke up after 4 hours of sleep which is really uncommom for me. I need my 8 or I am zombie and i never wake up in the middle of sleeping - not even to pee or drink.
After a snack and tv i went back to sleep when the paralysis happen - but it was quite different than anything i have experienced before. I usually cant move, cant scream and feel this horrible terror. But tonight, I felt... ready when it happened. 
I was fighting against it, but not scared - I remember my muscles tense, trying to overcome stillness and i moved a little bit, but it was really tiring. I felt hopeless, trapped. I tried to scream and I did achieve to make a sound - I thought that I do not want to wake up my boyfriend lying next to me, as if i wanted to resolve it on my own, not to alarm him. But he was still asleep so I knew it is still a dream.
Then I looked up and there it was - white cat was sitting next to my head. I was not scared, just surprised - it felt like it is supposed to be there.
Even more bizarre - right after it i did not wake up, sp changed to the dream where i was trying to solve what just happened - if the cat was guide or if it meant there was a ghost etc - just trying to understand it in another dream. But nothing came out of it, I just woke up really tired.
I am still quite puzzled by it, I usually know why I have dreams/sp, i know what i am trying to process in a dream - but not now. i have a feeling that it really meant something but cant wrap my head around it.
I had an animal in my sp before, it was a dog but i knew he was there to protect me. This white cat was something entirely different. 
Does anybody have an experience with it?
What could be the trigger for my subconcsious?",1
Did I “almost” have sleep paralysis?,"I recently watched a YouTube video about sleep paralysis and I remembered an experience I had a few months back. I never had sleep paralysis in my life and I wonder if this was my closest to have it? So I woke up in the middle of the night because I thought I heard something in my room. 

I opened my eyes and to my surprise, I couldn’t stand up. I didn’t freak out initially for some reason, I was in a very relaxed state. I tried moving again and again and I still couldn’t. I could easily move my fingers tho. Then it hit me: “am I having sleep paralysis??!!”

And I instantly stood up. The whole thing lasted for like 15 seconds. I didn’t have any hallucinations. Was this sleep paralysis? Can you actually have such a short sleep paralysis without any hallucinations?",1
It felt like a seizure.,"This is my first post here and it's about the first time, according to my physician, that I experienced sleep paralysis. I was hoping to post it here to see if there were any symbolic similarities that I share with others and hopefully get a better understanding of what happened. 
Sorry in advance, it's going to be a long post. 
It happened about two weeks ago. I have been trying to meditate nightly to strengthen my spirituality and help with my anxiety, and when I do I try to picture myself walking through the forest (goofy, but it helps). This night was the same as any other, however as I was walking through the forest everything became very dark to the point where I couldn't see. It felt like I was drifting off, but my mind was still very active and I knew I was still awake. In the darkness I started to hear dripping water, and my feet felt very cold and wet. As I was wandering through the darkness I found a bright red door, and the only focus I had was to open it and find what's on the other side. It scared me because I'm a strong believer of the paranormal and I've always known a door meant a gateway, and gateways can lead to anything. When I walked through the door I was right back in my bed, in the same position I was meditating in. I could see everything around me, but I know for a fact my eyes were closed. My entire body started to twitch and shake uncontrollably. I seriously thought I was having a seizure. I tried to look around my room, but was stuck in just one view. There were large grey figures in my room, and they didn't look human. There was one crawling along my floor, a few standing over me, and one lying on the ceiling. It scared the hell out of me. I felt like I was fighting to wake up, but no matter what I could not get my eyes to open. The only thing that woke me up was my boyfriend next to me had started to stir, probably because my body was moving like a fish out of water. When I sat up I had to spend several minutes trying to catch my breath and I couldn't stop crying. My entire body hurt for days after it happened, like I just ran a marathon. I told my boyfriend what happened, and he thought it was best to talk with my doctor. I've had the hardest time with sleeping since then because I'm scared of what I might see if it happens again. I'm even worried about meditating. My doc switched around some of my medicine to see if that would help, but I don't know if that will work or not. 
Does anyone have advice for how to move past it, or not be afraid when it happens? 
If you made it through this post, thank you for reading it. I appreciate any help I can get.",1
Weird sleep paralysis(?) incident,"The other night I had something weird happen to me. I’m a diagnosed insomniac so I wake up quite frequently in the night when I do sleep. Usually waking up constantly in the night triggers sleep paralysis for me. This night in particular though I kept waking up with the feeling of the area under my right boob being tickled. It was extremely uncomfortable and almost painful from the discomfort. I actually was able to move my body perfectly fine, it was just this sensation that wouldn’t go away. I’ve been “tickled” in my SP before and it was this same feeling only I was mobile. I even thought at one point that I should try to shake off the feeling ASAP, otherwise I’m guaranteed to wake up in SP the next time I woke up. I ended up just staying awake the rest of the night because I was too afraid of either waking up paralyzed or waking up being tickled, or even worse both. Has anyone else had an experience like this before? I figured someone who faces sleep paralysis often might have a similar story. Not sure but being tickled in my sleep seems to have been a fear instilled in my head the minute I had reoccurring nightmares as a child being tickled by my toys that suddenly started moving on their own. Not sure what to do about it either",1
"The weirdest thing, still terrified to this day.","Ever since I was a child I have always had a fear of aliens (stupid I know) I think this was caused by staying up late to watch episodes of the X-files when I was younger. Anyway I have occasionally woke up to sleep paralysis and could hear the TV or radio playing that was still turned on when I fell asleep, occasionally sense something in the room, nothing too bad. This one night I woke up in a sleep paralysis and I swear this small goblin looking creature crawled up on top of me knowing how terrified I was and whispered into my ear “I’m an alien” in a sinister tone, almost as if it knew this was a fear of mine that I have told nobody else ever. 

This was either my mind playing tricks on me or this creature was aware, I could sense only evil intentions from it as it just sat on top of me close to my head. 

The house we lived in had a wooden floor that would make a noise only when stepped on at a specific point and I would occasionally hear this late at night, also a taxi driver once told me that a ghost pushed his friend down the stairs one night in that house years ago but I assumed he was just joking, no idea if it’s true or related to this.",1
First time Sleep Paralysis?,"I've read the noted post to stop posting ""Is this sleep paralysis"" but I feel my situation was unique and I'm not sure if it was a Psychotic episode or in fact Sleep Paralysis. For reference I have ADD, Severe Anxiety, Depression and likely hood of Bipolar Disorder.

Huge Paragraphs ahead.

I generally have trouble sleeping and can sometimes wake up multiple times through out the night, 'usually' I'm still in a half state of dreaming and if I wanted to could wake up fully even while dreaming still, other times I properly wake with clear memory of the previous dream and I'm up for about 10 minutes before falling asleep again.

Last night however I woke up with a blank slate of mind and just kept my eyes closed trying to fall asleep again. Then I felt a presence and started hearing unintelligible voices (not whispering) in what would be the middle of my room and the presence felt unnatural and malicious, I then felt an odd strong sensation that went from my lower abdomen up to my chest and spread to my arms this is when the voice became louder.

The sensation faded then the voices stopped for 4 seconds I could then 'sense' the presence shift a bit closer I then hear my mothers voice where the presence was and I could 'sense' the presence shift closer with the voice of my mum moving with it and she was trying to coax me into opening my eyes and look at her and to reach out and hold her. I tried to move my arm in order to turn and face the other way because I knew it can't be real but I was feeling the sensation that I was lifting my arm, but I could really feel that it was in fact not moving, it was as if I had 2 arms but the fake one would lock back to where the real one was after a few seconds of trying to move it. This repeated a few times, meanwhile the voice is getting more persistent and changing slightly to something that kind of sounded like my mum but not really. And then with what took great strength I managed to somehow move my arm and turn around and put the covers over my head. I could sense the presence move closer and different voices of 3 other people 1 which was recognisable calling me to turn around. Then the sensation from my abdomen upwards happened again and the voice became unintelligible again before I then felt the presence move closer to me and I it then felt like it laid in the bed next to me, as in I could feel the bed weight shifted like some one got in. And a different voice to all the others was telling me to turn around and open my eyes to it.

I literally put my hands together and tried praying for my life and after a while I reached for my lamp and turned it on keeping my eyes closed and after 4 seconds I opened them to turn around and of course nothing was there. but I could still sense the presence on my bed, although not as strongly until I left my room. This was the single most terrifying moment of my life, and I work security and have had to restrain and fight murderers with a high likely hood of me dying.

This seemed like it could be sleep paralysis but I'm not sure because I could move, even if it took a lot of effort. Sorry for the huge paragraph also. Delete if not allowed.",1
Crawling,"I used to get sleep paralysis a hell of a lot more than I do now but one of the weirdest was if I fell asleep on my front I would feel something slowly creep up my legs then back until it got to my neck.

Paralysis by a shape-shifting entity,"I just wanted to share my SP experience about a night ago.First off,  I've (over 30 F) only had a paralysis twice in my life: partial paralysis of an unknown nature over a year ago, and a full paralysis just recently.

I'm a rational person, majoring in psychology in the past, and I don't believe in paranormal. I do recall eating before going to bed, and I've read somewhere there might be a connection between getting late night snacks and the paralyzing nightmare.

It started in a very innocent way, but rapidly took a real dark turn. So here goes:

I see my mother's- in-law cute little white dog across the bed (the dog that me and my husband often like to play with). I look at the puppy and tell him that ""I love him"". The dog stares back at me and then slowly starts shape shifting into a white cat. The white cat is replying back to me in a rhetorical question: ""You love me? "" - with a sinister, sceptical, malicious undertone.Then the cat is shape- shifting into a huge, tall amorphous demonic creature, that I cannot see, but I feel its evil intentions, I see its enormous growing white form engulfing me, and I'm feeling ""it"" with my whole body, and that's when the complete paralysis consumes my body. 

I'm trying to get away from it, already half awake, but cannot move, and I feel the deep guttural buzzing or humming vibrations, like during the earthquake, it's pressing against my body and immobilizing the ending of my nerves and muscles. The paralysis is pinning me to the bed mattress and electrocuting through my body. Unable to call for help, move, or utter a word, I'm absolutely horrified. Only after a few minutes it lets go of me and I manage to get free. It was the creepiest shit that I ever had to experience in my dream. That paralysis  part  is absolutely out of this world. It's got such a real unsettling feeling to it, it almost feels like a claustrophobia in the most intense form. Extremely disturbing.

My theory is that the corona virus quarantine resulted in a quiet unhealthy lifestyle- lack of exercise, late night eating, lack of activities, being stuck in the house etc. So this new adopted lifestyle is the only rational explanation I found for this noval ""sleep paralysis"" occurrence of mine.

However, there is something extremely unnatural in not having a control over your own body during the paralysis. It really feels like a ""foreign entity"" is constraining your body.That's why, in my opinion, people, experiencing SP since the dawn of time, used to connect it with the supernatural.I have done the research on the topic, read the historic files, the collective unexplained phenomena, including the mass deaths during the sleep. And after analyzing it, I decided to keep my mind open, because some facts and other people's documented experiences still cannot be rationalized and explained with the critical thinking.

""What we know is a drop, but what we don't know is an ocean..""( c)",1
do you have any cool/positive/memorable sp experiences?,"I used to get sleep paralysis every other day so I do know how terrifying it is, but this one time instead of a shadow person choking me I saw a huge glowing winged angel sitting on my chest illuminating my whole room. I didn’t even realize I couldn’t breathe or move at first bc I was just in awe. I felt so safe, then it faded away like normal. I’m not really religious but I was raised catholic so it definitely awoke certain feelings in me haha. I did keep having scary demon paralysis after that tho :\",1
Sleep Paralysis at Work Story.,"So I was in the back of the truck sleeping on my back. It was about an hour and half trip. When we arrived I was sleeping. The driver and passenger said, ""wer'e here you awake""?. Although I heard them say it out loud, I couldn't respond. I tryed to talk, but of course nothing came out.So the passenger hit me in the leg which I saw him do and saw him smiling. I was aware I had to get up but was stuck for a couple seconds, all the while I had full vision of what was happening around me. So when I got up and started to work, I asked my co worker in the passenger seat if my eyes were closed, and he said yeah you were out cold dude. I then told him that I heard everything and saw him hit me on the leg. Now when I told him he had a smile on his face, he got weirded out. Now the two guys I work with think I'm a freak. This was the first time I had sleep paralysis with a live audience, and saw everything happening with my eyes closed. I get sleep paralysis all the time but this one changed me a little bit.",1
Vibrating nightmare,"So, Every once in a while I have this nightmares that consist of some combination of dark colors, sometimes they are more elaborate and feel like a dark (or in a low light environment) bleeding wall, but the more annoying thing about it is that I start feeling very uneasy and my body starts violently vibrating , and I say vibrating because it does not feel like shaking (like when shaking from cold), more like when you try to force your asleep leg to move. I try to sleep trough it but its gets worse and worse until I have to force myself to wake up. Then I fall asleep again and it keeps happening and it only stops when I go and sleep next to a member of my family.

This makes me wonder, 

Has anyone experienced the same?

Why a bleeding wall and nothing else?

Why the vibration?

Considering that it might be related to bad sleep habits, then why does it stop when I sleep next to someone else?",1
My tips to control sp,"My first step is trying to control your breath, I just breathe heavy since I have trouble breathing. Trying to have a consistent breathing rhythm is key to not freak out in sp. my second tip is trying to see if your finger or toes move, I can barely wiggle my toes and fingers but it’s a key to wake up from sp. if you lay on your back and get sp, try to lay on your side, you can’t due to sp but your brain will try and possibly wake you up. Another tip is just closing your eyes and move your eyes left and right continuously.",1
New guy looking for help...,"I'm not new to SP but I am new to Reddit so I'm not sure if I'm in the right place. You could call me a ""social media novice"" as I mainly only go online for my news & current events, a little shopping and researching topics of interest. I found Reddit while looking into forums for other sufferers of SP and figured I'd give it a shot since Dr's & in person support groups haven't been much help. I'm really hoping someone in this venue might have some helpful advice for reducing how frequently my episodes of SP occur and maybe even some tips on alleviating their severity as well. It's gotten so bad recently I'm literally terrified to lay down at night and it's really starting to negatively impact every other aspect of my life. My wife says I have a tendency to be long winded and for over explaining myself but I'm literally begging anyone who might be reading this to please stick with me here.

Just to give everyone a little background on myself here. My SP first began in my mid-teens, along with my bouts of anxiety & depression. Friends would say I was just making it up when I'd ask if anything similar ever happened to them. My mom was scared I had a brain tumor or something when I described what was going on with me, which didn't do a whole lot for my anxiety. Our family Dr said he was pretty sure it was SP and referred us to a specialist but my family didn't have a lot of money and our state run insurance wouldn't cover it. I didn't get confirmation until I had decent insurance through my employer, years later.

The past 20+ years I've dealt with extended periods of several episodes every night or having no episodes at all and everything in between. The past few years I've experienced relatively infrequent episodes up until recently. Maybe once or twice a month, shortly after falling asleep or just before waking up I'd have a relatively mild instance but not much more. About 6 weeks ago, my wife & I had our offer accepted for our new home and my episodes became more frequent with increased severity. I'd hoped after everything was finalized and we'd moved in, everything would settle down a little. However my SP escalated to an extent I'd never previously experienced since it first started.

Despite the fact I've been dealing with SP most of my life, I still have trouble recognizing when it's happening. Once I do realize what's going on, I usually have little trouble relaxing and focusing on my breathing. Then I'll concentrate on moving whichever appendage is least restricted by the position I was asleep in until my entire body follows suit. If my wife's present when it happens, she'll help rouse me fully awake. Again this  would usually occur shortly after falling asleep or just before waking up. When it occurs right after falling asleep I usually fall right back asleep, which wasn't so easy when I was younger and not used to it. Rarely would I have back to back instances and never did I have more than two within the span of a few minutes but that's changed a great deal now.

Since moving in to our new home I now have multiple episodes, EVERY SINGLE NIGHT, right after falling asleep AND just before waking up! Even after recognizing what's happening, it's nearly impossible for me to focus on breathing effectively. I go into a full on panic, terrified I'll suffocate and unable to concentrate on moving a hand or foot in order to ""activate"" the rest of my body. Most times I end up flinging myself onto the floor upon regaining the ability to move. I haven't severely injured myself yet but I've hit my head on the nightstand and deeply bruised various parts of my body. I've had times where I'd have another episode of SP within a few minutes of falling back asleep after the first one but that was far from normal. Now having 3 or 4 instances within a few minutes of each other, one after another after another is an every night occurrence. From my own research, I know many sufferers of SP will sometimes have other symptoms besides what has been my usual experience. Some people see a dark figure in their peripheral vision, feeling as if they're being physical restrained or have something of very larger mass weighing on them down. Prior to my more recent episodes I'd never endured any of those things for myself. Now all of those symptoms manifest themselves during every instance of SP I have had over the past few weeks. I'm scared, I'm lost and at my wits end. 

I'm constantly angry and lash out multiple times a day at my wife who is trying her best to be supportive & caring. I work 2nd shift and I'm exhausted every moment of the day. It takes everything I have to make it through work each day and I've become even more antisocial than I already was. At this point I'm just not myself and I don't want to go through this anymore. Right now it's 3:00am and all I want is to lay down next to my wife and go to sleep but I'm absolutely terrified. What if I'm unable to maintain some sense of my faculties next time and I do actually suffocate? What if the next time I go hurtling out of bed I break my neck or fracture my skull? Right now it would help a whole lot for someone to tell me they've dealt with SP at a similar rate but they were able to get through it.

If anyone has had SP affect them to the same extent and were unable to do anything to make it easier I'd like to at least know you got through it. Even if you just had to deal with it until it was better one day, that would at least give me a little hope. Just knowing there's others who've been where I am and are still here would mean so much right now. I'm hoping someone can share something that's worked for them but I'd settle for just knowing this won't last forever. I honestly don't know how much more I can possibly endure. Without just a tiny ray of sunshine breaking through the clouds sometime soon I'm not sure what I'm going to do.",1
Is it sleep paralysis?,"Hi , I’m new here so apologies if i’ve not got the lingo/format etc correct.

So basically i’ve “thought” i’ve had sleep paralysis for years now. It started off with a recurring “dream” of a woman standing at the side of my bed and me screaming and then thinking i had woke up but then she’d be floating above me and repeat, repeat until I actually woke up.

Slowly things began to get less scary as I was able to tell myself “make it happy” or “you’re dreaming” and it would be over pretty quickly.

Tonight felt different.

Admittedly my sleeping schedule has been all over the place during lockdown & I had a busy day so went to bed around 9pm and was asleep probably before 10pm. 

In the dream I was lying in bed on my phone but could feel a “presence” so I looked up and I was floating above myself. I then switched places with the me in the bed, to floating me. The me in the bed then opened her mouth in an impossibly wide, terrifying manner and spewed out black liquid whilst making a screeching sound. Floating me then morphed back into bed me. So I tried to scream myself awake. I thought I was awake but then I looked over at my mirror and it was wavy/warped and out popped another me who came running out at me looking possessed - I tried screaming for my dad (hoping he would wake me) but the words were getting more quiet with every scream. Thought I was awake again but this time I just simply couldn’t move my body (apart from my arms) so I began banging on my bedroom wall to try alert my brother to wake me up ( because I knew I was dreaming ) but again - no cigar. A couple more of these weird situations happened and then I then looked over and a young me told myself “pretend this is a happy dream” and I sort of imagined a “happy atmosphere” and immediately woke up , sweating and realised it was all just one long dream and I hadn’t actually been screaming for help or banging on the walls. 

So, is this sleep paralysis or something different? just felt a lot more overwhelming than I remember. 

Thanks",1
How to wake up(from my experience),"Straight to the point: move your eyes as farrrr back and side to side. And I meannn farrr move your eyes around as back as they can go. This caused to me get up since my eyes were basically awake from the pain of rolling it so far back.
I used to sleep in class and I would get sleep paralysis. I tried waking up but nothing worked so I rolled my eyes around very far back and far right and left and I woke up! I don’t get sleep paralysis anymore but whenever I did the first thing I would do is do that trick and boom I was up.",1
Good SP???,"I’ve never actually experienced SP before until earlier today while “sleeping” I wouldn’t call it sleep paralysis but I had the same experience as if I would. This happened about 2 times while I was sleeping on the phone with my girlfriend.

Anyway, I “woke” up in my sleep and realized that I couldn’t move or speak or do anything really, I tried talking but I could only groan but that lasted only about 10 seconds. 

I then fell back to sleep and this is where it gets weird. As most sleep paralysis tends to be evil or scary mine wasn’t. I “woke” up again feeling the same way but this time it looked Ike someone in a white long dress was at the edge of my beds feet. She was staring not at me but toward my wall and I can only see the side of her face. I felt like I could here her talking or something and I knew it wasn’t my girlfriend cuz she fell asleep with me at that time but nothing bad or scary happened. That lasted a little longer about 15 or 20 seconds.

When I woke up I was very confused at what I just witness and woke her up to tell her what just happened and she did say I was groaning in my sleep like I was trying to make words out

2 things: This happened in the morning and the woman looked like she was wearing a pig nose? I’m very confused by what just happened and if anyone can provide some opinions on this it’ll be appreciated.",1
"I return to Sleep paralysis nearly every time I go to sleep, I'm not even sure I ever truly sleep. I have many skills and how to; information when it comes to pushing through to get to the other side and how to overcome and when it's coming on!","(I'm a horendous speller) so bare with me please.

For some time now I have been wanting to tell of my tails whilst I dream, I have the most vivid dreams where I can tell you almost everything around me and the interactions I have with people, entities and things I can only describe as creatures. 

Each time I go to rest my body is over come with sleep paralysis, almost every time! Before when it started many years ago it was that of nightmares and horrors but back then it was once a week and gradually pushed it self on me like a jock at a party that wouldn't stop till it had me where it wanted me!

As time went on I was able to learn how to control the fear and run away from it, push my self to try to take back my dreams and keep the fear out! And I say fear because it's fear that changes my dreams and turns them, it's fear of the unknowing the gives my dream back to them and it's my inability to be strong and PUSH that allows what ever it is that wants control or wants me out and wants my FEAR!!!

So many tails I have, so many years I have experienced, people I have met from other times and other time lines. There are many tricks and things to practice while you start to dip into Sleep Paralysis and once your inside the grasps of SP how to push your way through to a side you can enjoy and explore! I have been wanting to start a tube page or a tic toc to try and help others with this and tell tails and how to fight your own battles. 

Let me know what you think and if that would be something others would want to know? 

Thanks for reading and giving me a little if your time as time is the only thing in the world you can never return! For that I am truly greatful!",1
Open eye hallucinations,"I do have SP every now and then and it’s usually messed up but last night was mild, not sure if it’s SP so i thought i’d share. Over the last few day i’ve not been getting good sleep (wake up multiple times panicking about getting an important email/ final results ..etc). I don’t feel stressed during the day,I honestly don’t but it’s like i’m a afraid if i sleep I’m gonna miss out on something important. So yesterday when i woke up at night I opened my eyes but i was still dreaming, i was hallucinating, seeing weird colorful patterns on the bedroom ceiling shifting and moving, music playing in the background. I woke my boyfriend up asking him if he’s seeing this ( I don’t why i woke him up i just did) he was confused asking me what’s wrong. After a few minutes I realized i was dreaming and told him to go back to sleep because (i’m still dreaming). I woke up this morning with the worst migraine+ tension headache, my neck and shoulders are stiff af. Is this considered sleeping paralysis Or just some weird lucid dream?",1
The scariest thing you've ever seen,I'm writing a horror story about sleep paralysis and want to hear everyone's experiences.,1
Seemingly real intense pain.,"Just about 30 minutes ago (at the time of writing this post) I woke up from the most terrifying nightmare I’ve ever had. I was walking in circles in this dark space, no distinct ground, sky, or walls. I was walking around a blue cartoonish house, surrounded on all sides by a cartoony forest. When I say cartoony I mean it looked like a mediocre hand drawing in completely 2D fashion. However, in the trees, there was this white figure that grew a tiny bit closer every time I looped around the house. After a few loops, I noticed a strange faint ringing sensation accompanied by unintelligible speech and some kind of music I can’t describe: I can only tell you that it was music. After more and more loops and I could clearly see the figure, it was a white smiling circular face (cartoony as well) that seemed to only have a matching white torso with no details floating underneath it. No legs, no arms, nothing else. At this point, I started to hear the music louder, and it made me panic and begin sprinting around this house over and over, with each loop, the ringing and music got louder, but the talking stopped. The music at this point sounded like it had some kind of horn that was starting to hurt my ears really really bad. Then, I woke up. I was still really tired, and definitely freaked out, but I figured I’d be fine to go back to sleep. I closed my eyes and instantly found myself trapped in the same hellish nightmare. I felt an indescribable feeling of dread and anxiety. This time, the figure in the woods was gone, and there was a red figure in a window in the house speaking to me and playing an instrument, which is what I assumed to be a horn for some reason. I woke up again. I fell asleep for the third and final time, and this time was immediately greeted by this red figure directly in front of me, almost absorbing me, with the ringing and blaring music hurting my ears so bad it felt like real pain. I could feel it drilling down through my skull. I heard a child’s voice say “don’t be scared” and after what seemed like forever of this auditory pain, I woke up, and realized immediately I was in sleep paralysis. I felt the usual pressure on my chest, my ears still slightly hurt, but I felt like something was in my bedroom, watching me, waiting for me to fall back asleep. I tried to move but couldn’t, and I started to panic. I thought I was going to die. Then, I snapped out of it and threw my lights on. I’m not sleeping tonight. I still feel as if I’m going to die if I go back to sleep or turn my lights off. I really feel like something is still here watching me and waiting. I feel such an ominous dread and sense of malice that I’m not sure if I can sleep for the rest of the night at all.

I’m not sure if this was too long, but I wanted to share my experience because Ive only had one run in with SP before which was only a few months ago. In the dream beforehand I was on some sort of mineshaft rollercoaster and could really feel the drops. That was fun until a man appeared on the tracks and then I woke up to find a silhouette standing in the corner of the room. I’ve never heard anything in my dreams before, and I’ve definitely never felt real pain like I just did. That’s why this experience is so significant to me. Has anyone here dealt with this kind of thing before?

Edit: I should also mention that it felt like I was being slowly cut down the middle from my tailbone up during the episode of SP.

Another Edit: I’m only a teen going into Senior year of HS. Does this sort of thing usually get more common or can I expect it to get easier to deal with?",1
When SP hit last night it felt like someone was trying to kill me,"I've experienced SP quite a few times in my life but never really got to experience any hallucination, except for last night. I had a really weird dream where I was at a friend's house and one her cats started looking at me and then looking to the left as if someone was behind me. At that point I started to ""wake up"". I was lying on my stomach so I didn't see the creature but I felt a pair of hands tightly locked around my neck as if the creature was about to strangle me, then it felt like someone was trying to sit on my back so I couldn't breathe. I was feeling dizzy even though I was lying in my bed and I kept hearing a weird sound that would start very low and end in a whistle (I've seen people commenting about similar sounds, I actually think it's your blood rushing next to your ears).
Has anyone else experienced an ""attempted murder"" while having SP ?",1
Sleep paralysis + nasal congestion,"Man, it’s the worst. I get SP frequently upon waking up. Since this pretty much only happens during daytime I don’t have issues with creepy hallucinations, but holy crap, I can LITERALLY not breathe. On top of the heavy feeling and all that good stuff. Can’t move my mouth either, only eyes. When I finally do fully wake up after painfully long seconds of feeling like asphyxiating, I’m gasping for air. Sometimes that makes me so exhausted I fall right back to sleep, repeating the process 2-3 times (what’s your highest combo?) before managing to get up. Nasal congestion gets particularly bad randomly when you’re lying down, so I often have trouble falling asleep in the first place, which probably exasperates the SP. You’d figure that something that can keep me up at night would also cause my body to jerk awake immediately, but it doesn’t. So yeah that’s my SP experience 😅",1
My most terrifying dream (???) ever,"My sleep paralysis has always been quite a bit different than many stories I've seen here. Mine are actually dreams of paralysis. Meaning I wake up from them normally, and I don't wake up during the dream. It's almost like I'm having a dream of a sleep paralysis dream. I've probably had 5 or less such episodes. I HAVE had several extended periods of nightly hypnagogic hallucinations, where just as I'm about to fall asleep I here my mom call my name, even when I'm alone in the house. I also once saw a flashing spot of shadow that moved randomly around the ceiling for about a minute after waking up. I should probably note that I have bipolar disorder and mild attention deficit disorder and am on medication for that.

When I was 5 I had an extended period of nightly recurring nightmares of an evil doppelganger of my mother. The official story from my folks and from my childhood psychiatrist, who I have seen for the last 30 years, is that a medication they had me trying out triggered those. However, recently I have, through memory recall meditation and therapy, discovered that the content of the dreams probably stem from an incident I had blocked out, where my mom yelled at me very severely over an extremely trivial matter, and then I had hid under my covers and she cried over it. In my 4 year old mind I had made her mad and had made her cry, and I carried deep feelings of fear and guilt into my adult life without realizing it. There are other traumatic events too, but those aren't really applicable to this particular conversation.

I am currently making huge strides in being free of my addiction to pornography and the marijuana dependency that's grown around it. I also will be seeing a professional psychologist for the first time ever this Saturday. I'm really hopeful I will be able to understand my damages and finally be free to move my life forward. I also have been praying on it a lot, and I have had numerous serendipitous and unexplained events recently than I truly feel were God coming to me to give me the strength to make it through to the other side of this. 

On Tuesday night i had the first ""witch mom"" (what I called her when I was a kid) dream in years. But it was different. It was a sleep paralysis dream, very unlike my childhood dreams. I felt a heavy weight on my chest and then SHE was right there beside my bed and she looked down with this evil as fuck smile on her face, and then she spoke to me...but it wasn't her voice. I don't really remember what the voice sounded like, I just remember what it said: I have 47 names. As soon as she said this I woke up. 

I immediately googled ""47 names"" and what I found was truly disturbing...the 47 names of God from the Torah. I really don't know what to make of this. I've always believed in spirits and ghosts, I actually had an experience in a hospital after a serious car accident years ago. But I've never been sure if I believed in the concept of ""demons"" before. But I've never heard of ""47 names"" before. It almost felt like the message was ""you've been praying for God to come to you again...but tonight I'M here instead."" I could not sleep at all last night. Just like when I was just a frightened little boy back then, I am terrified to fall asleep.

Has anyone had any similar experiences, particularly with seemingly unexplainable things like ""47 names""?",1
i started to experience this recently and im not sure this is SP,"i dont really know if this is considered SP or not but i had two experiences 

one : which happened  last week or so , i opened and i could clearly see my room in front of me 

i was sleeping on my side and i noticed a shade over my shoulder at the corner of my eye and i wanted to roll on my back to see but i couldnt , all of this happened for like seconds 

two : which happened this morning , i woke up from a nightmare ( i was hiding from sth) and opened my eyes and once again i could see the room but i wanted to turn and get out of bed but it was like i couldnt control my body for seconds",1
Did I have sleep paralysis?,"Hi all,   


I know this question is being asked a lot in this subreddit so let me apologize first.

I think I experienced sleep paralysis last night. Went to sleep at 23:00, lay awake in my bed till 00:30 (last time I checked the clock) and fell asleep. Throughout the night I woke up every 2 hours. Happens a lot to me so no biggie. But this time I woke up at 04:00-ish, and I heard an intense vibrating noise in my ears, like I was in a metal factory or something. It was really really loud, not a faint sound. My whole body was also vibrating. I wanted to turn over but noticed that I could not move my body. Throughout all of this I wasn't wide awake but more in a slumber between sleep and wakefulness. I immediately thought to myself:   


*holy fuck I think I am having sleep paralysis!*   


Yeah, never experienced it until now but a mate of mine has it and he always scares the shit out of me with his stories. I meditate a lot (being present with every experience, good or bad, just being with the experience instead of identify with it and getting carried away. Observe the experience instead of identify with it, like a professor observing something through a microscope) so I was able to remain fairly calm and for a second it was an interesting experience! *''Woah, this is actually happening to me! I am aware that I am having sleep paralysis, my body isn't moving but yet I am awake! How peculiar!''* Taking a stance of a professor objectively observing his object of observation through a microscope tends to give me more of a bigger picture view of the situation and makes it less personal.  


I did however closed my eyes as hard as I could, afraid I would see a ghost or something that would have definitely made me freak out and broke my equanimity. I started to try and move my toes and fingers as fast as I could and all of a sudden I snapped out of it and was able to move my body again.  


For all of those who have experienced SP, do you think I just had my first experience of SP?   


All comments are welcome!",1
Reading or watching stories about Demons trigger my SP?,Everytime I read stories or watch a story of demons or entities of that sort before I go to bed I get sleep paralysis.

"Not ""presence""/anxiety/negative emotions related SP: Does anybody else experience this?","Hi, I will try to be quick.  


I had my first SP years ago with pretty much all the symptoms described in the pinned post of the sub, feeling of evil presence, being pushed down, fast heart rate, and of course being aware of your inhability to move.   


I only experienced that kind of SP a couple of times, the one that happens most often is a much more subtle and unharmful, and it is actually the one that bothers me because it can happen a lot of times in a short period of time, with the series of ""events"" being fairly frequently.   


It happens when I'm trying to fall asleep. I would get SP after 5-15 minutes (in REM phase), when I wake up because of a dream or out of nothing. I wouldn't get, however, any of the specific symptoms mentioned in the [pinned post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/f8d1kj/identifying_sp/), just the basic one of being unable to move (and know that you can't move).   


What is interesting and annoying, is that when it does happen, it can easily manifest 4 or 5 times before I finally fall asleep. Like I would get in REM sleep, let's say, 10 minutes, then I would have SP for 20-30 seconds (I don't know the precise time though), then I would fall asleep and the ""cycle"" would repeat itself at least a couple more times. It happens at least once a week. It is worth mentioning that it only (or at least mostly) happens when I'm trying to fall asleep. Does anybody else experience this?",1

This one in particular (although not the freakiest) made me feel awful. 
I can’t sleep facing up like a normal person because as soon as i start feeling pressure on my body I know whats next. 
I usually know when i’m experiencing sp so I know that I need to calm down and focus on my breathing. 

This one morning I saw a person, just a gray colored hologramish silhouette of a woman sitting next to my head. I noticed it because I was trying to get up and something kept holding me by my shoulders. When I saw her I knew it was sleep paralyisis, so as a way to calm me down and realizing it is a dream I decides to touch her arm. When I did this it felt so human, warm. This weird awful feeling came over me, it made me so scared. I had to suck it up and make myself calm down so I could wake up. Just Awful.",1
Music for addressing sleep paralysis,"I don’t know if someone has already said this, but I think listening to music as you fall asleep can help with sleep paralysis. Last night I kept having bouts of sleep paralysis early in the night and once I “woke up”/ moved I put in my AirPods and the paralysis vanished. I hope this helps someone out.",1
Being stabbed in the mouth,"So had a few dreams which turned to sleep paralysis



Was walking w a female friend we were arguing.  Some marines took offense to it


They grabbed me and their commander then slicef a slice lf flesh off mu arm as a punishment.

The commanders face somehow paused for a few seconfs and i could see a old white guy w gray hair. Very creepy


Then i was back inbed sleeping


I felt something approach the sixe of my bed, grab my throat and shove a huge kabar like knife into my mouth 

He began to stRt twisting it


Then after much effort woke up.


Went back to sleep and got paralyzed again but was able to wake.


Never have i ever had such a vivid dream w sleep paralysis


Any input?",1
Was this sleep paralysis,"i just had a nap and had a dream, my dream was ending and i was trying to get to my mum and sister in a car when telling another person i needed to go. as i started to move quickly i turned around and this person was possessed running on all 4s jumped up at me grabbed me, and at this point i felt a very very intense feeling as if i’d been possessed or had energy flying through my body. i then was conscious but wasn’t in my own room, i saw something in the corner of my eye so i slowly opened my eyes and it was my own room and i couldn’t really move i was in shock. i’m so confused as what just happened and my hands couldn’t move for atleast a minute after this. anyone have any ideas?",1
Feeling Dreams and Sleep Paralysis,"Who else suffers from constant sleep paralysis and reality questioning dreams? Share your experiences.

I have a few note worthy ones. The worst episode of sleep paralysis I remember was my first. I remember the a/c unit in the house sounding like an apache helicopter taking off for about 5 minutes. Constant roaring and vibrations in my ears. My heartbeat was so loud. Then random screams mixed with a girl asking. ""Do you remember me now?"", in a soft, echoey voice. Followed by a dark shadow sitting in a corner across the room that made me feel as though it was looking into my very soul. My vision was tunneled. My peripherals were faded to black. Faces, somewhat demonic, randomly appearing in front of me.
Since then I have probably had worst that messed me up, but there have been so many I can't remember them all.

I went months without another episode. Then maybe six weeks. Now, I could possibly have them multiple times a month, week, or night. Never when I wake up. Just while falling asleep.

I usually wake up, either from sleep itself or passing out from exhaustion with someone, most times my mother or another woman, screaming my name. Just one short, stern yell of my name.

The worst dream I ever had that made me question actual reality was followed by a terrible set of episodes of sleep paralysis. I always know when I'm going into the state now, but it doesn't ease anything. The hallucinations and voices are not something to get use to. Anyways. I finally fell asleep after about 30 minutes of constant in and out of paralysis. The dream was me and my wife in the living room. We were just having random, normal conversations. However, I found myself in a seemingly endless, infinite loop. Every time I would ""wake up"", I would find myself still on the couch with my wife in the same spot. After about 4 times I began to get worried. I would be having what had to of been anywhere from 5 to 15 minute conversations before spontaneously waking up into another dream. I remember even finally getting off the couch and going to drink a glass of water, followed by stretching and sitting on the floor, just to make sure I was awake, before again snapping back into another version of the dream.

This went on for literal hours. I know for I remember the last episode of paralysis was about 4 hours or more prior to the first dream. Time felt as it passed the same, and was agonizing to be in an infinite loop for that long. The thing that ended it? A fairly older, white haired woman who I never remember meeting before walked in the house. Spoke to my wife, and stated they were leaving. Her personality seemed very cold and otherwise calm. I asked where they were going. Was told it was none of my business. I asked to tag along. I was told no by the woman as well. At this point I finally believe I am awake, but am somewhat concerned. The woman's demeanor made me believe she intended to cause harm to my wife. That was until my wife and woman leave the house. The door opens. The outside is abstract. I can't move to stop her. I just felt a heavy sorrow seem to take over me and weigh my body down. I finally snap awake. Back on the couch. Frantically run to the room to check on my wife. Took a shower. Then for a few days I was constantly worried whether or not I was still in a dream state. That was weeks ago. Still has me messed up when I think of it. The entire set of dreams looking back at them just seemed like an American Horror Story excerpt. The lighting of the room and odd chill in the conversations. From start to finish I felt constant anxiety and fear, but thought nothing of it.

Let it be known as well that I can physically feel dreams. Not everything exactly, and not every dream. I can feel the breathing. Something touching my skin like the cloth of a couch or cold steel against my arm. I can feel fatigued after running or exercise. I can even feel pain and occasionally smell. As odd as that sounds, I know it makes me seem crazy, but you can only understand as to why I may have been pretty messed up for a few days.",1
Japanese sp demon,"I just woke up paralised and I've felt someone in my room, I was expecting the classic white noise I usually get with sp but then some ghostly figure started speaking japanese. I'm not a fluent speaker and I didn't fully understand him but I love the language and I'm studying it. All I could understand was 殺すぞ (I'll kill you) and 死体 (corpse), his voice was monotone almost lacking any emotion. I've got used to these episodes since I experienced them for a long time, but this was the first time ever with other languages during sp and it was so scary.
Any experience with other languages during sp? Thanks",1
bizarre case,"I'l try to describe what i've been experiencing on a consistent basis and hopefully someone has an idea. Sleep paralysis is typical for me. I used to get all of the crazy stuff during paralysis like visions of entities standing in my room and demonic faces implanted at my wall screaming obscenities at me. At this point i have no fear towards these experiences and i actually find them amusing and funny which is probably why they stopped.

Since mid last year this is what has changed. In the moment i become conscious and start waking out of deep sleep its like an immense pressure starts to build in both my ears and brain. The more i force my self out of this state into regular waking consciousness the worst it gets up until the moment where i become fully awake and at that point it completely vanishes. The sensation is like something, maybe blood, is being built up to the point where it is trying to shoot out of my ears. This happens at leased on a weekly basis and its much more likely to occur when i sleep in.

Anyone got something?",1
My SP experience,"Hello all 😁- just wanted to share my experiences in SP and hear hopefully some of yours. When my SP starts I’m usually asleep/on the verge of sleep but it’s the feeling of being pulled into sleep that gives me the feeling of dread. I hear a loud static noise and there are voices such as people shouting at me and a weird male voice which recurs frequently. The voices are always taunting or negative even if I can’t make out specific words. I feel like I have to jolt or breathe heavily to wake up. I feel trapped and a sense of dread towards falling asleep. Does anyone else on this sub experience similar or the same sleep paralysis as I do and what has helped you overcome this? Would you recommend seeking professional help or any good coping mechanisms/prevention methods. It only comes around once a fortnight but is very intense and terrifying.

Thanks all x",1
It’s a Back Problem,"Hi fellow SP sufferers,

My SP journey started after being diagnosed with Epilepsy when I was sixteen, the dosage and type of medication I was on made me have these vivid nightmares, which led me to not wanting sleep at all but when I did sleep it was always for a few hours. My first SP episode; I could never forget it (I won't detail that because it still scares the living day light out of me). From being newly diagnosed with Epilepsy, Insomnia and being an overall teenager, having SP seemed like the cherry on top, don’t you think?

Though now I have no longer Epilepsy and no longer require medication, 8 years later. I’m still having bouts of SP, not weekly but they still linger.

Now when I’m not scouring the web on reddit forums, I am a researcher during the day. I know the mythology that comes with SP; demons; the old hag, The Pisaderia in Brazilian Folklore. Incubus and Succubus folklore, the Inuit people refer to SP as *uqumangirniq*, Japanase tradition call it *kanashibari*. Not just the culture aspect of things, also medically; I’ve consulted my Neurologist, his explained the whole REM sleep cycle. I’ve done my research on SP.

Yet I haven’t found anyone that suffers something like myself; and yes I’ve aware the all SP sufferers are not the same, we all have individual experiences, but I can’t be the only one right, right?

See, my SP experiences have only happened more during the day than at night; any time I fall asleep accidentally on the couch or take a nap on my bed on the weekend; because of COVID-19 I’ve been working from home a lot lately and times were I just close my eyes and rest turns into a half wrecked-anxiety attack. I never actually fall asleep on my back, I always fall asleep on my stomach, so when I have an SP episode it always feels like someone’s got there hands on my back pushing me down, my eyes are never fully wide awake, there just a tad open.

What I’m seeing during my dreamscape is always a family member; my mum, my dad or my sister (never at the same time). An episode I had a few days ago involved my sister, she’s away at the moment; so there’s no reason for her to be in the house, I fell asleep on the couch and when I “woke” she was just sitting there staring at me, I honestly thought she was back from her holiday. I tried waking up but my body wasn’t doing anything, this is when my anxiety kicked because she just kept staring at me not doing anything as I struggled, I realised what was happening because that feeling of an SP episode, it never leaves. So I calmed myself down, closed my eyes tightly and waited for the weight to be lifted of my back. It did eventually; what was left was a strong headache feeling, my back and neck are always cold after an SP episode and I mean it feels like I’ve been pressed up against ice.

I find these experiences quite harrowing because I guess I’ve always been told that nothing really (paranormal? If that’s what you wanna call it) happens during the day, it’s always at night, that’s why they call it nightmares because they happen during the night.

I’ve reached out to this subreddit because well, maybe I need someone telling me that this, is normal or I need to consult a sleep specialist because sleeping during the day like I’ve been doing…is not normal. Or what I’ve been dreading since I’ve started writing this, is that I need to see a priest.

&#x200B;

Tips or Tricks on how anyone handles SP are greatly appreciated.",1
anyone else have this experience? repetitive sleep paralysis,"recently ive been having a lot more sleep paralysis than i am used to. i know it is probably due to stress but i  usually only experience sleep paralysis once or twice a year (since i was in middle school). since january ive had it at least 20 to 30 times now, some nights back to back, and it is really throwing up my schedule and making me scared to sleep, i am only 17 and do online classes and art commissions during the summer. 

basically it is when i am falling asleep, i experience sleep paralysis and wake up, but oftentimes it feels like it is forcing me to go back to sleep, wake up and experience sleep paralysis again, and go back to sleep, repeating the cycle 4-5 times. this is nothing like the sleep paralysis ive had in previous years. and i havent remembered dreams since i was in elementary, so i dont think it is dreaming either. i only experience tactile hallucinations as well. (also had a case where i felt like i was being splashed with water really hard, super weird but kind of funny. most of it is choking and hitting tho) benadryl can also trigger it.

 i already dont get a lot of sleep bc of migraines keeping me up, so now with me scared to go to sleep bc of paralysis, im not sure how to deal with it. i really just want to know if i am not the only one having this, and if it passes for those who experience these types of symptoms",1
Need a little explanation,Few years back I moved into a foster family’s house and the first night I stayed there I had sleep paralysis. I woke up with a huge sense of dread and couldn’t move. I felt weight at the end of my bed and saw this figure. The door was closed but the light was on outside so I could make out his figure and it had these goat legs and a big hairy head with horns. It was one of the scariest things I’ve ever experienced. As quickly as waking up to this being and being paralyzed I fell right back asleep. Crazy thing is that next morning the foster parents were scared of my because the attic door in there room was open and they thought I did it. Enlighten me in this experiment.,1
My sleep paralysis demon is disguised as my mom,"
So this happened twice so far once a couple months ago and then again a couple hours ago. I’ve had sleep paralysis ever since I was younger. You know when you’re awake but you cant move, some people say they see demons, I know because I’ve seen them too. But lately my sleep paralysis have been different ... scary different. Let me explain 


So the first time I experienced the “scary” difference was a couple months ago. I was sleeping, and all of a sudden Im awake but I cant move and the lights are on in my room (which is weird because when i went to bed they were off) so because I’m used to sleep paralysis I already know not to open my eyes and remain calm, because I’m a scaredy-cat and I know if I see a demon Imma cry. So It stops and I try to go back to sleep but then it happens again. This time I can hear my mom in the living room talking, so I try screaming for her, she comes into the room and walks around my bed but doesnt say anything and I know she couldnt hear me screaming her name because she didnt have a reaction she just came in, so thats when i felt a negative energy coming from the part of the room where she was standing and I knew at that moment that was not my mom. So I close my eyes and she walks away and Again the sleep paralysis leaves but it returned one last time and this time I looked up at the ceiling and all I saw was a black figure with red bright eyes looking directly at me. And I couldnt move, couldnt scream. So i closed my eyes and when I opened them. My room was dark and there was no one in the living room, the house was quiet as a mouse. 


The second time , like I said was a couple hours ago. I was sleeping and all of a sudden I hear music (bachata to be exact) and It was like I was awake but I was sleeping, so I was trying to figure out if it was in my head or if it was real life then I started hearing chatter and it sounded near , like if there was a gathering in my living room and I could make out my aunts voice and shes talking and all of a sudden I hear my mom and I yell for her , but of course she cant hear me because its like I cant make any sound. As she approaches my door I realize its not my mom because shes in Florida getting out of surgery so theres no way shes back in boston so quick. And then what I thought was my mother comes into my room and just stands beside my bed looking down at me and I open my eyes and look straight ahead and from the corner of my eye I see the black figure watching me. And when it leaves my room the noise leaves too and i tried to grab my phone to call for help but When I tried to talk it felt like someone was pushing my throat and I couldn’t talk. And then I woke up.",1
Sp and choking,I woke up early this morning to some sp and choking like i was choking to death.. it took me a min or two to get out of it thankfully..,1
Hearing baby playing,"Okay so I never sleep on my back because I always get sleep paralysis. There’s not a single time I don’t get sleep paralysis if I’m lying on my back while napping. I don’t ever have scary experiences like seeing shadows or anything weird, I just can’t move at all. Well I decided to nap on my back earlier today and I woke up to a baby playing and running around my room, like it was maybe a 1 year old. And I tried to move but couldn’t. I lied there trying to stay calm but then I heard it at the foot of my bed and started freaking out. This probably isn’t that creepy but to me it was startling because it’s never been this way when I have sleep paralysis. Never sleeping on my back again lol.",1
Sleep paralysis dead speak to me,The very first time this happened I heard an older woman speaking Spanish and told me sir can you hear me the minute I responded I fell back asleep but she was so happy that I responded after talking to some people I found out she passed away in the room I was sleeping in the second time I heard a person knocking I believed it was in the front door as I kept saying I'm coming I'm coming I'm trying to get up the man said I hear you I can hear everybody followed by the ticking of a bike being pushed my neighbor said it was a friend who passed away a couple years back said he always pushed around a beat-up bike that ticked a lot when you pushed it. The third time I've heard a loved one who passed away it was my uncle . the first thing he  said to grab my attention was my name after responding the first thing I said was I miss you he said it back has anyone been through something like this before I believe I was speaking in tongues gibberish but clearly I can hear myself in my head,1
EEG induced SP?,"I'm currently being worked up for epilepsy, to try and figure out why I keep having seemingly unexplained seizures.
During my EEG today, I was trying to relax at the end of the test, like the tech asked me to.
I must have fallen asleep because I remember thinking, ""Wake up, its probably time,"" but immediately felt a presence by the foot of my bed, staring at me. I knew it was a black mass without really ""looking"" at him.
Then he spoke.
I didn't bother to listen to what he said because he sounded like a mf evil demon, so I immediately started to fumble over, ""Our Father..."" and by the time I was almost done repeating it mentally, it was over.
I've never had this happen to me before in my entire life, and now I'm terrified to sleep. The only thing I can think that caused this was the stress the lights caused me during the EEG. They use a flickering light with alternating frequencies for about a minute to see how your brain reacts to it.
I've had a splitting migraine ever since.
Thoughts?

Also, when I realized what was happening I tried to open my eyes, or scream, but literally only managed a tiny, TINY whimper. It was terrifying.",1
Did anyone have this feeling before?,"Hey! Last night I had a SP and at the beginning of it I felt a strange sensation in my whole body, as if I'm electrified (if that makes sense). Like a lot of energy gets into my body. Never had this before.

Anyone had the same feeling before?",1
Sleep paralysis?,"I'm not sure if this was sleep paralysis or a dream but I couldn't move, speak, or open my eyes. In the dream I felt like I was lifted up floating on top of my bed and I was aggressively spinning, I felt extremely dizzy. In my dream I could hear chanting ""<my name> wants more"" over and over. Then I saw this demon/witch like figure with a light grey face. Then I woke up extremely dizzy and crying.",1
"Dae ""fall"" into sleep paralysis?","Like, I'll lie down for a nap, feel my body get lighter and then it just locks up and I can't move and I'm stuck. This happens to me as often as waking up paralysed.",1
Melatonin,"Today (well yesterday) I woke up extremely tired but my body didn’t want to take a quick nap. So I decided to take some melatonin. I haven’t taken melatonin in over year, they finally kicked in and I fell asleep. The sp hit me once I fell asleep and it was a cycle of 5 sp. maybe melatonin is the cause for my sp? And taking more causes it to occur often?",1
I’m so scared.,"I don’t know what this was, but i’m truly terrified. I was sleeping last night and it was like an out of body experience. I think i knew i was asleep and i could see my body. it was like i was floating above myself. basically i saw myself in the dark in my room. there was a little girl who tricked me. she told me she lost her parents or she needed me, something of that context. i eventually said yes when she asked me to help her and take care of her. when i said yes her eyes changed and i knew she was a demon. i suddenly knew i was gonna die because i had said yes to this little girl. i don’t know what to do, it may be silly but i’m very paranoid and i’m afraid.",1
It happened 30 times... in one night,"I’ve gotten SP occasionally since I was a teen, but last night was like no other. It honest to god happened 25-30 times. The second i’d close my eyes I became paralyzed. The worst one was when I’d been fine, closed them, then seconds later I was trapped and my head started spinning and swirling, when I broke out I almost threw up I was so dizzy. 

Then throughout the night I’d have crazy dreams, think I had woken up, but was still within the dream. Eventually I could break out and woke up hyperventilating and crying. My fiancé sleeps like a log so after the first couple times of trying to wake him, I just accepted it was going to keep happening. 

The oddest was when I “woke” up 4-5 times but was actually still asleep. That one was so hard to get out of. 

I’m shaking and I have to get ready for work. I hate this.",1
My experiences with sleep paralysis,"Hello everyone.

I wanted to share my three experiences with SP.

The first one wa spretty basic but I was terrified. I laid there not able to move some dark figure was at my feet and I felt it looking at me. I was between 14 and 17 I believe.

The second one was the worst one... I was about 20 21, It was not exactly sleep paralysis because I didn't feel paralysed. I was almost asleep but not yet. I felt something jump unto my bed. By the weight I thought it was my cat... But when I reached to pet him I felt a different type of hair, I started feeling around the round fuzzy figure and felt a human baby face that aggressively jumped and sucked my finger. I remember it very vivedly. I jumped out of bed and turned the lights on revealing an empty room. What was more terrifying was that I don't remember falling asleep or waking up during this whole hallucination. And at the time I had never done psychadelics. 


The third one I was not afraid. I had already done psychadelics and I think I lost the fear of losing control. I was almost sleeping and started floating up. I looked behind and saw myself sleeping. I couldn't move but I was able to speak but every time I opened my mouth I spoke in gibberish and with demonic voices coming out. It was really strange but I just let myself go. I felt a tingle all over my body and started floating outside the window when I was above the house I fell back into my bed in a startle. This one was very recent like 2 years ago. 

Just wanted to share this with you guys.",1
Just woke up from the most terrifying dream,"I was having an actual dream that turned into me laying in my bed. There was what I thought was a man who got in my bed like put his arm around me, then it felt like my ribs were getting squeezed. He got out of my bed and it morfed into a small boy whose face started swelling and scabbing on one side right next to my bed. Then next thing I know it was a small girl about two feet from my bed making the most disturbing growling demonic sound. I tried waking myself up and opened my eyes again and it was still there. Finally actually woke up and it was gone. 
I’ve had hundreds of sleep paralysis or lucid like dreams and this was the most terrifying one. I’m wide awake in bed now. Where I fucked up though is when the man came into my bed I had a negative thought about it and was like this man is not a real man, and then all of that happened. I know it was a sleep paralysis dream because I was stuck, but it felt like a horrible nightmare.",1
Are our eyes really open?,"When we open our eyes during SP are they really open or just a hallucination, i’m asking this because i’ve had times where i’ve been able to move my hands and i’ve touched my phone to turn it on during SP and it didn’t turn on and when I woke up it turned on perfectly by just tapping the screen.",1
I got over it,For past 4-5 years I have been getting sp almost every 2-3 nights. So my sp demon is a huge spider and I am covered in web and feel spiders crawling in my skin. Tbh I am not that scared of spider maybe coz I've had too many encounters with the 9 foot spider on top of me . But now I don't get any sp and I used to sleepwalk when I was young aswell. I don't go for sleepovers anymore coz I sleptwalk once and it ruined my life. If anyone has experienced something similar I would be happy to discuss.,1

Can sleep paralysis be caused by something other than stress etc.?,"This was like 2 months ago and I hadn't had SP for a while (1 year, give or take). I decided to watch a YouTube clip of SP out of nowhere because of my past with it and the same night, it happened again. So I'm just wondering if me watching the SP video made some kind of ""placebo"" effect to my body, or if it was just a coincidence?",1
Had sp for almost 10 years but this is new,"Ive been holding off on posting this for a few weeks to try and process it. So ive had sp for 10 years now. I've found tricks to prevent it from occurring too often. ""Sleeping on my stomach, and if it happens I sleep somewhere else in my house for a night or two, etc"". But anyway my sp was always visual, mainly shadow people. The other week It happened but it wasn't visual at all i heard what I describe as chains dragging on the ground and growling.. i got these dark mental images of a creature thats hard to describe but it wasnt visual. My issue is everything felt so real for the first time in a while.. im unsure of how to deal with this new ""form"" of sp. Any tips on dealing with auditory sp.",1
Ringing in ears,"I’ve been having Sleep Paralysis for 2 years but this is new, whenever I try to focus on something happening in my sleep paralysis my ears get overwhelmed with a ringing sound, for example during my last episode I thought about how i couldn’t move and i tried to move my arm to see if i was strong enough to do it, after a lot of practice i’ve been able to move my wrist to my fingers, but when i tried to move a loud ringing sound happened, has anyone else experienced something similar",1
My story...,"As a young kid I would have sleep paralysis all of the time.  It was disconcerting and extremely scary for me.  I could hear everyone awake around me but I could not move.  I also had to not let myself fall (as in giving in.. I am not sure if this makes sense).  To come out of this I would have to will myself to move with all I could muster.  It would jolt me out of this state.  Again, I hated feeling like this.  I wanted people around me to shake me to be able to move again.  The last time I had this, I was in college.  I felt the same thing, but this time it felt like demons were trying to pull my soul out.  I resisted as much as I could (and I was seriously afraid and worried to the point where I started paying).  I prayed and asked God to please help me to prevent my soul from being taken out of my body.  As soon as I did this, they released me and I shook myself.  I was able to free myself from this.  After this happened, I never had another also paralysis in my life.  25 years have passed and I am ok now.  No more SP.  Really really scary

PS:. I should also mention that I am not religious at all.  I am borderline atheist.",1
weird sleep paralysis,"i experiences sleep paralysis last night but it wasn’t like i’ve heard it was, out of no where i felt an arm wrap around my stomach, and then the bed under me started to vibrate and shake? i couldn’t move at all and it lasted maybe ten seconds",1
Sleep paralysis demon/thing made out with me????,"Idk what my question is or anything but if anyone has had the same experience lemme know/explain why it happened pls? Basically I have had to sleep on my back these past five days due to a damaged nerve, sleeping on my back triggers my sleep paralysis. One of the times from last night I had the SP demon straddling me and then started to make out with me, like, tongue in the mouth etc it was p intense 💀 idk what to make of it, it just looked like a silhouette despite it being bright because it was the morning so I couldn’t see what it actually looked like",1
I broke a VERY simple rule in sp,"The one simple rule, is to NEVER open your eyes.

This morning I was still dreaming and I knew I was sleeping 

Then the sleep paralysis hits me and it feels like gravity just increased.

My eyes were closed, but I knew the was probably something there.

So I opened my eyes.

I saw a woman like figure on my bed with no eyes.


I was scared, but also angry, so my plan was to lift up my arm, and punch her.

It failed obviously,

My legs started to work so my plan was to move my body off my bed and onto the floor. In the hopes that someone would hear me hit the ground

It also failed, but that was because I got out of it first.",1
I call it the screamer,"Does anyone ever expedite this? I moved into a beautiful townhome and before had never had SP but since living there in January I’ve had about 5 occurrences. Can happen at any time of the day - once is was a nap, once it was early evening, etc. I have seen it take the shape of my boyfriend once in a reflection in the French door glass we have in our room, but the most terrifying thing is that is sounds like a metallic buzzing that grows so loud it trembles my body. Sometimes I’m able to try and regain speech, other times not. And the episodes always happen 6 times. I keep falling back into it. Has anyone experience this?",1
Being able to move during sleep paralysis,"I’ve had sleep paralysis once in my life. It was terrifying, but it was unusual. I was sleeping on one side with my eyes open, and then I hear a shuffle ( it was the sheets on my bed) behind me. I paid attention to the sound and a few seconds later I felt the weight of someone or something crawling unto my bed from the floor. It kept crawling behind me this is when I realized I could actually move. I moved my right arm closer to my chest, I also rolled a bit more away from whatever was crawling towards me. Being able to move made me rule out sleep paralysis which made it worse, with that logic there could be an actual person behind me. I thought if there is a crazy person behind me there is a chance I’ll die, but I might as well die sleeping. By that time the creature was right behind me, I could hear and feel it breathing next to my head. (By this time I had closed my eyes) And suddenly it grabs my shoulder and it screeches in my ear. After a few seconds it stops and crawls back, the whole time I could move I just didn’t dare to see what was behind me. My ear hurt for a couple days after the event.

Edit: English isn’t my first language I hope you are able to understand.",1
Does anyone else get SP and it's no big deal?,I don't want to jinx it but I have never seen anything while having SP. I've had it well over 100 times. The first few times it was scary because I didn't know what was happening. Now it's pretty much a non-event. I typically just roll back over and fall back asleep. Does anyone experience SP in this fashion? Ok now off to knock on wood...,1
Was This Just SP or Something Else?,"As I was taking my power nap before I go to work, I experienced a different kind of SP.
First it was just your normal SP, then I started seeing people's faces, I dont even know who they are and I opened my eyes, my vision is similar when water is continously running down a glass, then I heard a womans voice she said "" You will remember my name again and live forever and ever. Dont forget"".

I tried to remember the exact phrase she said but thats all I can remember because her voice went softer and SP is fading too.",1
Is it normal to not be able to open your eyes in paralysis,"I have had dozens of sp episodes but I almost never see shadows but always have auditory hallucinations and can't open my eyes. When I do my eyelids just flicker like butterfly wings to open for a second to scan the room. So while it sounds like I'm in a field of horses or industrial factory, it takes a lot of force just to see the room is as normal as ever",1
It wasnt a shadow person this time,"Ive experienced sleep paralysis for years now, but this time I saw something different. Recently there had been a shooting within my dorm, an indvidual who lived a few doors down from me shot his girlfriend and himself. When the sp started, it was business as usual until I looked and didnt see the usual shadow figure. It was the bastard who shot up my hallway, clear as day in a dark room. He leaned in close so I could see his face, menacingly said wassup (my nickname) then laughed before disappearing. Ive never seen something like it during an sp situation, nor have I had auditory hallucinations prior to this. 

Does anyone have any knowledge on connections between sleep paralysis and paranormal happenings?",1
I’m scared and can someone help me identify this,"I have never practiced lucid dreaming before but have been in a stressful environment (moving, job change, etc.) for about two weeks now. I can’t tell if this is sleep paralysis instead- when you are all saying “I opened my eyes” do you mean in your dream or in real life? 

Basically I have taken two naps and accidentally become lucid. In this dream today I was in a room and all of the people around me were speaking Spanish and ignoring me (I don’t speak any Spanish). I thought to myself “wow... they are going to tell me I died.” I was so scared- I knew I was dreaming and spent the entire dream hitting and punching myself, clapping, screaming for my partner to wake me up and trying to force myself back into my body. It took so long- I wound up napping for three hours. This shit really freaks me out- can any one help me figure out what’s going on?",1
Was this sleep paralysis,"Today I took a nap. I planned on actually sleeping but it turned into a nap, when I started to fall asleep I started hearing really distorted voices that werent mine, but they were still my thoughts. Then distorted sounds, after I fell asleep and I woke up 2 hours after I heard two voices in my head talking at the same time about the same thing. Then I tried to think about 2 different things and it worked but I couldnt like undertand them. Then however, It felt like I was crossing my eyes but SUPER intense, and I saw this flashing square with a square in each corner, all changing colors, I couldnt breath or move and I thought I was seizing, was this sleep paralysis?",1

Is there such a thing of Sleep Paralysis without ‘demons’? (Thinking I’m awake when I’m not),"Is there such a thing of Sleep Paralysis without the demons etc? I think I experience sleep paralysis quite a lot but I didn’t know what it was, there’s never any demons or scary things like that instead I’m usually unable to speak and panicking about that. Last night I experienced what I believe was sleep paralysis it was so frightening that I had to google “realistic dream where you can’t speak” and I found the term ‘sleep paralysis’ then found this reddit.. I’m not trying to self diagnose myself or anything but what do you think this is? -

I often struggle to sleep and last time I was struggling even more than normal. I was awake at 6am still in bed with my cat and partner. I fell to ’sleep’ and I was kinda like dreaming that I hadn’t? I still thought I was trying to get to sleep. Everything was exactly the same. So I was still in bed and I heard my partner say what are you doing? And I replied just laying here, I can’t sleep, I think we spoke a tiny bit more then I leaned up slightly. Suddenly I fell back onto my back and my ears were ringing my vision was going blurry and fading to black and I couldn’t speak but I was desperately trying to scream or shout. I thought I was having a stroke or something and I was fighting to stay alive, I could see my partner like scramble around to get her phone (I assume to ring the ambulance). I seemed to wake up after that and I was 100% convinced that what happened was real life, I had to wake up my partner ask her if we just had a conversation and she said no, I asked her about 3 times convinced otherwise. I was so shook by what had happened i didn’t go back to sleep.

So do you guys think this is a form of sleep paralysis? As I’ve read a lot on here about seeing objects and demons but my dream felt more scary in a ‘realistic way’ if that makes sense?.. thanks!",1
Looking for people who get sleep paralysis VERY frequently,"I'm looking for any individuals who experience sleep paralysis very frequently. 

Anyone here get it every day? 

I'm interested in hearing your experience with it and how it affects your life. 

How do you think your life would be different if you didn't have sleep paralysis?",1
Was this dream SP or something else you know of?,"I was tired from sleep loss and fell asleep in the middle of the day. I dreamed a normal dream until it suddenly turned into a nightmare I’ve never experienced before. I was laying down on a bed in a room, so my mind felt like it was real. When I looked up 3 people were staring at me with dark eyes. One was my brother, although looking back he didn’t really look like himself. In his hand he had a tv controller, which he aimed at me like a gun. As we all know tv controllers are deadly so I was super scared. He and the other 3 people had dark scary voices telling me things. Things like “You wouldn’t want to get hurt, would you?”, even though I have no idea what they wanted me to do. 

As this is happening I’m suddenly behind a car outside the same house that I’ve never been to. I have almost no clothes on - I’m wearing what I went to sleep with. I see some people near so I hurry to take on a hoodie laying on the ground. It’s night of course and as I’m about to close the back of the car by reaching up to the button, when all my vision disappears and a guy holds me down on the ground. He and a girl beside whispers things I don’t understand. I think he’s about to rape me.

Then I’m back in the room again, my “brother” now holding the tv controller in a more reasonable way - as something to hit me with(even tho it’s still a weird choice of weapon lol). Now I’m already super terrified so I just want to wake up (I’ve been feeling it’s a dream for awhile). But as soon as I see the light from my real room my eyelids shut and I’m back in the room. This happens lots of times over a short period - I fight my eyes open so I can see a glimpse of light and they shut. I try to scream in real life for my mom to come and wake me, but no sounds come. The next time in the room I’m just about to get hit, and I protect myself with my hands. But nothing comes and then I wake up.

It’s probably not SP since I wasn’t in my real room but in an imaginary, but do you guys know anything about being unable to wake up or the shifting from reality to dream multiple times? I just felt it wasn’t like any nightmare I’ve ever had. Once I went up from my bed I felt like I wasn’t sure it was real, and that maybe the demons and my brother might just be messing with me. I didn’t know if I could speak so it took awhile before I dared to talk to anyone. Thanks for reading :)",1
I’m scared this has happened twice now,"New to reddit so sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit.
I am 33 yrs old and just recently had a baby I’ve had some crazy things happen in my life but nothing as crazy as this.theres been 10 months between these two experiences and I’ve moved and everything but when I’ve gone to bed I’ve woke up to something grabbing my hand and trying to pull me out of bed and I’ve had electricity going through my body both times the first time I was seeing red and heard screaming the second time was last night. I couldn’t move but also felt like I was fighting for my life this second time felt stronger I was screaming in my head and fighting I heard a male voice say “you’re not going to win” it happened longer too. I’m extremely scared and am scared for my little one because both times my arm that was being yanked was holding my little one. Please help anything will help anymore I don’t want this happening again",1
A good SP experience,"I use to have sleep paralysis pretty frequently. Like 1-2 times a week at least. I guess it's been about 5 years since my last episode though, and I'm not really sure why it doesn't happen anymore. I remember in the beginning it would scare the crap out of me. I would hear people in the room with me, talking to me or to each other. One time I heard 2 people talking in a language I couldn't understand, but I felt the message was important and I should pay attention. I've felt a dog lick my fingers (no dog in the house). I've heard my name being called in a very sinister kind of way. I had no idea what was happening, and when I told people, they just looked at me like I was crazy. Nobody seemed to know what the hell I was talking about. So I got online and googled my symptoms and started reading about sleep paralysis and all the weird things that happen to people during an episode... I mean, it was my experience to a T, except I dont recall feeling an entity on top of my chest like so many others did. Anyway, in the process of discovering what was actually happening to me, I also discovered astral projection, which I had never even heard of at the time.. I read about how people were turning their sleep paralysis into out of body experiences, and I was so intrigued, I decided to give it a go since my SP was really a pretty negative experience at that time. It was a game changer honestly. Anytime I felt the vibrations coming on and heard the roaring in my ears, I started to focus on separating my spirit from my body. Sometimes it was easy, sometimes not so easy. You know the force it takes just to move your fingers during SP? I put that same effort into rising up out of my body, or sometimes I would spin around backwards and come out that way. One time I reached for the bars on my daybed and grabbed them (in spirit) and pulled myself up and out of my body and then floated to the ceiling (I didn't know how to get past that point at the time). The last few times I have had SP, I have focused on leaving my body, and I've been successful. But like I said, I have not had SP in a very long time, and I am not sure why. I would love to experience it again, but I am not sure what I can do to make that happen? When it was bad, I was drinking a lot and sometimes using drugs that kept me up for days... I have been clean and sober now for about 6 years so I dont know if that has any relation but maybe? And to all the people who are scared shitless of SP,  please know that it doesn't have to be a bad experience. Just like a bad dream, once you realize you are dreaming, it becomes a lucid dream which is yours to control. If anybody can relate to anything I've said here, or if you have any insight into how to bring on SP, please feel free to comment! Thank you",1
Sleep paralysis Awake,"Lots of people say that’s you’re asleep when you have SP, but how come I can have my eyes open and I can’t move my hand but after 10 seconds, without closing my eyes, I can move my body again and it’s like I was never asleep.",1
Sleep tremors/paralysis?,"This is pretty confusing, and quite weird and has been going on for a year. Maybe more. Many times during sleep or before waking up, my body has really intense vibrations. Sometimes they’re not bad, but quite frequently they have been really difficult to deal with. They’re not “painful”, but they’re very... uncomfortable? It’s a mix between the two, it’s the best way I can describe it. The past month I’ve noticed they always happen when I take a nap during the day. I’ll nap for about an hour and all of a sudden bam. I start shaking. My body starts vibrating really “hard”, mainly my arms and torso, rarely in my feet. During this time I am unable to move anywhere except my head, and the only way I’m able to break out of these tremors is if I move my head which basically breaks my body out of the tremors. The thing is, it’s very difficult. Like it’s physically hard to tilt my head to the side and sometimes it’s hard to the point where my head literally snaps back into place where it was. It usually takes three tries but after my head is free then I can get up and move around again. What’s also hard about this is my body’s really tired so I have a hard time getting up. Also,  when my head is free I still have this tingly feeling over my body which basically means my body hasn’t fully left the state of “vibrations” and can easily fall back into it if I don’t get up immediately. It’s happened many times. I honestly have no idea how this is still in my body but I haven’t contacted a doctor about this yet. I’ve been thinking about seeing a doctor about this for a while but never got around to it for some reason. But before I do I just wanna see what y’all guys think about this and perhaps what y’all think is going on. Also I hope this is on topic with sleep paralysis, mainly because I can’t move in this situation and it’s possibly related. Also to add, I’m unable to talk. I’m frightened during the paralysis/tremors that the best I can do is a scream/moan for help which no one has ever heard.",1
What the actual hell?,"Okay guys, so yesterday something really weird happened. I was just sleeping in my bed when all a sudden my eyes open and I can barely move a single muscle. suddenly, this THING some shadow thing crawls over my body!!! I was horrified, I even remember not being able to scream for help... I didn't know what the hell happened and I tried searching for what happened. It looks like I have ""Sleep paralysis"" a mental illness (I think) that makes victims have illusions or something???? Nonetheless, I AM ABSOLUTELY DISTURBED. can anybody help?",1
Sound Block,"I have actually never had a conversation with someone about this, but it’s happened more than once. I am really fuckin tired and was trying to nap but strange shit started happening. I played a 13 minute long ASMR video and closed my eyes, looked a my cat sleeping next to me, cuddled him and was set. Next thing you know I feel weight on me (sleeping to the side), I can’t physically wake up or even open my eyes or speak aloud. But I still feel like I’m in my room. I struggled for a bit, a little panicky, but I remembered that last time this happened I tried yelling “NO!” in my head which allowed me to say it aloud but came out whispered even though I tried yelling (weird I know, but it actually worked and I’ve never gotten out of that trance unless I wait it out and struggle in fear 😭). I tried it for a bit because I couldn’t completely wake up cause I’m a lazy bitch and was hoping it would stop soon and I WOULD BE ABLE TO SLEEP. But each time I closed my eyes I felt as if I was LITERALLY being dragged from my legs off of my bed or grabbed by my arms and being pulled down.  And at some point it seemed like my eyes opened and I saw my cat, but the lighting was different with a flashing orangish light. But when I finally turn my lights back on so I can keep my eyes open, and stop allowing myself to experience this so many times :/. I expected to have, at least, napped  five to ten minutes, but I look at my phone and it’s about 22. The ASMR video is COMPLETELY over and I didn’t hear a bit of it and woke up around 8 minutes after the video. Funky shit bro. I hate it",1
We all woke up at the same time,"I believe that this simulation is breaking. I've have premonitions of our future in the simulation as well as my true self and it actually sounds crazy. It's like a parallel world, but it is the real one. Not everyone is in here with us. And not all of us are real here. I'm not sure if I should tell my premonition dream I had. It sounds crazy, but feels all to real. I just know in this simulation that the ones holding us here are making certain ones that fight them to actually suffer for revolting and fighting against them. I should know soon, once the simulation breaks.

I'd love to know your theory. I know there are 283 of us from my group trapped here. I am sure I have found two of us besides me. One I've told who believes we are in a simulation. We made a pack that whoever wakes up first will find the other. The other one wouldn't believe me even if I told them. But I'm 100% serious. Thoughts?

Edit: I was asked for more details and here is my comment.

[[[I'm honestly not sure about why 283. I just know that was the group of people in our fighting group. I was last of five in the group, as well as the leader.

I've had many premonition dreams recently. Though one is happening now that has to do with our government here trying to control us lesser people.

The other one is use being secluded in our homes, (please note this was before the virus outbreak) and being required to be home locked up. The homes are ruined down and limited to certain amount of use for electricity and electronics. Every home has a single TV installed in each house. And when a news report from the government comes on an alarm siren outside comes on for all to watch the show.

There was a red screen with a warning text scrolling up and a black and what video comes on with that blue color text at the bottom saying stuff but I can't make it out as I'm super focused on the movie.

The movie starts out with scientists at NASA working. I say to my mother ""This isn't the one with the baby chip in the space suit?"". Then it proceeded with seeing the mother and father chimps being worked on. Then the video pans up to see the baby chimp in the space suit that the scientists were sending to space due to the end of the world. Then it fades to black and I wake up.

Then the recent premonition dream I had recently was a five part one. Quite literally. The first part was that me and one of the five remaining team members of the 283 members were in a store which was a Walmart.

Let me move back with how this world and our simulation world are alike. Our simulation has the same things in its would as it is in the real world. Like said Walmart.

In the real world our would is under the control of some bad bad people, who are worse then here in the simulation. As they have complete control of the world.

They send people to this simulated world for various reasons. Some just for creating data, some to run and keep this world in order. Though the 283 members of the revolting members are sent here once captured are sent here and punished with pain, suffering, poorness, horrible things, etc. Not everyone who is going through this is a member, and not everyone here are even real. Some are NPCs.

Now this premonition is what happened before I got here. But it is my memory leaking through now.

Now back to me and the other girl at Walmart. We were there hiding out and trying to stay safe. We were heading out as we knew they were onto us. So we were heading out the right side if the store when we saw the guys down on the left side running upon us and some from the other side and back. We ran out of the store as black vans pulled up to capture us.

Note: In the real world magic and spirit animals actually exist.

As we were leaving my spirit animal, being a dire wolf came and I hoped on, and my friend has some sort of feline. We got on and made our way to a trust source. But the people were right on us.

We were on our phones to keep contact with the leader who we called ""boss"" as the codename. We had found out we were the last two left.

We made it to the contacts and hid in a large van. But they knew we were there. They surrounded us and came up to the van and as I told the ""boss"" ...""boss they found us...they got us""... they knocked us out and I felt I was entered into this world.

After I woke it was like my memory was coming back and cleared. J thought a bit about how real it was. It made sense. I then dreamed 4 more times of me contacting (more like trying to contact) my other 4 team members to try to help them wake up. But each time I was cut off.

Note: I believe that our spirit animals actually end up inserted here as well. Mine was 15.5 year old dog who was a soul bonded dog that called out to me that I had 14.5 years. I lost him in 2018 when shit really started to go crazy.

Like I said these things are crazy and I didn't go into detail on the first one listed.]]]

Okay so far during my research with others there are two things that all have had in common.

(1. Everyone during discussion of the simulation theory gain a horrible headache that can lead to a migraine. Our theory so far is that the people in charge of the simulation are trying to discourage and block us from discussing it.

(2. Each one I have talked with so far have shared them being in a white medical like room with scientists around. Most say ""s/he is waking up"" or ""s/he is fighting back"". Then most report a gray fog that ends up making them go to sleep. Then they wake up back in the simulation.

First let me say you have to be asleep to wake up in the real world. Then there you will wake up in the real world, but you either won't be able to move or fight due to weakness. And normally we are hooked up to something that has us hooked into this world we are in. The gray fog is something to put us back to sleep there and to make us return to here.

I know ones in real life who's had this happen and ones online. Those ones online have either posted in a post or DMed me. I don't ask them about it. But I wonder how many this has happened to.

I will still continue to live this life as we need to, as death is not the answer. And I will fight for more answers.

A bonus thing is the glitches. As the simulation is a bit wonky now. I as well believe the simulation is breaking.",1
Have you tried controlling what you see during sleep paralysis?,"I’ve just had this thought now, I can sometimes control my dreams so I was thinking maybe if we can control our dreams. theoretically one should be able to control what they see during SP since you’re still on the spectrum of REM. 

If anyone tries this or has already done it report back to me. 

Thanks",1
SP every morning when wanting to go back to sleep.,"Personally to me this is the most frustrating thing. Because I will seemingly wake-up at almost the same time every morning, around 10am. However since SP isn't my only issue, I also suffer from quite intense dreams or nightmares every night, I usually wake up exhausted and still super tired. Yet when I go back to sleep, it triggers an SP episode? Why does this trigger in such a specific way? Does anyone else get this?",1
Anyone else have this?,"Okay so I've had my fair share of sleep paralysis episodes, but they still freak me out.  Lately though, I haven't been having normal sleep paralysis.  I've been having *dreams* that I'm having sleep paralysis and when I come out of it, I'm still asleep.  Sometimes I'll wake up and be having a normal sleep paralysis episode as well.  Kind of on the same note, I have a lot of dreams within my dreams too, it's trippy.  I've never seen inception but I feel like maybe I should watch it lol.  Sometimes I realize I am dreaming and I will try and wake up during these episodes, but I can't.  This honestly freaks me out more than my regular sleep paralysis spells.  It's scary when you're sleeping and you try and wake up and physically can't... and I always feel weird after I wake up and really freaked out.  Anyone else experience this or know anything about this kind of sleep paralysis?",1
A brief description of a “Hat Man” encounter,"As the title suggests, I’m going to describe an experience I had with the so-called “Hat Man”. All discussion and opinions welcome. 

I’d like to begin by making a few qualifying statements regarding my beliefs in “the supernatural”. I do not consider myself a person who “believes” in ghosts, demons, or monsters, though a childlike part of me would certainly love to live in a world where these things exist. On any given day, I may be more open to the possibility that such things are probable or likely - it all depends on what I’ve been consuming lately. If I’ve been watching Neil D Tyson YouTube videos all day, I’m unlikely to give much weight to such things. If I’ve been down a Wikipedia occult rabbit hole, on the other hand, my opinions may shift.

Ok. Anyway. The story. 

I’ve always had sleep paralysis. I don’t remember when it started, but it’s been going on for years. Sometimes it will happen 3 nights in a week, several weeks in a row, sometimes I won’t have an incident for months or years. It’s been happening since childhood.

I was living in a house with some friends. It was a bi-level, my room was downstairs. There was a “mud room” at the back of the downstairs hallway that led outside, with an old workbench and tools in it, belonging to a previous (we assume) tenant. 

One night, I had a sleep paralysis attack. It was the most severe I ever had. I heard what sounded like distorted, warbling screams very loudly in my ears, as well as a deep distorted voice talking in an unknown language or making unrecognizable linguistic sounds. 
I couldn’t move, as is common. I felt the overwhelming terror and fear, as well as “the presence”. 

I could only look toward the door, as I happened to be facing it. I saw what appeared to be a humanoid shape in silhouette, wearing a wide brimmed hat. The shape was not all black, but rather, it was mottled and shifting - like when you press really hard on your eyes and get purple after images. 

It “moved” in the sense that it slid sideways into the room and remained by the door, but it’s limbs always remained static. Picture a cardboard cutout being slid sideways. The sounds, which I can only describe as “hellish”, intensified, as did the fear and the sense of danger. It remained there briefly, then slid back out. The episode faded, and sounds returned to normal. 

Now. A few interesting facts surrounding this:

- I had never heard of the hat man before, and did not know anyone else had similar experiences until YEARS later when I watched a documentary called ‘The Nightmare’. Imagine what a mindfuck that was for me, listening to other people describe this very same, or similar, vision.

- Other people who came to the house mentioned feeling uneasy around the mud room. One friend, who had never been to my house, and had no relationships with either the people that lived there with me, or friendships associated, called me out of the blue one night to tell me they just had a very disturbing lucid dream about me living in a house with a haunted basement room that was “dangerous”. This person had no motivation to lie, and to receive a call like this from them was very out of character for them. I can’t recall if this was before or after the paralysis episode.

- one of our roommates had a dog when we first moved in, and would let it roam free in that hallway when they were at work. It was a very friendly animal. Over the course of two months it became what I can only describe as “feral” and dangerous, to a degree that even its owner could no longer approach it for fear of being attacked. We had to have it removed and the owner “got rid of it”. (I don’t know what he did with the dog, if it was adopted or put in a shelter. I may have been told at the time, but I can no longer remember.)

- researching Hat Man, it is described as being associated with BASEMENTS and “negative feelings in a household”. I had a room below ground, and was experiencing a severe “Cold War” with two other roommates during this time period I experienced the paralysis episode. 

So there it is. Very, very strange. I have no other stories about experiencing anything remotely supernatural, beyond other episodes of sleep paralysis, though none produced visual hallucinations like this. I offer this information without a leading definite conclusion about what took place. These are presented simply as facts about “a thing that happened”.

More disturbing than the incident itself, is the events surrounding it which would corroborate some kind of “supernatural” experience. Again, I offer no final conclusion in that regard.

Thoughts? Anyone?",1
The kiss,"Earlier this morning I felt someone on my bed next to me give me a deep kiss, and when she broke the kiss she said you're mine in a high whispery voice. I haven't been able to go back to sleep because I've been really creeped out by this.",1
Is this sleep paralysis?,"One night around 2am I thought I heard a dog barking so I woke up it was still barking. The kind of bark that sounded as if it was being tortured. Whimpering and crying etc.. I woke up but I could move to check only my head could move. 

The dog stopped barking and that’s when I started to see flashes, the kind of flashes you see behind a curtain when it’s thundering and lightning. My blinds were all the way down but I could see the light flashes through the top and the bottom of the blinds. 

There was buzzing sound too like a giant wasp and whenever it got close to my bedroom door it would be really loud and flash it would move around the outside of my bedroom (note: none of this was inside my room all outside) it would be buzzing and flashing all around the outside of my room (another note: my bedroom is a small guest house out in the garden) it was decent weather no storms just average. 

I tried to move but I couldn’t and my breath was getting heavier and it was way more difficult to breath so I just held it. This seemed to go on for hours and hours but it was realistically only minutes. 

I woke up the next day in fear to move.",1
I think my dog saved me from sleep paralysis last night,"I’ve had two experiences with sleep paralysis in my life. Both happened about 5-6 years ago, and then it never happened again. I think it hasn’t happened again because I learned how to tell when it’s about to happen and I force myself to wake up, get out of bed, and kind of “reset” myself, if that makes sense. 

Anyways, last night, I was having a very fitful sleep. Hot, cold, tossing and turning, having weird and scary dreams, stuck in that state halfway between sleep and awake, which is the state when it’s happened the two times before. 

In the middle of the night, my 6 month old pitbull starts barking and growling out of nowhere. I can say with 100% confidence she’s never done this before. She’s never even truly growled at anything before (except when she gets riled up playing tug, but this was a very different growl). 

It woke me up and scared me, so I got out of bed to figure out what was causing her to freak out and I couldn’t find anything. So I calmed her down, she went back to sleep and so did I. I slept perfectly fine the rest of the night. 

It’s been bugging me all day today and I’ve been trying to figure out what she could have been growling at, because I know it wasn’t nothing. 

Then it dawned on me... I think my dog saved me from sleep paralysis. I don’t know how she knew but I’m so grateful.",1
I went through the list of symptoms pinned and my recent dreams don't really line up. Sorry to be that guy but is this SP?,"I've had a recurring set of dreams lately but they don't align with the standard symptoms for most people, or the list that's pinned at the top of this subreddit. Pretty much what happens is I wake up in the same place I fell asleep in under the same circumstances I fell asleep in. For example, today my girlfriend is at work right now and in the dreams she came back from work.

The issue is that I don't have the common symptoms that I've read about. I don't wake consciously and be unable to move. I'm not panicking, nor have I opened my eyes and kept dreaming (as far as I know). I don't feel a pressure placed on my chest, I don't see or feel a scary presence, nor do I have nightmares before or after (or ever really). The only symptom I can think of is that I feel heavy/stiff, and occasionally speaking is hard. Edit: I forgot to mention that the harder I try moving, the less I can.

All it is is a cycle of dreams where I wake up where I fell asleep and everything seems normal (like my gf getting home) but when I start moving around or doing stuff, weird things (not scary) happen that tell me it's a dream. So I try to wake up from that and I finally do it's normal again but then more weird things happen. This cycle of waking up to still being in a dream happens probably 5 to 8 times before I actually wake up. I'm certainly weighted down or stiff, but never unable to move entirely or unable to breath. Is this SP?",1
Only in the light,"Why do I only have episodes of sleep paralysis, when there's enough light in the room to make out the furniture? I typically sleep in as close to total darkness as I can. I've noticed that I only have episodes when there's a substantial amount of light in the room, from my door being open or it being the middle of the day and the light coming through my dark curtains just enough.",1
Sleep paralysis?,So this happens a lot especially when I’m very exhausted I lay in bed and right when I drift off I get paralyzed for like 3 seconds and jolt back awake and heart racing. Especially i noticed when I lay on my back and there has been times it’s lasted for 10 seconds and I’ve experienced sleep paralysis fully before but it doesn’t seem to be that but not sure anybody know what it could be ?,1
Portal 2 crying core woman,"So I woke up on my side after waking up at 4AM and going back to sleep on my back (my biggest mistake, lol) at around 4:30am and I had my eyes closed when I woke up, but i was still paralyzed. My air conditioner slowly turned into sniffling sounds, and I was having visions of a portal 2-esk test chamber. There was the same little hookup thing that Glados and Wheatley hooked up on to control the facility, it felt huge. The minute I walked up to it. It was one of the cores from portal, but it had a very unsaturated pink eyeball. When I pulled it out, it started SOBBING. just a woman. No robot voice to her. Literally sobbing. Sorry if this doesn’t make sense as I am SO exhausted from being stuck awake after this experience 😂",1
How would you depict Sleep Paralysis in a film?,"I’ve never experienced Sleep Paralysis (that I remember at least, I feel like I may have experienced it auditory when I was younger) but I’ve been obsessively intrigued with it since I heard about it. I even have a guilty desire to experience a terrible sleep paralysis (knowing full well that I would be terrified).

Another thing —probably one of the biggest things— I am interested in is film, I want to be a filmmaker. So I got to thinking how I would depict Sleep Paralysis on film based on accounts from those who experienced it and I’ve got quite a few good ideas in my opinion.

But I want to ask, how would you depict Sleep Paralysis in film? And are there any good depictions of it that already exist in movies (or bad)?

In contrast if you want you could say what you would 100% not want in a depiction.",1
I made a connection with green?,I don’t know what it is but this morning  I woke up then shut my eyes for a short period and in my head multiple choices showed up I can’t remember the other ones only the one I chose which was make a connection with green I then immediately had my first ever experience with sleep paralysis but it wasn’t bad I couldn’t move at all but I moved a hand I’ve never moved before and I saw beautiful vibrant colours that I’ve never see before for a split second it also felt like I was falling at an extreme speed as my body was under a constant pressure and my ears were doing that thing were wind goes past and ur earwax makes a weird noise when u ride a bike I’m just confused what a connection with green means and I asked my sister and dad who have suffered from sleep paralysis and they don’t know,1
Can you hear voices during sleep paralysis?,"I looked it up online and apparently most people hear muffled whispering or barely audible or meaningless noises, like tapping or whatever. I have never experienced sleep paralysis before, but I experienced it tonight I believe. During my experience I heard clearly audible enunciated stuff. I woke up from a dream, and I heard a voice outside of my head that was very low pitched saying ""HA HA HA!"" I have never experienced this before so I was SHOOK. I am religious so I tried to call upon Jesus' name to get rid of it, but I couldn't speak, my throat was like paralysed (hence why I assume sleep paralysis), but very quickly I was able to move and I basically told it to get lost in Jesus' name and it did. Then I started to go back to sleep again and I heard a pig squeal externally. I was shook again and this time freaked out about sleeping. It was like ""SQUEE!"" 😂 It was super scary because I've never experienced it before. Can somebody explain to me about auditory hallucinations and if this sounds like them, and if this is sleep paralysis? I think it is, but I am wondering why most people hear very subtle voices and I heard really specific ones? I also didn't hallucinate anything, I just heard stuff.",1
Shaking due to fear in SP,Every time I get frightened by the things I see my head shakes intensely. It’s just a motion of left and right but really really fast and with my body feeling like it’s vibrating as hard as it can.,1
Eyes Closed Sleep Paralysis,"I’m pretty sure I’ve had sleep paralysis, but I’m a little confused bc in everything I’ve heard, people usually have their eyes open and hallucinate. 
My eyes were closed, and I tried to open them but it felt like someone was holding them closed, I also heard someone banging on my door and screaming to let them in but my roommate says there was never anyone there. I had no idea it wasn’t real and I was freaking out because my body wasn’t moving and I couldn’t see anything and I thought someone was trying to break in and I wouldn’t be able to defend myself. 

Is there a way to prevent this from happening again? I have no idea what triggered it. Was this really sleep paralysis, and if it was, is it unusual that I couldn’t open my eyes?",1
Sleep paralysis every day and multiple times in a row each time. Someone help,"For a few years now, I have been experiencing sleep paralysis semi-frequently. Recently though I have seen it start to happen every day at around anytime from 6 am-12 pm. The problem is my sleep paralysis isn't something that happens once and is over, I have multiple in one day and in rows. I don't know the best way to explain it but let's just say it's in cycles. I sleep, then I get sleep paralysis, I break free from it, and IMMEDIATELY get it again. This cycle usually goes on for about 6-10 times until it just stops naturally or until I force myself awake. This makes me exhausted in the mornings because technically I'm not sleeping.

Is there anyone that knows the causes or how I can stop this problem. Anyone that is experiencing the same things?",1
"how do i induce sleep paralysis, do i need to have my eyes closed or open when staying still","i want to induce paralysis to see wat its like, a bunch of youtubers are saying stay still tried it. it kinda works, but they dont explain if your eyes need to be open or not which is it",1
Sensory hallucinations during sleep paralysis,"Hello!

I am aware that you can experience sensory hallucinations, such as pressure in your chest etc during sleep paralysis. But in my case, most of my sleep paralysis experiences are sensory and audible hallucinations, and some of them are creepy as hell. Here's the few creepiest ones i've gone through.

1. Giggling children under my bed

So I was jolted awake by the sensation of someone rocking my bed from underneath it (lifting it with their feet, hands etc.) I heard two clear voices giggling and laughing underneath my bed, and it felt like it was two kids doing it. They seemed playful but at the same time kind of menacing - they definitely wanted to mess with me.

2. Blowing in my ear

I have this weird thing that i can't fall asleep unless my up facing ear (i sleep on my side) is covered by my blanket. It often moves away from my ear while i move when i sleep. One night I woke up to the sensation of a short, strong blow of air in my ear (my blanket had moved). I was confused if it was real or a dream, but I had a couple more sleep paralysis episodes that night so it seemed like a hallucination.

3. Getting dragged by my feet or lifted from under my arms

This is awful, because it feels so so real. It has happened multiple times. I wake up to the feeling of someone grabbing me from my feet and pulling me to the foot of my bed, or someone grabbing me from under my arms and trying to pull me underneath the bed. The awful feelind of ""actual"" hands grabbing you while u are unable to move is horrible. When i am able to move and open my eyes, I sometimes haven't really moved at all or sometimes i have moved to the place i was being dragged to. 

4. Other random stuff

I often hear my name called, my dishes crashing, my tv on or music playing etc during an episode. I have felt my hand go through items such as my phone in my hand or my wall. I've also clearly heard and felt a phone vibrating in the foot of my bed, and i really thought it was my actual phone when i was able to move because it felt so real - my phone was actually on the nightstand.

Anybody else with similar experiences?",1
Is it sleep paralysis when you can move?,"I mean, obvious answer is no... But I wake up to things sometimes. Standing over me. But I can move. 

Or I wake up feeling in my body? My body feels asleep. I can feel tingling all over and I can feel my chest rising and falling. I can feel my throat swallow. 

I've explained it to people and I was told it was sleep paralysis, but I can move. If I move, my body wakes up and the sensation goes away.",1
Positive sleep paralysis,"Last night I had a positive sleep paralysis experience and have been doing research to see if this has happened to anyone else. So far, I’ve found nothing.

So I woke up at around 4AM and couldn’t move. I had a positive sensation run from my head to my toes that felt orgasmic. I then heard a mans voice in my head say “fear not, fool”. “Fool” drifted off in a weird stereo way, like switching between one ear and the other. I then had full control over my body and felt energized. My cat quickly jumped on me and at first I was scared but then felt weirdly comforted and happy. I’ve felt amazing all day and my body has felt great. Has anyone had a positive experience like this before?",1
An earthquake with sleep paralysis,"I’m from Mexico and in 2017 we had a really strong earthquake. I feel like this event triggered a lot of anxiety for me and I started to be alert at all times, and now I get really scared easily. The first time I had SP was a week or so after the it happened, I woke up because I felt an earthquake, I was so overwhelmed and I tried to get up from bed and scream to let my family know what was happening but I couldn’t do so, I felt my bed shaking and I heard the walls cracking but I couldn’t do anything about it. When I woke up from it I was crying and I got up really quickly to see if it was real or if it was just a dream. At first I didn’t understand what was happening but after the third time I was sure I was suffering from SP. I’ve experienced it at least 10 times so far.",1
Yooooo gabapinten.,"So I talked my new psychiatrist about my sp. She popped me some gabapinten. Shit works for restless leg syndrome. Sure af works for sleep paralysis. so if it’s an on going issue for you this may be an option. 

Warning tho: makes the nightmares way worse. The sp was waking me out of them so they weren’t as bad. So get on that med card or call your dude and thc the dream world away. Also it only lasts 6 hours so you may wake up to one but I found when it’s light out there not as fucking scary. Just silly. 

Good luck. Hope I can help someone else out. Stay sane.... at least a little bit.

Edit a funny typo popped not pooped.  (I also messed it up wile typing this) my dr did not shit out the meds. I think that would be unprofessional, and astounding.",1
Acid triggered my sleep paralysis? help?,"its 5:57 am 7/1, i took acid the night before yesterday 6/29 and tripped from 11 pm-6 am then i was fine until i saw some visions around 7 pm yesterday until 10 pm when i fell asleep. i woke up at 2 am and I've been up since..

except i put on a Grumps video to sleep i saw maybe 1 min before shutting my eyes. immediately i was dreaming. i heard someone say ""it smells like"" and they took a sniff but my eyes snapped open and i realized the sniffing was real and behind me but i couldn't move. I felt the breath between each sniff it was like a dog. i shut my eyes and tried separating my jaw and kept trying to throw my arms. the thing stopped sniffing and i heard a creak. i felt like i was completely surrounded by static and it was over. i checked my laptop and it had literally been 2 minutes. I get an 'extra narrator' in my head when i take acid and the voice told me it was a giant dog demon thing and it's hiding in my closet. (no im not checking it)


This has never happened before when I've slept on acid or other drugs and I've only ever had one other paralysis experience but that was 2017. Can i get tips in case this happens again? Or if anyone can give me their opinion of what triggered it so i can avoid it?",1
Is “anxiety” connected to my SP?,"For as long as I’ve known, I could always predict when I’m about to have SP.  it’s this really hard tingling near my left armpit and every time I got it I would have my episodes. My friend has really bad anxiety and would have tingling on the tips of her fingers and said I probably have anxiety because of the tingling I get. I dislike self diagnosing in my opinion and I don’t find a reason to go to the doctor for “anxiety” (I’m quoting anxiety because I don’t know what the tingling is). I’m going to the doctor soon for me episodes since they’ve been like night terrors and I’ve been scared of going to sleep now.",1
Is this SP?,"Just before I get into what happened, this post is slightly graphic and there are mentions of blood, all within the possible sleep paralysis.

This was many years ago but I remember it pretty vividly. To start off, just for some context I move around a lot in my sleep so my mom put railing on the side of the bed I slept on to make sure that I wouldn't fall off, it was only on the one side. Also, on the side of the bed I slept on, looking at the railing there was about 1 ft space between the bed and the dresser, which held the TV, there was a window on the wall behind the dresser which had this white curtain covering it. It didn't split in the middle, you pulled it back from the sides.

So, I was around 5 or 6 and I woke up in the middle of the night. I couldn't move anything but I saw these 4 clowns standing right next to the bed, in between the bed and the dresser. The curtain over the window was moving as if there was a breeze passing through it, even though there was no fan on and the window had been closed when we went to bed. Going from closest to me to farthest away there was a green clown, orange clown, yellow clown, then red clown. They were all smiling very wide and creepily with none of their teeth touching, and they had razor sharp teeth dripping with blood. Their nails were also extremely sharp, and dripping blood.None of them moved for a few seconds until the red clowns grin stretched wider, and it's body elongated until it's head was right above mine. It's teeth dripped 2 drops of blood on me, slowly, as it's hands stretched towards me, and it's head got closer and closer to my face. As the 3rd drop of blood hit my face, everything went black until my eyes snapped open again, and they weren't there anymore. We didn't have a clock in my room so I didn't know what time it was or how much time had passed.

I didn't feel pain or anything, no pressure on my lungs or anything like that, just terror. When my eyes snapped open again, I could move, and to this day I'd not sure if it was sleep paralysis, a hallucination, or (very unlikely for what I saw and how the clowns acted and the fact that everyone that was in the house is still very much ok and alive) if they broke in through the window.

As such, I found this subreddit and wanted to know if this was actually sleep paralysis or not, it's the only time I've ever seen clowns like that ever, and if it was sleep paralysis, it's never happened again.",1
My first experience in over six months,"I’ve been dealing with sleep paralysis for a few years. It always only happens when I take naps. Never when I go to sleep for the night. This dream just happened to me a few moments ago. Before I took this nap, I texted my girlfriend of almost two years talking about how I plan on going on NoFap for 30 days and that I didn’t want to have sex the next time we met up (long distance college relationship; we’re scheduled to meet up again on 7/18). This adds some context because I’ve been internally dealing with the morality of masturbation/pornography for years. I told her in my text that I’m dedicating the month of July to semen retention. If anyone has an explanation given the context, please drop a comment. Here is my dream. 


It started off me being in the middle of this little league baseball field. Felt familiar like one that I’ve played at before. I was on this motorcycle. Before the nap, on my drive home, This guy on a motorcycle was doing all these crazy wheelies and showing off to other cars, so that could be why I’m on a motorcycle in the dream. I let the motorcycle go as fast as it can and I’m about to crash into the fence and a bunch of cars. I’m going so fast and I feel like I’m about to crash and I see myself about to crash, but I can’t crash. It’s almost like those dreams where you’re falling off a never ending cliff and when you get to the end you just wake up. 

Eventually, I get off the ground. The motorcycle and I are now flying in the air. I know something is guiding the motorcycle because I could feel that I didn’t have control over where it was going. I wasn’t in control over it. Someone else was. 

Next thing I knew I was flying into this church through its stain glass windows. It was the Catholic church my family and I have been going to all my life. I was still on the motorcycle, but inside hovering over the alter and the cross. A big shadow of a face appeared before me, much like paintings of Jesus with the long hair and beard, but he had a way longer nose. I asked, “what am I doing here? Why am I here?” I know sound came out of my mouth while I was sleeping because I was half awake and could feel vibrations. Probably wasn’t those words, but just mumbles. 

The next thing I knew I was half awake, but now I’m staring at my feet. I see the foot of the blanket being lifted and flipped around in waves. The fan is on, but the fan isn’t powerful enough to deliberately take the cover off of my body and waive it back and forth. I still feel the presence of someone else in the room. Next thing I hear is heavy breathing right next to me. Sounded like I was cuddling with my girlfriend listening to her breathe heavily as she slept. I thought that the something was a good something and I felt at ease. A few seconds later I feel that something reach around my legs and I see indents being put on my blanket and I feel hands. Then this something becomes restless and starts breathing heavier and sounds like it’s struggling. I feel the something then reach around my back side and I feel fingers around my butt. I then knew that this was not a good something. It was a bad something. The bad something reached its hands down my pants and tried to finger my ass; sexually violating me. I said audibly, “please stop” as that was the only thing I could do (or at least that’s what I think I said. In actuality, sleep paralysis speech is mumbles). I just had to let it do what it wanted because I couldn’t move. Then I finally gained control over my body again and jolted myself up to full consciousness.

If you’ve had a similar experience, especially if you’ve been dealing with sexual temptation or the morality surrounding sex and pornography, please drop a comment and share your thoughts. Thank you!",1
Family member sleep paralysis demon,"Weird question- why do I keep seeing my sister when I get sleep paralysis? It's not always but it's just often enough that It struck me as weird. When she left for college it stopped- and I expected it to start again when she came back but it hasn't. Does anyone know why? I'm not entirely convinced she wasn't just messing with me- but if she was, she has excellent timing. Is it, like, a psychological thing? She just stands there. I would appreciate if someone would tell me why cause this is getting weird.",1
Fell asleep on the couch and thought there was an earthquake. Tried to yell out for help (bf in the bed) and I couldn’t make a sound.,If felt like the quake lasted 3 minutes. I was trying to yell out to my boyfriend in the bedroom. I realized upon coming to that there wasn’t an earthquake as my dog and cat who both decided to sleep with me on the couch were out cold. Trying to yell help and being unable to was pretty scary but I have actually been interested in the idea of astral projection lately.  Realizing I might of blocked myself from going further out of fear.,1
"TIL that every single time I have remembered a dream in my adult life, it was in fact sleep paralysis.","So, I remember (as in, I am conscious of the fact that I had a dream at all) about one dream per every 6 month period. I’m using the term “remember “ rather loosely here, as if I do not immediately write down what few details I can bring out of the dream and into the conscious realm within .003 seconds upon waking, I will only be vaguely conscious of the fact that I had a dream upon actually waking up the next morning. By this point (hours after actually having the dream experience) any actual details of what went on in said dream are always long gone, unless as previously mentioned I had written them down immediately (which I’m usually incapable of doing cohesively). 

Anyways, onto the point. I just spent 2.5 hours in a state of sleep paralysis, stuck-dream that just keeps getting exponentially more fucked up and absurd the longer it drags out, where I was in fact actually paralyzed in the dream. I then googled sleep paralysis upon waking, because I had heard the term somewhere before, and this was an especially fucked up dream and has me still mentally fucked a good 30 minutes after waking later.....

Guys.....GUYS! Sleep paralysis is not being physically paralyzed IN THE DREAM.... it’s the feeling of being stuck half-way between dream state and reality. Where you’re consciously aware that you’re dreaming, but not in control of said dream and unable to wake yourself up. I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST WHAT DREAMING WAS. Every dream I’ve ever “had”, was not actually me dreaming like normal people, where you’re in control and it has the possibility of not being traumatizing...but actually me being held in sleep paralysis by the powers that be (or the sleep demon...or maybe the sleep demon IS the “powers that be”) EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. 

MY MIND IS BLOWN. AND I’M CONCERNED. 

(Also, this may not be coherent, I don’t think it will actually convey the epiphany I have had tonight since I’m not quite capable of writing a single sentence cohesively atm. Bear with me, I will try and edit tomorrow. Hopefully I have enough of the point down.)",1
does anyone else do this?,"i’ve had what i think is sleep paralysis for most of my life ever since i was a little girl. when i do get it i obviously am paralyzed and i can’t move. after im aware of the fact that i am in sleep paralysis (im not always aware) my consciousness shifts to “dream mode” and i start having weird or creepy dreams. obviously this is a very scary experience for me so i try to wake up out of sleep paralysis. does anyone else  try to get out instead of leaving it be? since my body is very exhausted, getting out is kinda painful and i have to “PUSH” myself out of sleep paralysis and i start shaking. if i dont push far enough im stuck. does anyone else do this?",1
"How to deal with SP when you're not actually ""conscious""?","I've had a couple of episodes of true paralysis, where I've been awake and frozen in place-- one in my bed and one after sleepwalking to my bedroom door-- but I also have episodes of something else several times a week.   


Usually, what it consists of is: I have a nightmare. At some critical point in the nightmare, I'm confronted with a ""demon"" which comes in various shapes. My entire body freezes up and I cannot move. Sometimes, I'm distantly aware of real-world things (the sensation of my bed, surrounding noises, light, etc.) as well as realizing that I'm dreaming, in which case I flit in and out of sleep and wakefulness, conscious of both worlds, until I manage to make a sound, which instantly breaks the paralysis. As you could imagine, this results in a lot of ""waking up screaming"".   


Other times, I don't realize I'm dreaming, and I'm just paralyzed in the world of my dream, usually by fear. I'm usually stuck for several seconds, and when I finally do move, it either jolts me into the half-awake-half-asleep realm, or drops me into a different section of the dream.  


I'm fairly certain these are all forms of SP. However, when I'm not able to gain cognizance of the fact that I'm dreaming, it's impossible to coach myself through dealing with the paralysis, because my dream self doesn't know what's happening. Do any of you experience similar symptoms, and if so, how do you deal with them? I'm consistently losing sleep from how anxious I am when I wake up from these episodes.",1
First auditory sleep paralysis,"I used to get SP back when I was struggling hard with anxiety, it never manifested visually or auditory. It was always behind or below me and I'd feel like I was being dragged along. Today I was dreaming I was at work (I work in a hall) and I heard a co-workers shoes squeaking on the floor and then it turned into full sprinting and then an incredibly loud rush that ended in a (quite stereotypical) demonic voice screaming ""I'm coming for you"". After not having it for years and never having experienced it that way it was terrifying to me and sent me into a panic attack, even though I knew exactly what it was.

I guess what I wanted to say was I have mad respect for those of you who get it auditory, because that was the worst experience I've ever had with it.",1
One hour of hell,"Recently I got another episode SP. I’ve been getting the “demons” lately and for this episode I saw this lady, her eyes were huge and per pupils were dilated, skin very pale and very dry, her lips were barely non existent with blood stained on it, her teeth were yellow and very separated, and she had no eye lids. She was staring at me for an hour, she did not move her mouth, her teeth were clenched, and she never blinked. For the whole hour she was screaming at me, if I could describe the sound it gave similarity to the goat man screaming and a mountain lion screaming. During this whole process I was at the point of not breathing at all. I have this weird thing going on when I get scared my head shakes rapidly during SP so on and off my head would shake really fast but my body was stiff. After that episode I just turned to the other side shaking and hoping that when I turn around I won’t see her. I’ve also got some trauma from this I guess, because now that I’m terrified of the dark again I see faces when it’s total darkness. I hate using the word anxiety but when I’m in the dark my gut drops and my ears ring with my stomach just wanting to jump out.",1
First two nights sober,"I spent Friday through Sunday night drinking and smoking and sleeping with someone else. Yesterday night and tonight were my first nights sober and I got some bad paralysis and nightmares.

Oooold story,"Decided that, since i found this subreddit, might as well share my one story of SP.

It was AGES ago, like around age 5 (so 16 years since oof), that this happened. It was outright textbook for the first bit. I has panicked a bit but not as much as when i looked into the doorway. Standing in it was basically the silhouette of someone. Stood there for a bit, idk how long tho. Obv being 5 this was already terrifying, but so much so that when it began to move towards me, my brain just noped out and i passed out. It was by far an interesting experience, and a tiny weird part of me wants it to happen again for a fresher memory of it but also id rather not have it again as well.

Short but eh, its the story.",1
Why do people experience vibrations during sleep paralysis?,"I get sleep paralysis semi-frequently (I'm fortunate not to have any terrifying hallucinations), and every time, I experience the sensation of my body vibrating, similar to a cell phone. It's accompanied by buzzing noises. However, it's not constant. It comes and goes like waves, occurring maybe once or twice a second. I can also normally wiggle out of it and wake myself up by moving the tips of my fingers to ""wake"" my body up.

Anyways, I've noticed that this is a very common hallucination, and I'm a very science-minded person, so I'm wondering if there's a specific reason why this hallucination is so common. What's physically going on in my brain when this happens? Is it a coincidence that others experience this also?

I have trouble finding any article that explains it to my liking, but one person on the internet explained that it could be due to the brain changing brain wave frequency while going into REM sleep, and in this state, I can hear the brain waves. I haven't found any scientific article explaining this, so I'm not sure if that's true.",1
My demon Lindy,"2018 I was at a luau party and I slept over at my friends house. During sophomore year I would get sleep paralysis almost every night but never see the “demons”. Until that night, where I would usually get a tingling feeling near my left armpit. When I got SP I saw this pale white lady, orange hair, a white dress. I was hearing multiple tiny whispers that were inaudible but she was just staring at me for about 20 mins. I told my friend that hosted the party this year and he told me he has a painting of her that was hidden in the basement. He said he saw that girl when he was like 5 but it wasn’t that intense as mine. This Saturday I went back to that house and this time I only heard whispers for a solid minute and asked my friends if they heard the whispering too.... they didn’t.",1
My first sleep paralysis,"I've experienced sleep paralysis once in my life and it was like 3 or 4 weeks ago

Anyway, it was a normal night when I was sleeping, I had a couple normal dreams until it was 3 or 4 am... It started by me in my room, alone, in the dark and suddenly, the room was full of flying figures which terrified me. I tried screaming mom Dad but it was useless so I tried figuring if it was a dream. Unfortunately, I was eyes wide open seeing these creatures float, then they all dissapeared except one that started getting closer and closer to me, I tried to scream with all I had but my screams were just barely whipers. Luckily, my dad was awake at the time just to go to the bathroom near my bedroom and go sleep. He heard my whispers and came into my room and as soon as he got in, the figure was gone. I was fully awake and did not even blink rich made me sure that was 100% a sleep paralysis

To be honest it still terrifies me to this moment and I get chills everytime I remember that scenery

First sleep paralysis in a very long time...,"Five years ago, I had a problem with recurring sleep paralysis. I would have it almost every other night and sometimes, multiple times during the same night.  Coincidentally, it was during one of the lowest times of my life  — it was my senior year of high school so I was stressed and I was also spiraling into depression. It was such a traumatic time and the sleep paralysis just added to all of it. Nevertheless, my experiences with recurring sleep paralysis did not remain as frightening as they were in the beginning. I didn't have any visual hallucinations, almost always just in the pitch black darkness while the other times were in fleshy darkness (like looking through my eyelids, if that makes sense) if there's a light in my room. I did have some auditory hallucinations, but most notable was a ringing that kept on getting louder and louder and I thought that my head was going to explode. But after a while, it became more like a nuisance and just another stress because it kept me from getting needed sleep when I was already barely getting any because of my depression. Then, I found a solution: sleeping on my side rather than on my back. And just like that, my sleep paralysis went away. And so every night for the last five years, I slept on my side. 

Fast forward to two days, I had my first sleep paralysis in a very long time. I was sleeping on my side. And just like that, my security blanket was taken away. And not only that but it was the most frightening sleep paralysis I've had yet because of the visual hallucinations and how dream-like they seemed. And maybe, they were actually dreams  — because it began as that. I don't exactly remember all the details of my dream but it began with me having sleep paralysis (and so I thought I was having one) but then in that dream, I woke up and I can't remember more except that I was running out of my room only to stop because I saw a figure (made of shadow?). After seeing that shadow figure, I woke up except I was actually having sleep paralysis that time.  It was so frightening because I wasn't sure if I was still dreaming and the anxious person that I am, I immediately thought that I'd be stuck in that cycle forever. 

I don't know how to end this post but yeah, that's my first sleep paralysis in a very long time and definitely not looking forward to more. I also thought that the dream inception thing was me having an out-of-body experience or astral projecting but that's probably a reach lmao. Anyway, sleep tight y'all.",1
My sleep paralysis,"I used to only get these episodes once every few years and thought it was like a guardian spirit telling me to be careful or watch out. Until I finally had a therapist tell me it was SP.  every time I get it.  I never see a figure.  I’m usually where I am but a hidden figure comes always out of my sight and lays on top of me.  Holding me down till I four el a muffled scream to wake me up. It’s started happening more frequently and I’ve started writing down every experience. Here’s my last one that really freaked me out. 

“When I sleep I have a tv on or music playing to help me drift off. I was dreaming before it happened no problems blend a nice pleasant dream.  Then it happened. I felt my eyes open and I was back in my room with my bed. I could see the tv as closed and opened my eyes the room changes. Lights went on in the dream and new furniture was in new places.  I felt my self drift more Into the dream world, as I did the harder it was to keep my eyes open.  I could still hear the tv playing from my room. I felt myself fall off of the bed and couldn’t get up in my dream, think of chest to the ground, legs up the side of the bed, with one ear planted to the floor...then I felt it first it was a hand petting my back then a body with a head by my ear.  I couldn’t see who but it felt different.  I called out my friends name “Carly” but no answer then I heard it speak in a deep guttural voice it said “feed me” I felt myself eying to push an internal scream out to wake up like I taught myself then I felt it.  It was a mouth sinking it’s teeth in my back.  I felt the sharp pain and it jolted me wake.  I took a few seconds to make sure I was awake and I was now I lay in bed slightly afraid to sleep right away but I know I will in a bit just have to come down. “",1
Will I get SP?,I have never had sleep paralysis but i’ve been reading about it and i it seems pretty spooky so i just want to know if I will most likely never have it if i haven’t for 16 years,1
6/29/20,"When I get SP, I get it right when I’m about to sleep. Before I get SP I will get a tingling sensation on my left armpit, I was having it so I went to sleep just to get over it. First round I just had trouble breathing more than usual and I couldn’t open my eyes. Second round it was easier to breathe but I could barely move so it was really hard to wake up. Third round I had a tingling sensation all over my body and I couldn’t move again because Everytime I moved the tingling will get more sensitive. I was planning to sleep at 11:00 pm but instead I fell asleep around 3:00-4:00.",1
"[CW:Rape] I was ""raped"" during SP","this is a backstory: when i was 17 i was raped by someone i thought was a friend. it was in a different country and since then i've moved and for the most part i've been safe. 
I've experienced sleep paralysis a lot a few years back. i wanna be clear, i wasn't actually raped by another person while experiencing sleep paralysis, but i felt it. it was like a recreation of my actual rape which to say the least fucked me up. I've heard things, seen things and even was ""dragged"" by my ankle during sleep paralysis but never something like this, never this invasive. this was maybe a couple of years ago, i haven't experienced sleep paralysis since that one.

edit: i've experienced sp before being raped so it's not like it was a trigger or anything idk",1
Time of sp,"Hi, when do you experience sleep paralysis? Why is it that I experience it in the morning and not at night. Guess I would consider myself lucky to have non scary sp. The sun is up but I cant move can only look around my room.",1
Snake entity,"I had an episode today due to lack of sleep and this is my 5th time having one. I have the normal episodes eyes open, unable to move, screaming no one could hear me, etc...But this time it was different, I was more aware that I was asleep and simply told my brain to calm down. That was all good until I felt and heard a snake. I didn't see it but I could feel it wrapped around my body leaving me paralyzed. I could very strongly hear the hissing in my ears and just before I woke up I felt it pierce my neck. I woke up flinching and that was it. This was my first time having an animal as my paralysis person and I just wanted to see if anyone else has had one too. Anyhoo thank u for reading",1
Is this sleep paralysis or not?,"Now typically people usually say during sleep paralysis you're unable to do anything but you see figures in your room or on your chest etc, so I'm unsure as to if I'm experiencing something different, usually when sleeping I will dream, now every night I always have lucid dreams but some nights I don't and am unable to control my dream, these usually play out as a story of a stranger and play snippets and details of their life, before suddenly I feel as if I'm awake and can't move, my vision turns red and the strangers face will be staring close at me before making a sound. For example one night I had this dream of a old looking Catholic woman in victorian clothing, I saw images of church's and other religious things, then suddenly out of nowhere it happened, I couldn't do anything I couldn't wakeup or move, my vision went red and see stared at me then screamed so loud, I was terrified I couldn't do anything until I managed to snap out of it and wiggle my finger which helped me gain control and wake up. I had a different story too, it was of a clown, down on his luck, getting nowhere and being fired from the circus, then my vision went red he stared at me and I heard demonic laughter, I couldn't do anything at all.

I'm sorry I'm rambling on but I'm genuinely unsure as to what this is. Now I don't see these figures in my room their in my dream, but I don't think it's a nightmare because I know when I have nightmares I can easily wakeup and move.

Feel free to ask me any questions. Thank you for reading.",1
My First Experience,"I had my first sleep paralysis experience this morning. It’s my day off, and I wasn’t feeling well, so I was laying on my couch watching Seinfeld. I nodded off for about 15 minutes. I woke up to the sound of the door closing. I live with one other person. She and I are the only ones with the key.

I kept trying to open my eyes and I couldn’t. I tried pushing myself up and I couldn’t. Then I swear I felt a dog come up to me. The only pet in our house is a fish. And a man was telling the dog to leave me alone. That I was asleep. I kept trying to open my eyes or move and I couldn't. But somehow I knew the guy was my dad. My dad lives 1100 miles away though. But when he spoke the man transformed into like a smaller man with a thick Mexican accent?? Then he kinda laughed. Not like a creepy way. Like when you'd fall asleep as a kid in the car and your parents would carry you to your room and put you to bed. Like that vibe.

Then they left. And when the door was closing I was finally able to move and open my eyes.",1
Now im not so sure I will be ok when I die.,"had paralyisis again this morning. Idk. I thought I was dead. I sat up and looked to my side and I was sitting right beside my body. I started to stand up and instead like floated up a few feet. Ive been through that before and I'm sure I left my body. When I spun to the doorway there was something dark like a shadow person in the doorway so all I could think was to lay  back down inside my body. Then I woke up and took a second to move any part of me but I could hear myself like gurgling sounds in my throat and when I sat up my lungs felt like they were going to explode they had like deflated and stayed there, it was a struggle to get air enough to get a full breath. Eventful little nap. Fuck",1
Was that Sleep Paralysis,"Okay so I’ve had sleep paralysis a lot of times over the years and I kind of got used to them. Had several scary experiences but not too bad, especially considering what other people go through. But one instance that happened a while ago still kind of confuses me. I was sleeping on my side and I woke up and rolled onto my back and suddenly my breathing got really fast, and I felt a pressure on my chest and had an overwhelming feeling of fear, similar to my other sleep paralysis episodes. However, I didn’t feel paralyzed, I was still able to roll, so I rolled back onto my side and suddenly everything stopped, I felt normal, breathing slowed down and pressure was gone. Then I was confused so I rolled onto my back again so I could sit up and suddenly everything came back, the pressure, the fear, and I started breathing really fast. Needless to say I slept on my side the rest of that night but it still confuses me. It had all the elements of sleep paralysis, except I wasn’t paralyzed (Or if I was, it was for a few seconds, but not like my other sleep paralysis moments). 

Has anyone had a similar instance like this? It may not be sleep paralysis but idk what else it could be. It felt like this hotspot on my bed made me feel overwhelmingly scared, made my breathing erratic and placed a pressure on my chest.",1
Still scared af despite being well used to it.,"Hi,
So I have GAD which is probably the main reason why I do a ton of sleep paralysis. I also occasionally take drugs for fun which tends to trigger it more and make it more intense. I'm turning 25 and I'd say it happens more or less regularly since around 10 years 

Back to my very first real long sleep paralysis I thought it was the scariest shit ever. Eventually i found out what it was and realised I had it many times before but different. Especially when I was working on lucid dreams experimenting, and nailed it, usually I would wake up in sleep paralysis. I remember a very very very scary early one where I saw my dream blinking with my room. I was focusing on trying to look at my hands cause it's supposed to be a technique to wake up, but I just couldn't..I felt like I would be stuck in the other dimension forever. After that I never tried to ""play"" with lucid dreams again but I had acquired skills in naturally being able to identify when I dream and how to wake up especially from nightmares.

After the first time once you really understand it, it's supposed to be less scary. There was a period of my life where I would do a sleep paralysis as soon as I would fall asleep on my back. After the use of drugs it would be almost as soon as I close my eyes. 

I got really used to the ""sober"" ones. When I'm starting to realize I'm doing a sleep paralysis, I learnt to not panic, I know how to react, I know what's going on, it's not nice but I can deal with it and usually I'm not too scared anymore.

These last few months it got rarer. I found myself many times sleeping on my back and not doing sleep paralysis which could never happen before.
_____________________________________________
So today I got drunk and fell asleep on my back.
I had a sleep paralysis, extremely short but intense.
I'm still shivering thinking about it, my heart is still racing. 
I suddenly felt like if I was on the top of someone who was closing their arms on my body holding me very strongly, the arms in the level of my neck, preventing me to breath, and I started to hallucinate about the wall in front of me, which made me understand I was starting a sleep paralysis. I felt like i was coughing blood and couldn't breathe in the same time and felt like if I was choking. I felt like if I was screaming, shaking, even tho I didn't feel like I was trying to cause I was aware it was a sleep paralysis and the attitude I know I must have is to stay calm. But it was so fucking intense, I felt an extremely violent freezing wind going through my body , I'm still feeling cold right now.  And yeah  the stuffs on my wall looked like a threatening humanoid thing starring at me. Omg I'm shivering so hard. 
Then... Then I managed to wake up. My light is on, I felt asleep like that. It's 2am. I'm not feeling like turning off the lights or trying to sleep straight away.
_________________________________________________

 So I thought I would check if there was a sleep paralysis community and share a bit my experience.

I used to think sleep paralysis could happen to me only when I'm on my back and when I slept alone but it happened in any circumstances. I have to say tho than in 99% of the cases I was on my back.
So if you have issues with sleep paralysis, even tho everyone is probably telling you the same, I just want to say, DO NOT sleep on your back. It's a real trigger. 

Yeah idk that's it for now maybe I'm gonna scroll on this sub and play some games maybe to relax lol.
Sleep paralysis are terrifying. Thanks for reading.",1
Experiences with sleep paralysis.,When I was about 16 I remember I would get sleep paralysis about every day. Sometimes I would get it napping during the day or at night. I would always feel when it was coming and I would say to myself ah here we go again it’s gonna happen. Sometimes I would just lay there not baking able to move and I would fight whatever it was that felt like was overcoming me . One time I decided I was not gonna fight it and just let it take over me so I did that but the more I let it take over me i felt terrible so I immediately began to fight it again and try to move . There was times when I could here sounds so loud that they hurt my ears once I heard the sounds of dogs barking . Once I heard a demon growling or at least that’s what it sounded like. The last time I experienced sleep paralysis was a couple months ago after talking about it with a friend I later experienced sleep paralysis that same night .,1
Controlling sleep paralysis,"This is probably a stupid statement/question, but since in lucid dreams, you can control what you see/the plots of it, why wouldn’t we be able to control what we see during sleep paralysis since you’re aware that it is? There’s probably science proving why you can’t, but it just got me thinking.",1
Frequent SP randomly goes away,I had SP on and off before it became nearly a nightly thing randomly it just went away and I haven't had it for a nearly two months and I can't figure out why,1
Sleep paralysis or something else?,"Hello,

When I was approximately 15 years old ( am 30 now), I experienced the sensation and have memories of being dragged along my floor from my bed while sleeping. I awoke later on in the AM in my bed with no ill effects and never had that particular sensation again, aside from sleep paralysis and the sensation of being watched and doors opening, people looking at me, etc. 

That sensation of being dragged along my floor has stuck with me as my all time weirdest occurence at night, and I have not seen anyone comment or post about anything like that. At the time I was listening to alot of black metal music, smoking and drinking and had a poor relationship with my family. Perhaps I was being visited by a demonic entity? Please advise, thanks",1
Sleeping medication that do not induce/worsen SP?,"Hi there! I occasionally have sleep paralysis. Besides that, for a very long time i've also been having trouble falling asleep at a reasonable time, often i won't fall asleep before 6 am so that greatly fucks up my day rhythm. 

To help me fall asleep in time, my doctor has prescribed me a benzodiazepine before; temazepam. However, trying this once became a total sleep paralysis fest; it was just 8 hours on-and-off sleep paralysis. So I was definitely not feeling rested in the morning (and to be honest was kind of traumatised.)

The only other things I've tried besides this are CBD (doesnt really help with sleeping in) and melatonin (also induced my SP, but less extreme than temazepam though.)

My question; is there anybody that also had this problem with temazepam (or maybe another benzodiazepine) but most importantly; does anybody have a good experience with a sleeping medication that did not induce/worsen their sleep paralysis? 

(Sleeping in is the main problem - once I'm asleep I'll sleep through the night perfectly well, luckily!). Really hope anybody has some suggestions and experiences to share, would love to have a proper sleeping pattern again.",1
Is this sleep paralysis?,"A few nights ago I kind of felt my body going to sleep, either that or I woke up the same time I was going to sleep and was paralyzed, but it last like a split second. I looked up why this could have happened and saw the thing about tricking your mind to think you’re asleep when you’re not, but as the idiot I am, I purposely tried this again. When I did I I felt a painful vibration, I assume this was just the feeling of entering deep sleep that I’m not suppose to feel, but it seemed I was going in and out of a dream.

Every time I focused on a specific object (in this case a game controller, not sure why, I’d enter this room full of bleachers, it was a lucid dream because I was aware that I was dreaming, but when I stopped focusing on said object, I appeared at the foot of my bed, couldn’t move, and it felt so real I was expecting my dad to come in and I’d had to explain that maybe I was sleep walking.

I focused on the object again, appeared back in this gym, but then when I stopped focusing, suddenly I was hanging from the ceiling, my tv was n the ground below me, and everything was out of my room besides the bed. So I started to freak out and was trying to force myself to wake up, I’d slowly be opening my eyes, but they felt glued shut, but it’s like I was seeing the dream world and real world simultaneously. 

Was this a rare form of sleep paralysis? Was I actually just paralyzed in my bed, but I hallucinated my whole room being completely different, and laying on the foot of my bed as I quickly switched between that and a lucid dream?",1
witnessing sp,"I just wanted to start off by saying that my dad was the one who was having SP, or at least i think it is. so i stay up later than my dad and was staying on the bed next to his when all of a sudden i heard him sorta groaning and mumbling. he was slurring his words, said a few things that wasn’t clear  but it sound like he was arguing for a few seconds, then i heard him try to say “wake... me... up” when i finally did i asked him what was he dreaming about and he told me that he wasn’t dreaming, he said that he couldn’t see, talk or move but he heard my brother and i talking on my bed (my brother wasn’t in the room). he never mentioned anything about feeling pressure on his body though but something similar happened when i was younger and sleeping in the same room. at that time he did feel like someone was pushing his body down while not being able to talk/move. i remember feeling so scared that night.",1
My Worst Experience,"Several years ago I lived in a crappy makeshift apartment which was made out of the top floor of my girlfriend’s parent’s house. It was a really  run down old house in a dead industrial town in Pennsylvania. The apartment itself was basically a repurposed attic. It had the angled ceilings and those creepy little doors in the walls. There was no line for a stove in the “kitchen” and the walls were probably made out of asbestos. It was a really grim little place but we were so poor back then. We tried to make the best of it. My girlfriend told me that it was haunted but I didn’t really believe her at first. 

Anyway, one night we made a spot on the floor and stayed up all night watching movies. It must have been around 5 in the morning by the time I turned off the TV. My girlfriend was already fast asleep at this point but I still wasn’t tired. The birds were already chirping outside and the room was fairly bright from our dim little window. I figured I should try and get some sleep but I couldn’t keep my eyes closed. My restless mind ran over mundane chores that I had to do later, making an inventory in my mind. I wasn’t drifting off at all. I was just looking up at the sky, debating whether or not I should just get up and start my day. Then, I noticed something emerging up from under my blanket. I was immediately paralyzed. It looked like a hunched figure draped underneath my blanket near my feet. I watched in terror as the mass under the blanket slowly crawled up closer to me. I could feel a sort of twisted ball of limbs on top of my chest as it got to my torso. It was holding down my hands. This thing was almost up to my face when I felt a huge swell of courage in my chest. I still couldn’t move my body and my hands were still bound but I could feel my “soul’s” arm break free (if that makes sense). I was able to form a readied fist. The figure immediately stopped. It actually seemed taken aback. In that moment I wasn’t scared anymore. All of my fear melted away. I was ready for it to show some sort of burnt, gnarled, ugly face. I was ready to crush it back into dust with my imaginary fist. Then, something unexpected happened. In a split second it pushed up the rest of the way. Instead of a grotesque face that I could punch, a ton of swirling dark gray and black smoke rushed out and filled the entire room. The smoke completely blotted out the light from the window and it became dark as night in the room. At this point I lost my shit and started writhing (still paralyzed) trying to break free. Finally, in the snap of a finger it all stopped. I was laying there, just as before, looking out the window. The room was still. Same lighting, it was still early morning.  My girlfriend was still sleeping by my side. Time hadn’t passed. I had to literally pinch myself. It’s like I woke up but I was never asleep. This was exactly like one of those stereotypical dream sequences in a horror movie.  

At the time I rationalized that it must have been an extremely vivid dream. But looking back I don’t know. I’ve had very mild sleep paralysis before but it happened to me when I was drifting off to sleep or just waking up. There were never any entities and I just had to rock myself for a minute to break out of it. This was different. I just snapped into and out of a nightmare with vivid clarity and no memory of ever falling asleep. Perhaps it all actually did happen and I was just frozen with fear :-/",1
I woke up from my SP dream into another SP dream.,"Recently I keep having a spiral of SP dreams as the title states. So I’ll be in a SP dream only to “wake up” into another SP dream and so on. Last night I didn’t think it would end, I “woke up” about 4 or 5 times, by the end I was begging to wake up for real. After that I couldn’t get back to sleep, every time I felt myself drifting off I had to move my head just to make sure I wasn’t going into SP again, which of course led to no sleep.

Anyone else experience similar? Any way to combat this?",1
Has anyone ever realized in a dream you were about to go into sleep paralysis?,"I’ve had it happen to me a few times before. I’ll feel like I’m about to faint or I feel like I’ve been drugged in a dream and then immediately I’m in paralysis. I’ve even had times where I’ve become lucid before it happens. I remember I was in a dream and began feeling incredibly weird. I told my brother in my dream “Shit, I think I’m about to pass out and go into sleep paralysis”. Sure enough I did. I can’t really describe the weird feeling I get in my dreams, I just feel like this really strong sensation in my body thats like I’m losing myself",1
Can someone tell me wether or not I was having sleep paralysis,So as of recently every night before I’ve gon to sleep I’ve choked the chicken and right after I’ve been falling asleep pretty easily but just two days ago I was told i would be going back home for like two weeks (Milwaukee Wisconsin). So with this time back home to see my family I thought maybe this would be a good time to take a break from my normal endeavors that I partake in every night before I go to bed so I get to my grand parents house after a two hour plane ride followed by a 4hr joy ride around town and I’m exhausted so I fall asleep and my first set of dreams are fine and since it was early when I fell asleep I ended up waking up at like 1 am so I stay up for about 2 hrs watching YouTube then I decide it’s probably time for me to go back to sleep. The thing about me is that if I’m forcing my self to sleep then I have to start thinking of random things and I have to make up stories in my head and then slowly but surely I’ll fall sleep. So after probably about 5mins of me doing that ( just an estimate because who can really tell time when trying to sleep) it works but I end up having really aggressive dreams about sex and they were sooooo vivid. Now this is normal because In the past I’ve tried to stop this unhealthy obsession and I’ve had dreams like this so it didn’t really stand out to me as something that weird the only difference is that this dream was a little stronger. So I wake up again but then I notice the air vent was on and it was blowing so cold so I clasped my hands together and put them in between my legs and layed on my side. I fell asleep but this time I felt like my eyes were open so I looked to the right of me and the pillow I was laying on was white and swirls shaped like a statue appeared from it and then I looked down the pillow and the same thing happened but this time a chicken appeared ( I have no idea why) but then I shifted my eyes to the left to look down at my feet and I realized I couldn’t move and in the room I’m in there’s a black spin chair in front of me but it looked it started to move and then a black shadow zipped across the room. I was terrified so I closed my eyes and woke up. Sorry for the long ass story but I just felt the need to give all the details so can anyone tell me what this was and if it was sleep paralysis?,1
"Experiencing double vision, extreme fatigue?","I’ve been getting SP very often these past two months, probably 3-4 nights a week and it happens over and over again throughout the night to the point where I just wake up at two AM and don’t go back to sleep. I used to be able to get up for an hour then go back to sleep but that’s not working anymore. I just keep going back into paralysis. 

Now I’ve noticed that when I force myself out of paralysis there is a period of time that lasts between 10-30 minutes where I experience double vision or an inability to focus my vision, blurriness and extreme fatigue to where if I stand I get vertigo and can’t walk straight, can’t keep my eyes open, and struggle to move my arms even though I’m fully awake and moving. I also have longer and longer periods after paralysis where I can’t think straight, like I could literally just stare at a wall for an hour and if someone spoke to me I probably wouldn’t register it. Has anyone else very had anything like this? It freaks me out and I know I’m really losing sleep but I dread it now.",1
Paranoid about falling asleep,"I used to get sleep paralysis all the time when I was really little. Back then, there were no hallucinations or anything. It was just mildly annoying because I couldn’t move for a few seconds after I woke up. I hadn’t had an episode in maybe 6-8 years, however, in the last few weeks, I’ve been experiencing sleep paralysis pretty frequently. This time, there have been hallucinations, and they’ve been pretty intense. So far, it’s only been limited to sensory (a feeling of being held down in bed, someone putting their hands on me, etc.) and auditory hallucinations (several voices speaking/ laughing incoherently behind me, one voice in particular usually whispering but sometimes shouting my name). These experiences have gotten gradually more intense. The first few were even kinda cool and fun to tell my friends about, but now it’s not fun at all and actually pretty terrifying. I legitimately am afraid I would have a panic attack or something if they get any worse and I see some shadow monster or creepy kid standing at the foot of my bed. I know this might be a dumb question, but can anyone here pass on their advice for overcoming this fear of sleeping? Better yet, is there any real way to stop this? 
Any help is appreciated.",1
"Sleep Paralysis, but was able to struggle and move","I believe I experienced my first ever dose of SP today, but it seemed rather unusual with what I’ve heard from the community. 

It began with being unable to open my eyes. It felt as though my eyes had crust in them or something and were stuck together. I struggled for about 5-10 seconds to open them while moving my head, but my arms were unable to move to help during this time. I was finally able to open my left eye and suddenly I was frozen with one eye open and the left side of my head against my pillow. In that moment I felt pressure on my bed like someone was sitting right next to me where I was looking. Even saw the bed sink in.

I began taking deep breaths and realized somewhat that I was dealing with SP, but everything was strikingly real. After a few moments of taking deep breaths and struggling to move the pressure next to me subsided and I was able to throw my right arm over my body towards the edge of my bed. Then I was frozen again for a few seconds and felt that whatever it was, was in the far right corner of my room now. I was unable to see it due to my right eye being unable to open and where it was being just out of sight. 

After trying very hard to open my right eye I was able to move my right arm. Which I used to appropriately give the area where the thing was the middle finger while yelling “fuck you bastard!” This allowed my body more freedom to move in a kind of delayed for a second jerky motion. I used this to climb out of bed in an attempt to open my electric powered blinds on my window (it was day time). 

When reaching the window by jerkingly crawling to it I was unable to remember which side the button was on and realized I was dreaming again. I had to resort to putting my eye near the crack in the blinds, but once again whichever eye I got close to the light would be closed. I thought to myself “this is some bullshit I can’t even get light in this nightmare?” And then I woke up laying in the exact position where this experience started.

I wasn’t afraid when I woke up, just groggy and disoriented. I find the experience fascinating and my reaction to the perceived threat somewhat funny. I don’t believe in demons, but any explanation or classification of this experience would be awesome! 

It seemed like a lucid dream with some SP symptoms I was fighting against.

Thanks 🤙🏻",1
Is there a reason I've been getting sleep paralysis for over 10 years?,"I remember my first sp episode, I was in like 8th grade and I couldn't move, I could see my door and it was banging so hard that I can see the door move with every pound. I snapped out of it and brushed it off. Then through out high school I'd get it maybe once or twice a month. Now for the past 3-4 years I've been getting sp at least twice a week. Sometimes it's really bad, like 5 times a week. Before I would see things, usually the same ""person"". But I would say that 80% of the time I just can't move, get a horrible pain in my gut, and I feel like i'm just watching myself. I can see myself struggling to wake up.
Im pretty much used to it now but there are times I still panic.
Is it like a disorder or something? I heard it's related to stress but it's been acting up more these past years, even though I'm happier then I was before.",1
Strange episode,"I had a strange sleep paralysis episode a year ago or so where I was awake, I heard that loud humming noise as usual, but instead of seeing a figure or anything like that, I “fell” out of my bed and could see under my bed and everything. I never hit the ground, I instead levitated a couple inches above it. Eventually I woke up/was able to move again and was extremely confused for a few seconds because I thought I had fallen. My eyes were open during the whole thing, too.

Has an experience like this happened to anyone else?",1
Sleep paralysis.,"Any advise for someone with sleep paralysis.like how to stop it. I just woke up after six false awakening's and it is really concerning me. I felt like i couldn't breath. I also feel mentally drained I am struggling to type this even. Its like my hands won't cooperate with my mind. And i feel so foggy and mentally drained. I hope this makes sense and, please forgive my bad grammar. Goodnight reddit.",1
What is my sleep paralysis demon?,"So I haven't had it in a few weeks but my last one was of me waking up and knowing it was sleep paralysis, then I was able to move my legs and at the foot of my bed I saw a child with the face of pure evil. The thing is I wasn't scared though, it reminded me of the ""thrill"" of when my dad was still alive since iv'e felt kind of numb since he died years ago (think of it as life or adrenaline). I could crawl on my bed and as I got close I still wasn't afraid. I called to my dad and reached my hand out and at that moment I woke up. Can anyone give me any insight?",1
Terrifying experience last night,"Sleep paralysis is nothing new for me, and usually when it happens I recognize it for what it is and have even used it as a path to lucidity. Last night was different. I never felt as if I was fully asleep. I often get stuck in ""half sleep"" for lack of a better term. It felt as if people were in the house and were planning to attack me. I couldn't see them, but I could hear them. I screamed multiple times, at least one of which was a real scream because it woke up my husband who was sleeping in another room last night, trying to get a decent night's sleep, lol. I kept having false awakenings. Not sure how long this went on, but it felt like hours. Finally I actually woke up and got out of bed to fully wake up before trying to sleep again.

I'm scared to go to sleep tonight. Does anyone have any tips? Commiseration is fine too!",1
New Parent Sleep Paralysis,It has happened every night for months now. My baby has slept in her own room since 4 months but I keep dreaming that she’s in the bed with us. I can’t move to wake up and grab her. I often hear her or feel her moving around the bed when she’s not there. My mental health is really suffering from the constant since of panic I feel. Any other new parents out there that experience something similar?,1
Rare sleep paralysis as a kid.,"I know it is rare to have sleep paralysis as a kid but my age was 9 years old I had my own room and my friends as a child would tell me scary stories I freaked out! As I was going to sleep Every night I would hear noises from the room next to me.A couple of nights later I could hear screaming and I really wanted to know what it was but I was too scared to move.I told my parents that I could hear screaming at night but they told me to not think much of it.

The week later I could see the window smash in my dreams but I didn't know if it was sleep paralysis or just magic because the night after, the window smashed and it lead to me thinking whether its sleep paralysis or not.",1
My sleep paralysis experience,"I was having those episodes of sleep paralysis for about 5-6 years that stopped about 3 years ago.
I was recently discovered that it's a thing.. and not a personal experience I had so I wanted to share my experience and get some people who experienced the same thing maybe to help me figure what was it all about.

My most intense sleep paralysis experience was about 5 years ago at the age of 25.
I woke up in my room and saw my digital clock saying it's 3:33.
Then I saw two shadow figures standing to my left right on the side of the bed, they seemed to be talking with other since the left one had his head towards the one to his right.
They were made of shadow but had a ""laser"" like blue light surrounding them on the edges.. like a border.
I was trying to scream so bad, I couldn't move which what I had experienced in previous sleep paralysis but this was something else.. since I saw those figures.
I tried really hard and was able to lift my head jus t a lil bit above the pillow and moved my leg left and right at this point the left shadow was turning his head instantly toward me, both of them looking at me although was madeof shadow they both seemed surprised that I was able to move. Then at the same point the left one was putting a hand on my face and leg putting my head back on the pillow and moving my leg back into the bed. At the same time I woke up terrified..and saw the digital clock was 3:34.

I turned on the lights and was going to sleep with lights on for 2 years.. until I met my wife which had me to turn them off.
I did have more then a few sleep paralysis experience since.. but this was the most intense one.

Did anyone experience anything similar? With those kind of shadow figures with blue laser border? That's something which I carry for years trying to understand what happened. I was to thinking it was an hallucinations, but since a lot of people experience this, Im not so sure.about it anymore.",1
Lucid Dreaming for SP,Would anyone be interested in learning Mindfulness Based Lucid Dreaming here? I’m hoping to shed light on SP and help people reframe the experience from something horrible to something interesting and fun.,1
Painful sleep paralysis experience,"I've had sleep paralysis for about a year now it usually comes and goes but for the first few months of having it it would become an increasingly worse experience and would be nightly the worst experience I had, I had fallen asleep and gotten sleep paralysis and I would always experience drowning as I fall asleep to the point it would feel like I was taking my last breath( I believe this was related to nearly drowning as a kid I believe the memory was locked in my brain which is why it always felt so real) but I fell asleep and throughout the night I got sleep paralysis I think I got it like 5 times each time I would wake up to it feel like I was drowning then fall back asleep. I remember the more it happened the more I became mixed up in if I was awake or asleep I kept feeling like the time was changing once I looked at my clock and it was 5 then Id look back a few minutes later but it was really 3 I got so freaked out I had to text my friend to figure out what time it was. After a few of my regular experiences of sleep paralysis it started changing I would wake up to it and It felt like someone was taking their hand and shoving it through my skull and wrapping it around my brain and was trying to pull my brain out of my head it was the most pain I've ever experienced in my life and it's terrifying to know it was all in my head and not real, that my brain could even not only process but create that much pain to itself. It got to the point I felt like I was going insane.",1
SP while sleeping on my stomach,"I'm back in my home country after completing an exchange program abroad. The trip took almost a whole week due to how spread out flights are right now. It was stressful and I'm glad it's over now. 

Last night I slept in my childhood bed for the first time in months. I was falling asleep on my stomach when I realised I'm heading towards SP. It happened four or five times in a row because I was too disoriented to immediately change position after getting out of it. For some reason, my mouth was open the entire time and I can feel drool trickling out as I lay there motionless lol. But I was finally able to break the cycle and moved to my side, and I slept like a baby after that.",1
is it normal to only get episodes when I have unsettling dreams?,"so, when I was about 6-7 years old I had my first episode. I had a really unsettling nightmare about getting bit by a snake and dying on the spot after telling someone. I got really scared so I tried to alert my mom (we were on vacation so we were sleeping together) and she noticed.

now, last night I had my second episode. this time I was calmer since I had no idea what was going on because I was having a weird ass dream. on the side, I don't have sleep paralysis demons and I feel like it's weird, is this normal?",1
Dying every night while I sleep because of PTSD from tripping,"After having a very intense ego death on psychedelics, every time I try to sleep I now have sleep paralysis. Since my brain can’t come to terms with being paralyzed, it makes up a dream to understand this phenomenon. In the dream I always die, and have to remember to be alive in order to wake up. I told my psychiatrist what was going on and she prescribed me Prazosin for the nightmares. I’ve been on it for about 2 weeks and so far it’s done nothing but help me forget my dreams. But the problem with forgetting them is that I’m now having flashbacks to the dreams during the day. Does anyone have any advice on what to do to make the sleep paralysis dreams easier to manage? Anything helps.",1
Worst one yet,"I’ve suffered from sleep paralysis for about 5 years but I experienced the worst episode yet last night. 

Normally, the setting of my sleep paralysis dream is just in the room I’m in, but this time I was dreaming of being in a vacation home with my parents. The dream started pretty normally. We were just settling into the house and when it was time to sleep, it turned for the worse. There was a dark presence and I almost recognized instantly that I was dreaming. I screamed bloody murder for help and that did nothing. I told myself over and over, “this isn’t real” but that’s when it got violent.

The dark presence pulled me to the ground off my bed and dragged me. The part that stood out to me the most was this cold feeling spreading over the back of my head to the top, like my head was bleeding. It was so cold and felt so real. I’m getting goosebumps and a little teary eyed thinking about it. 

This time, I really felt like I was dying and that this was hell. I was beginning to accept that I was dead. It was taking too long to wake up, so I was certain this was it.
I tried to steady my breathing but it wasn’t helping. So I hyperventilated and woke up finally. Drenched in sweat. I actually didn’t cry when I woke up. I was unable to comprehend what happened until later.",1
i think i had sleep paralysis last night.,"it was seven o'clock and i was really tired so i went to sleep and woke up 4 hours after, i thought my sleep was round so i tried to go to sleep, then i was in a dream and suddenly i saw a man in a corner and i was lying down tried to move my hand but i couldn't it felt like pins and needles,but i could close my eyes,i felt intense pressure and anxiety the way you feel on a roller coaster and it went away after a few seconds an then i woke up. Is this actual sleep paralysis and will it happen again?",1
"Sleep Possession, Paralysis or Psychosis?","I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but something very scary happened to me last night.

I went to sleep at around 10 PM as usual, and I woke up at 3:33 AM exactly as I checked my phone, as you do. I then went back to sleep straight after but then I woke up yet again and I looked at the time and it was still 3:33, but I thought I had just had some sleep. That's when the shadow came.

There was a dark, almost demonic figure in my head that was thrashing around going crazy. There was no sound and it had no face, but it just kept shaking itself from side to side viciously, as if it had something on it it was trying to shake off. It all got too real for me and after what felt like hours, I texted a friend of mine at 3:35, only two minutes since it began.

I somehow finally got back to sleep and had a weird dream but that's normal for me, and I woke up at around 8 but I felt like I had a concussion or something. I went to the bathroom and I looked at myself and I honestly couldn't recognise myself. I usually have quite a happy demeanour, but right now I can barely smile, I'm really confused and I still have a headache.

I should also mention that I have a history of acute psychotic episodes and various mental health issues but in my 22 years, I've experienced nothing like this.

Do I need to contact a Priest or a psychiatrist?

Thank you all for your help.",1
Last night's was different,"So, I regularly experience sleep paralysis. Maybe once a month, which I guess might not seem regular to some but will to others?
Anyway, normally my experience is always the same, i wake but can't move or make any sound. And the shadow figure is always either stood in the doorway or at the foot of my bed watching me. Usually I recognise what's happening and can just ride it out, controlling my panic with deep breathing until it lifts and I can move.
But last night was a totally new and seriously scary experience. It started with a dream about walking into a sort of walk-in closet and bumping into what I thought was my friend who started laughing at me. Then everything changed, the background fell away and my friend sort of morphed into the shadow figure as the walls of the closet were replaced with the walls of my bedroom. This I presume was me 'waking'.
But this time instead of being at the foot of my bed, the shadow figure was stood right beside me and started to press down on my right shoulder (I should add I was sleeping on my left side facing my wife)
I could see it behind me and feel the pressure increase on my shoulder and chest. I couldn't breathe and I absolutely fucking panicked. Instead of  doing my usual calm breathing I went into full panic mode and tried desperately to yell or poke/prod my wife to 'wake' me and get rid of it. It felt like I was being crushed by an immense weight which is one of my biggest fears hence the absolute panic and absence of clear thinking.
Eventually it eased off and it felt like I was pushing through ever thinning mud or something as my muscles started to finally respond and I could sit up.
I'm not normally bothered by these experiences but the complete sweve of behaviour from my shadow figure has me a bit rattled.
Anyway I thought I'd share this particular incident with ya'll just because of the change in narrative.

Sleep well folks.",1
SP worsens with more stress than usual? Stop breathing during SP?,"I had a bout of sleep paralysis last night and after waking in my usual panic attack, it dawned on me that my episodes happen every time I'm stressed out more than usual. I have several mental and physical issues that keep me stressed constantly but it's only when more stress is stacked on top of that that my SP increases. I also find my other sleep issues increasing during very trying times. Does anyone else have this experience.

Also, during SP, not only can't I move or speak, but I can't breathe. My last severe episode, I was face down in a pile of pillows, unable to move or breathe, yet I was conscious that I couldn't. I knew that if I didn't breathe soon, I was in danger of suffocating, heightening my panic since suffocating is the biggest phobia I have. Anyway, I just wanted to know if anybody experiences the inability to breathe during their episodes.",1
Weird experience x 2,"I have never had sleep paralysis before, or at least nothing like this that I can think of...

Twice now I have had a dream (these have been during middle of the day naps) where I wake up in the dream and half of my face is paralyzed and I can’t see... the only thing I can see is a fixed vision. I can’t remember what it was last time, but this time it was my bedroom wall and window... which is the way that I was facing so it is possible that my eyes were open. 

I am still dreaming though, so I keep trying to reach for my phone to call someone and it’s like I can not see my phone screen. I move it in and out of my field of vision but I can not see it. 

And I also am trying to wake myself up through this, knowing it’s a dream. In the dream I kept screaming for my daughter to come help me because I clearly couldn’t see and couldn’t move... 

When I finally come out of these it’s a feeling of “thank god it’s over” but also still feel very panicked. 

What do you think?",1
I thought I was dying last night,"I get very frequent SP, but last night's episode was different than anything I had experienced in the past.

I sleep on my stomach to avoid sp. last night I woke up not being able to breath. I got tested for covid yesterday too, so before my brain even REGISTERED that I was in sleep paralysis, I felt a terror that I haven't felt since my first couple of episodes years ago. I couldn't breath, and it felt like my lungs were completely constricted. It felt like I was trying to gasp for breath through a coffee straw. When I snapped out it, I was able to breathe again. I'm a dumbass and had the same type of episode 2-3 more times because I went back to sleep without totally waking up. If I get sp, usually I get it back to back.

I honestly cannot describe how scary it was. I have seen monsters, I have felt the sensation of free falling, i've felt hands, i've heard screaming... I thought I had seen the worst of it, but this was different. When I woke up, I didn't even KNOW I was in SP. I tried yelling for help, but I couldn't breathe. I was just laying there fully expecting to black out and die last night. It was extremely upsetting.",1
Progressively getting worse,First my arms would just freeze up and I could move my head.. then The next day I couldn’t move ANYTHING... last night I literally felt an entity pulling my shits off super fast.. is this normal,1
Terrifying SP experience. All of my senses sort of short circuited. Anyone else have this?,"Asleep in my bed I seemingly wake up from an odd smell, a sort of disgustingly sweet mens cologne, nothing I had smelled before. I thought I heard footsteps and peek at the cracked open doorway. That's when I realize I can't move and initially I thought I was paralyzed by dear because it definitely sounded like someone was behind the door, creeping into the room. I could hear footsteps and see a shadowy figure approaching. I try to scream and wake my bf up who is next to me but nothing. I see the shadowy figure directly next to me and I think omg omg. He reaches for me and I feel the crushing sensation and all of a sudden my vision goes completely black and my ears deaf. Like everything violently turned off..eyes, ears, smell, touch, everything... I figured I was dying and thought to myself just let it happen, this is how I die, nothing I can do. Then I hear this inexplicable screaming in my head. Like a thousand voices, high and low, not of my own, screaming at once. 

After what feels like 10 mins but is ultimately seconds I am able to move again and immediately start hyperventilating. My Fitbit is recording my HR at 120 and my freaked out bf tries to calm me down. My overwhelming sense of a presence in the room does not go away and I'm stuck unable to sleep and essentially lay there crying and shaking all night. 

I've only had sleep paralysis and night terrors maybe once or twice in my life but nothing even close to this experience. This one rocked my world and will inevitably haunt me forever. I'm rather spiritual and also an empath so I'm not sure if this charge of energy perception has something to do with my experience but I just wanted to post this and see if anyone else has had these olfactory or auditory hallucinations? Like all my senses short circuited at once.",1
Lucid dream then sleep paralysis,"This morning I woke at around 6:30am with about 4 and a half hours of sleep, I got up for breakfast at about 8:30am then went back into bed and fell asleep at 9:30am. I don’t know if any of that matters but anyway ahaha. I started lucid dreaming, not being able to control my dream but still partly being awake and conscious while dreaming but not fully awake. The lucid dream was very confusing, but it then turned into sleep paralysis. A spider about 15cm in width and length was crawling on my ceiling. I remember feeling intense stress and just not feeling relaxed at all. This all happened in the space of 30-40 mins. Wondered if anyone has experienced anything like this or if anyone has any tips or whatever.",1
My First Ever Sleep Paralysis Experience,"I should start by saying I’ve probably only had sleep paralysis about 5 or 6 times in my life but the first one will always stick with me.  It was how I first learned what SP was because I was so convinced that I had just had a supernatural experience with some kind of entity that I went to tell a friend what had happened and he told me that it was probably just SP.  I had never heard of it beforehand. 

Anyways about 12 years ago I was living in Boston and had gotten into a fight with my ex at the time. Needless to say I was sleeping downstairs on the couch.  I can’t remember if I was already asleep or if I was falling asleep but all of the sudden I heard a soft whisper in my ear...”Hey.”  I could feel the breathe in my ear and I opened my eyes startled.  I laid there motionless wondering if there was an intruder in the house until I realized if that were the case they probably wouldn’t have tried to wake me up.  I could feel someone standing over me behind the couch and the energy in the room was very heavy and negative.  This is when I realized I was in a bad situation.  I didn’t know what was behind me but I could feel it’s presence and knew it was malevolent.  At this point I thought to myself “ok I’ll just play dead and act like I’m still asleep. Whatever is behind me doesn’t even know I’m awake.”  And so I laid there for a few more seconds (which felt much longer) until I realized whatever was behind me wasn’t going to leave.  I decided I had no choice but to face it head on so I said “fuck it I’m going to turn around and deal with whatever is there”.  This is when the whole ordeal took a weird/terrifying turn.  I was on my side and started to spin around and the moment I did I felt a hand grab onto the back of my neck.  It was so violent, hostile and strong that the first thing I thought was “what is this????”  I’ll never forget that thought shooting across my mind.  It was like I suddenly realized I was completely out of my element and whatever had a hold of me was something bigger than I had ever known.  My body was shaking and I felt this pulse running through me.  I tried to scream but, of course, could not and then all of the sudden *poof* it let go....I was awake sitting up and alone in the living room. The hair on my arms was standing up and I was terrified.  I was convinced I had just been attacked by some spirit because I had no idea what SP was back in 2008.   Like I said I’ve had it happen a few more times over the years but nothing as impactful as that.  I’ll never forget it.",1
How I prevented and cured Sleep paralysis,"I had experiences with SP twice and it was scary to watch the shadows in human form move, but now I don’t have that problem because I pray to Jesus Christ every night before bed and he does it.

Before you say  you are stupid that is fake,give it a try  . Everytime when you are in trouble(not just only when you have SP) pray to Jesus and say God please help me in your mind . Use your own words from your heart  and head  and read The Bible  as much as you can . This is what helped me to cure SP and prevent it in future.I hope it will help you as much it does to me.

Something different.,"I have been experiencing something different from your general sleep paralysis. At this point, I am unsure if it's even sleep paralysis. I have posted about this some time ago but only 1 person replied and it didn't help me identify it.

So it goes like this. I wake up. Try to stand up and feel the ground with my feet and the bed with my hands and bum. But my vision is set in stone. Even if I move around my vision is the same thing. The wall that I was looking at when I woke up. It might sound a bit confusing but imagine you are blind but instead of seeing nothing, you see the last frame that your eyes have seen. Ugh... I am unable to explain this but if anyone knows what it is please comment.",1
Sleep paralysis at 3:30 (Anyone Else?),"I’m 18 years old and I live with my grandma, auntie, and older cousin. I was sleeping with all of the lights off inside the house and it was quiet. I fell asleep with my window opened, and on my back. Literally at 3:30am I felt like I woke up but I couldn’t move or talk. It just felt weird, like my body felt weird or it felt fuzzy. I knew exactly what was happening because I’ve had sleep paralysis once before so I tried to remain calm and not panic. It’s up until the point where I heard noises from outside my window and I heard a little girl or a kid crying out in the living room and that’s where I tried so hard to move but I couldn’t. I tried so hard just to move my fingers or my arms but couldn’t. It was until I took a deep breath and I forced myself to sit up as fast as I could and I felt like something was off in my room. So I immediately locked both doors of my house, turned on the lights and had my best friend come over. It is a reminder why I never like sleeping on my back, for that reason. This happened about an hour ago and it is currently 4:18am. I’m going to try to go to bed again, it’s just I didn’t like how I woke up at 3:30am. Has anybody else had sleep paralysis around 3am and have a little girl or hear noises?",1
Sounds gets 200% or more higher in sleep paralysis,"Hello, everybody. 

I have SP since i'm 11 or 12, today i'm 21 and still have this about 3 or 4 times a week. I always noticed that when I get stuck in sleep paralysis the sound gets 200% higher most of times driving me crazy. 

For example, one day I was sleeping on the couch watching to Dragonforce Live show, I fell asleep and got stucked in a sleep paralysis. The TV sound was normal, but at SP the sound was 1000% higher in my head, i felt so bad about it. Today, i was taking a nap when i got stucked and had one like this. It hurts my head everytime. 

Does anybody have the same problems?",1
Does anyone expierence this too?!,"I had SP this morning and thought nothing of it. When i woke up, i thought i heard my mom and my little brother laughing in the background, so I just went back to sleep. When I closed my eyes, i was talking to my deceased Grandpa and he was telling me, to tell my mom that everything is ok here. And every question I asked or he answered, I felt a heavy press on my body. First my chest, legs, arms and then face. I then woke up in straight panic not being able to move. I tried calling for my mom to help me but only whispers came out. When I snapped out, my face was numb and so was my body, I also was experiencing a tingling in my face as if I woke up in the middle of the night dehydrated. And I later found out my brother wasn't even awake yet. Who knows, I could've been the demon's talking. Please leave a comment if you experienced a hallucination like that, or felt pressure on your face too.

I think I had my first Sleep Paralysis Experience last night.,"Okay, so I don’t know if this was sleep paralysis or not, but from what I’ve seen I’m pretty sure it was. So I was having this weird dream (like any normal night) where I’m talking to this guy on a rooftop, then suddenly we’re in an old abandoned house. When I say abandoned, I mean it’s rotten wood everywhere windows busted out, that kind of abandoned. Then all of the sudden, the guy is gone and there is this little girl standing there. She turns around and she has these black holes where her eyes and mouth should be. Her skin is dry and cracked like she’s been dried out for years. I forget what she said, but she starts asking questions and insulting me. I went to go say “Fuck You Bitch!” but as I did, all of the sudden I’m in my bed laying there. I’m on my back looking at the foot of my bed and there is these two tall, skinny black figures standing at the foot of my bed. I’m trying to yell, punch, kick, anything but I can’t move and all I hear is the figures chanting “Fuck You Bitch!” All of the sudden, the entire room starts shaking and my vision gets all fuzzy and wobbly and the chants get louder and turned into shrieks. All of the sudden I woke up punching, kicking, and yelling. I was able to finally calm down (thanks to my dog being concerned for me and coming over to me) and went back to sleep, but that’s my sleep paralysis story.",1

Is it weird?,"Is it weird that I enjoy sleep paralysis? Sometimes I just try to wake up in the middle of the night just to experience another SP. Although it is kinda scary, I like it and I look forward to every SP. I think of it as something new, something I can't experience in my everyday life",1
I’m glad I listen to metal,I’ve had a couple of spe when I was like 8 but when i started listening to metal i for some reason stopped having sleep paralysis. Can anyone explain this.,1
strange sleep paralysis experience,"so yesterday i had a strange sp experience... i remember the tail end of my dream before i woke up. i was in a room, it kinda felt cozy and lived in with a warm lamp light lighting the room... there was a closet at the end of it.... i cant recall every being in this room before... my back was turned towards the closet, i was talking about something (cant recall what it was about or if i was talking to some one else in the room) and then suddenly i sensed a presence behind me coming from the closet. it apperently sense my awareness and tried to flee but i reach out as it pass me and was some how able to wrap my arms around it in a bear hug... it was desperately trying to wriggle out of my grasp and the movements seemed to slow wake me up. it was like a slow transition from dream to reality that blended from one into the other. first thing i noticed was the presence right right next to my head... it felt exactly like the presence in the dream. and i was lying on my bacck with my arms hugging my crossing each other around the right side of my chest. i swear i could feel that i was hugging something to myself... i tried to move but i couldnt budge... i could hear a sort of faint wooshing (or white noise) sound right next to my right ear ... i assumed it was coming from what ever i was hugging... it was beginning to frighten me... i tried to scream... nothing came out at first but i could feel it welling up inside of me before it burst out and i could suddenly move again... the entity i was hugging was gone too... it was so strange.

The worst sp experience I’ve had.,"I’m sleeping on my right side right and suddenly it becomes hard to breathe, when I’m sleeping on my right side and happen to be looking at my phone then it starts.

First it’s the voices the whispering ones they aren’t saying anything that I can understand and they’re fast and frequent it’s like a thousand people talking to me at once.

Then it was a furry claw I felt something or someone come behind me but I couldn’t turn around I could only use my vision by looking to the side of me was a furry claw that placed itself on my shoulder I didn’t know what it was because I couldn’t see it

At this point I’m freaking the hell out and then the worst of the worst happens.

You realize that I was looking at my phone right ? All of a sudden a message comes up with three words 666 and the message just kept spamming “Let me talk to you, Let me talk to you, Let me talk to you”

I gained control of my body and everything was normal again it was still creepy ash",1
Sleep Paralysis or something different???,"I haven’t had sleep paralysis in a few months and tonights experience was different from what i’m used to. Questioning if it was SP at all. When I woke up it definitely had the same vibe as when I get SP I couldn’t really move or speak and I was immediately scared. I usually keep my eyes closed when I get it to avoid seeing anything that’s not really there, but this time I kept them open but my vision was still blocked off.. It was really strange i could see certain areas of my room but when i looked in others it would just be blank... what freaked me out is that I felt like there was someone in my room and I would only lose my vision when I would look in the direction I thought they were in.. and i wouldn’t fully lose my vision bc i could still recognize my room around me from my peripheral but i couldn’t see what was right in front of me. To clarify my closet is right across my bed and the doors were open and the light was on so I could clearly see around my room it wasn’t pitch black or anything. I started screaming hard, but of course that didn’t matter as nothing really came out although I could hear the screams in my ears like when you’re under water so I wondered if maybe something, anything was coming out. I kept screaming and looking around and eventually I gained the ability to move my arms and started banging them on the wall behind me hoping my roommate might wake up and come get me out of this but nothing. It goes on i’m screaming trying to move and break out of this and i feel like my roommate came in I can sense someone standing by my door and the figure vaguely resembles her from out the corner of my eyes but I can’t see her when I looked in her direction it’s blocked out. Still i felt like it was her and i think finally she heard me and came to help but they are just standing there and again any time i tried to look at her I couldn’t see so im just screaming for help and telling her “i can’t see i can’t see” which is weird bc usually you can’t talk but it felt like the words were actually coming out but i can’t know for sure bc my sense are all messed up and i don’t know what the believe. But if i was actually making any noise im sure my roommate actually would have ran in freaking out. But anyway this figure i perceived to be her never moves it just stays there, i’m never able to really see them and I realize it probably isn’t her. Eventually I am able to move a bit more and i’m getting ready to try and fall out of my bed hoping that’ll end this but then BAM the minute I turn over i see something (someone?) right in front of my face and before im able to process what it was i’m out of it. I immediately sit up, let out another scream and calmed down. One of the first things I usually do when I get out of SP is get on my phone and of course it was 3:30 am... and even weirder earlier in the night around 10pm I was in and out of sleep on the couch with my roommate and heard a loud sigh and it sounded like it said something but it was really distorted and I couldn’t make it out. I don’t know it really freaked me out and I considered waking up my roommate and telling her about it but I didn’t want to freak her out so I kept it to myself but after that I just felt very weird and I just knew I was gonna get SP or something tonight. I’m a pretty spiritual person and although i’m used to getting sleep paralysis this just felt weird, i’ve never had as much movement available to me during an episode as i did tonight.. i was able to  bang my fists on the wall behind me even tho it felt like in a dream where it felt slower and weaker but regardless i was doing it but i couldn’t move enough to get out of bed?? and i’ve never experienced vision problems like this..losing it only at certain times basically only unable to see what I was trying to look at but still seeing the room around it. Idk just wanted to share the experience because now i can’t sleep and i’m still trying to work through it. I’m a pretty spiritual person so if anyone has any advice or theories about the experience or just want to share something similar please do.",1
"Nightmare, dehydration?","Last night was very hot and humid. I had a single sheet on the bed. It took ages to fall asleep and when i did, i had the worst nightmare/paralysis ive had for a while. There was something literally dragging me off my bed. I could feel myself holding onto the pillow and sheets, and the figure doing this to me was stood at the bottom of the bed pulling me by my ankles. In my dream, i tried to wake up but was unable to, i tried several times and felt at one point like i was stuck, and wasnt going to wake up.

This has literally terrified me. Im scared of going to sleep tonight. One thing i have noticed, is if i dont drink enough water before bed, these tend to happen more often than not. Obviously the flipside, is that you may have to get up and pee 😂 but id take that, over being dragged out of my bed by an unknown sleep entity anyday of the week.",1
"Weird SP, anyone experienced this?","Hi everyone, it’s currently 12:30 am and had a couple of (what I believe is) sleep paralysis. It happens when I’m falling asleep. Never when waking up. Anyone else have this? Also what’s weird is I can move. I’ve like scratched/hit my face to try to wake up (unless I’m dreaming this?) but never manage to wake up from this. Also something else that’s creepy that doesn’t happen as often- i feel like I float up in the air or that I’m going to roll off my bed - like I’m getting pushed. Ive woken up with a foot on the floor when I’m about to actually fall down. Just weird stuff. Anyone else experience similar things?",1
Sexual Sleep Paralysis,"So just curious if others experience this form of sleep paralysis ?
I don’t experience sleep paralysis too often but when I do it’s always the same . At first the early memories of my sleep paralysis were much more scary as most of the time it felt like I was either being “kidnapped” , as in the feeling of being carried  , or a feeling of being raped almost .I feel like as I started getting more used to identifying that I was in sleep paralysis it changed , so now it’s always a very sexual experience . Horrible to say but it’s like pleasurable now ? Its like I can feel all the sensation and weight on my body of these sexual experiences . But this last time was particularly interesting because , I realized I was in sleep paralysis and started controlling the sexual “acts” if you will that were happening to me . 

It’s really bizarre .",1
Is it bad to have chronic sleep paralysis (maybe once every two weeks or so),"I have been having almost bi-weekly bouts of sleep paralysis since maybe around 2016. It has gotten to the point now that I don't even get stressed or scared when it happens, but it always annoys me to no end.

I used to do the finger wiggle trick and stuff to wake myself up, but now when I try to do it my brain seems to just ""dream"" that I wiggled my fingers and toes, so I don't actually wiggle them, so it takes me much longer to actually wake myself up. I tried forcing myself to hyperventilate to trick myself into waking up as well, but that started giving me anxiety when it took too long to wake me up so I don't do that anymore.

Is it unhealthy for me long term? I'm worried I might have some sort of disorder. I am skeptical about seeing a specialist since it happens to me on an unpredictable schedule, so when they do the sleep testing on me I might not even get sleep paralysis. Especially if I'm sleeping in an unfamiliar environment, my brain might just not decide to go into sleep paralysis mode. If there any any real long term health effects, then I don't mind dealing with the annoyance, especially if I have to pay a lot of medical bills just to figure out whats going on.",1
Was this sleep paralysis or did I dream about sleep paralysis ?,"I've had sleep paralysis once before this one. In the first one I had, towards the end of it, someone with a blue sweater came up behind me in my bed and held me and kept telling me ""just hang on tight!"" He repeated it over and over until I woke up. It was more comforting than demonic, which is weird lol. But last night, a very dark figure came through my door and held me down and I screamed, but nothing came out. The dark figure disappeared and I heard/felt someone climbing into my bed behind me again. I was so scared to turn around to see what I was about to face. But I did, and it turned out to be an old co-worker of mine. It was completely random and we ended up just chatting and the dream continued into something else. Was this sleep paralysis ? Or did I just dream about sleep paralysis ? Does sleep paralysis happen then turn into a regular dream without waking up first ?",1
Has anyone else experienced this? / Does anybody know what this is?,"I’ve had sleep paralysis every now and then since I was a kid, but recently i’ve been having the same type of “Sleep Paralysis” every night. The experience itself only lasts 10 - 20 seconds and isn’t nearly as scary as normal SP, and at some point it was starting to be annoying rather than scary. So i’m strictly here to find out if this is SP or not. I’ll describe the experience here: I can barely twitch my fingers, and if I try to scream, the most I can get out of my mouth is a quiet “ah”. My vision is blurry and there is hallucinations, but the most consistent thing through all of the experiences, is that there is always some loud noise that I hear, almost like someone blowing into a microphone. I’ve tried to look this up but i’m getting nowhere. If anyone has experienced the same thing and knows what this is, i’d really appreciate if you helped me out.",1
Does anyone know what this is?,"Okay, so, this hasn't happened in a couple of years until now, but I got it this morning;

Sometimes, I get something that feels like sleep paralysis, except I can feel myself move. I can perceive the things around me, and my eyes/visual perception, at least, are unable to move, but the rest of my body isn't stuck or weighed down. I can even feel my head move freely, but everything I see is as if I were in sleep paralysis, not moving.

I've experienced this more often than traditional SP, and I wanted to see if anyone's heard of this. I'm not sure how related this is to SP- maybe it has more to do with astral projection?- but if anyone has any insight, I'd greatly appreciate it!",1
Does anyone else fly through space during sleep paralysis?,"Last night I woke up asleep I heard the buzz again and I was like ""ah here we go again"". I don't really get scared anymore so im just laying there waiting for it to be over. Then I shot out of my body and was zipping through space with out a body I could see the Milky Way galaxy, stars and planets were whizzing past means from a distance I saw a wall of yellow structures and I flew right in to it. These structures were all around me flying by. I couldn't make out what they were but I made it to the end then I flew in to another wall that seemed to be a different dimension I couldn't tell what I was looking at. everything looked like green line art on black. I flew out of that and in to another thing I don't know if they are dimensions universes or what but I was trying to focus on objects but I only saw pixels. Maybe it was too much for my human mind to perceive. Before I knew it I was in a vehicle with three other beings. Like aliens or something. I had a body this time so I put my hand on this things humanoid shoulder to see if I could and it just turned its head and looked at me and finally I flew really really fast in to a light and finally woke up. This has happened to me a few times before sometimes im just flying through a tunnel or floating around in my room. Sorry this is so long but I just wanted to know if anyone has experience this before.",1
Does melatonin make anybody’s sleep paralysis worse?,"I experience sleep paralysis pretty regularly anyway, but I took melatonin the past two nights and both nights I experienced it more intensely and multiple times each night. I also woke up grinding my teeth the second night, and I had some weird dreams. Has anybody else experienced anything like this after taking melatonin?",1
Do you guys also have extremely realistic dreams amidst sp?,"What I mean is do you also drift in and out of full-on dreaming while experiencing sleep paralysis?

For example, I once saw a bat flying around my room while experiencing sleep paralysis. For quite some time I tried to move but couldn't. Then suddenly I could and I grapped the bat. Then I lay back down in my bed with the bat still in my closed hand. When in my bed I automatically returned to the same position as I was lying in before and I was stuck again but now with a bat in my hand. After stressing about the bat for a while I realized it was a dream, yet I was still in sleep paralysis for a bit.

Another example is that once I was trying to break out of sleep paralysis and I succeeded! I immediately walked out of my bedroom and into the living room feeling relieved. When I entered the living room I noticed a leather couch. I realised we don't have a leather couch and at once I was back in my bed in the same position I had been stuck in before. It was like when you reset a level in a videogame and go back to your last save.",1
That “sitting” feeling...,"I’ve had zero SP incidents for a while (I’ve experienced them since early teens), then four last night. I had woken up around one and noticed Ring alerts on my phone and realized that my husband had left around 9 pm, around the time I went to bed. I don’t know if him going out just triggered some stress or fear, but as soon as I dozed back off, it all started.

First one, I was drifting back to sleep and it felt like someone sat down on the edge of the bed, right against by back. I felt the mattress move and felt a little pressure against my back and I thought it must have been the husband. Then I realized I couldn’t move or react at all and I started trying to wake myself up by attempting to move my arms/hands and making noise. Finally snapped out of it.

It took me a while, but I started dozing off again and I felt the bed shake a little, the way it does when my dog is scratching himself. I woke up out of that easily, so I don’t know if that qualifies.

The third was a dream I can’t remember was upsetting, so I started trying to wake myself up. Finally got my eyes open a little and saw the bedroom wall but everything looked glitchy and kind of staticy and pixelated. Struggled again to move and wake myself up.

The third one I don’t remember, but I know I was trying desperately to move my arms and make sounds. 

What IS that sitting feeling? Not the classic sensation of something on your chest, but literally feeling the bed move. That scares me more than anything because I FEEL IT. Through all of these I just by default had that feeling of a presence that I think just comes with the helplessness and fear, but how do we physically feel things that aren’t there? Is there truly nothing there? 

My husband is going out of town for the next two nights and I’m honestly nervous about sleeping alone. I’ve been slightly off all day and I just don’t want it to spill over into tonight. Any exercises or tips on how to get past those horrible feelings from last night?",1
My Friend called this a 'Waking Nightmare',"Almost 2 years ago on the 17/9/2018 i had experienced something that i find hard to explain even now. I wrote what happened down shortly after i woke up that night in as much detail as i could and now id like to share this experience.

&#x200B;

I had this 'dream' and i could physically see this silhouette of what looked alot like me, i had full control of myself and could move as freely as i wanted to but when i took the opportunity to try and forcefully touch the silhouette some kind of force wasn't letting me have any kind of interaction with 'myself' (the silhouette), But when i tried a calmer and more soft approach i was able to interact with this silhouette.

A short second later and i could feel something alot like my subconscious telling me to tackle this silhouette and the moment i committed and decided to tackle the silhouette everything changed back to normal and i could see my room again. Assuming that i had woken up i wrapped myself up in my duvet and closed my eyes or so i thought because now they where open and all i could see in front of me was this big hedge with a concrete path in front of it, And yet i could still see that i was in my room but not in my bed.

I turned around and again everything flips im suddenly laid down on this concrete pathway and i can see the silhouette sinking into the ground right in front of me and as the silhouette is sinking i decide to try and physically harm (kick/punch) it and just as before i cannot do anything harmful or forced to this silhouette.

About a second or two later and this thing comes back out of the floor but not as the silhouette that i saw it as before, it looked exactly like me but it had the textural appearance of a gargoyle and again just as before i start to try to physically harm this thing in front of me but now im able to and im yelling/screaming at this thing whilst im attacking it.

But again like another switch i go from attacking to now trying to help this thing out of the ground and whilst im pulling \*bam\* im back to reality, I wake up in bed screaming in agony because i can just feel this incredible pain in my leg that felt like it was going to snap/break,the pain then disappears and for a good couple seconds my heart and neck is hurting and i have a massive shortness of breath aswell as a cold presence on me.

After that as you could imagine i started crying and was utterly terrified to even think of going back to sleep.

(i split this up so it wasn't a cluttered mess to read, if anyone knows if this really was a Waking Nightmare please let me know, also I've not experienced anything like this since it happened but its still so vivid and  in my mind and im trying to figure out the reasoning behind as to why i had this experience)",1
The entity,"I'm curious to hear about your guys experiences if you have ever seen an entity or 'sleep paralysis demon'. I have seen one once and am interested in comparing the similarities between mine and others. Before having this experience I would also like to note I had never seen or heard anything about the phenomenon, it just came out of the blue. Mine laid next to me on my bed, limp like a ragdoll. It was light flesh color, had small black beady eyes, long oval alien like face, thin hair, and a huge teeth grin that took up most its face. It just laid there staring at me motionless while I laid there unable to move. I'm very interested if anyone has seen something similar or what they have seen.",1
Plz inform,Why did the sleep paralysis demon tell me to kill myself like I was just tryin to nap,1
Is it time for me to seek a sleep specialist?,"I've posted and commented quite a bit in this sub; this will not be another ""is the SP' post. 

Since posting in here my episodes subsided- however, in the last month I've had probably the worst string of nights since I developed SP. Not only have my episodes been more frequent, they are accompanied by exhausting lucid dreams and now hypnogogic hallucinations. 

I've become deflated during the days after these nights. I can feel the physiological stress and have started to fear falling asleep. I'm wondering if it's time I seek a medical professional (found a psychiatrist who specializes in sleep medicine in my network), as I do not know what else to do. 

It is really shocking that most of what you find on our \*dissorder\*? is purely research. Wondering anyone and everyone's thoughts.

Thank you.",1

my first experience with sleep paralysis,"I’ve been on reddit for quite sometime just to read cool stories and such. I’m really into all the lucid dreaming and all the scary stories and AP... I’m only 14 and I find it all interesting and I’ve always wanted to try and lucid dream and astral project but haven’t made any progress lmao. Just a week ago I had surgery to get my appendix removed and I’ve been taking a lot of pain meds so maybe that could has triggered this? also I haven’t been getting much sleep at all because of how much pain I am in. I barely slept last night so I tried to take a nap just 20 min ago.. right when I fell asleep my eyes opened up and I got this huge sensation of numbness that went all down my arms and legs, i was trying to lift my arms but I couldn’t move anything at all... it only lasted a few seconds and then I woke up. I panicked at first but I knew what it was because I’ve read so much about it! I don’t think anybody will read this but worth a shot lmao and if anyone does it’s normal to have the intense numbing sensation right? 
Anyways it was scary but also cool at the same time.. sorry for the terrible writing and grammar I’m not good at that stuff baha",1
Sleep paralysis without seeing anything,"I've only experienced sleep paralysis once in my life. I was laying on my front side as usual, but when it hit, I was somewhat awake and couldn't move. All I could hear was TV static and I felt like something was in my room. I envisioned it to be like a black, floating mass in my head, but I couldn't see it for sure. I broke out of it after a while and woke up at my dad's door (I was like 13 at the time). It was a surreal, creepy experience.

I'm not too knowledgeable about sleep paralysis, but I wanted to know if this is a common occurrence or if anyone went through anything similar to me.",1
Flashing lights during sleep paralysis or retinal issues?,"I have a history of retinal tears. Yesterday I went for a follow up with my retinal doctor who found no issues. This morning I experienced sleep paralysis (haven't had it in 2 months). It lasted for 20 seconds, I was frozen and the left side of my head was slightly pounding and I saw about 20 flashing lights. The night before I only had 4hrs of sleep and have been on high stress levels.

I'm worried about retinal issues however it seems to be one too many flashes to be related plus I saw the eye doctor yesterday. Anyone else experience the same thing with sleep paralysis?",1
its goes like 2-3 times every night,Every night I have the same dream. High pitched sound and I cant move or scream. it happens more than once every night. Any suggestions on what this is called?,1
Controlling sleep paralysis,"Ive had my first SP a year and a half ago
Since my first time I started trying to control it

I go to bed , close my eyes and relax while trying to stay awake.

Ive become quite good at entering sleep paralysis state but its never a good experience as soon as I fall I try to wake up , I panic I try not to but I cant help myself

This morning i woke up early , made myself a cofee , drank it , then i went back to bed to my BF (weird right cofee doesnt hold me from sleeping)

So i was holding my boyfriend’s harm
And I felt i could enter SP at that point I can decide whether or not I fall in SP so I started playing with it , coming close to fall then backing up , as long as I dont fall I dont panic but I have mild hallucination , sound , noise , images and feelings.

This morning it was what my father would feel like if i died , Its hard to explain but , to closest i came to fall the greater the pain was , like if I was feeling what he would feel.

I was playing at the frontier of SP until I tried to get a little bit closer , then i fell , suddently I coulnt get out anymore , I was stuck , those feeling , hallucination became so much stronger , I thought I was crying , then my boyfriend turned on his side and That got me out of it.

Im getting better at entering SP if i could just not panic everytime I wonder how that would feel if instead of beeing a so bad feeling maybe thatd feel good somehow.

Ill keep trying one thing I know is that im better at it then I was.",1
"Anyone else feel themselves move, feel getting pushed back down, start to fight it and get stuck in an endless loop?","I feel like I've been able to move more since it started, like I can fully bring myself up to my arms, usually only to get pushed back down. Today I'm really freaked out since in my last experience I felt as though I fully left my bed, got to the other side of my room, and got forced back again. I can't see very well during this either, when I open them it's in blinks since they're forced shut, but I can hear my tv on in the background perfectly. I can't scream either. Luckily I don't visually hallucinate, although I think my movements are hallucinations. It's been happening for around 5 years now.",1
"Does anyone ""feel"" someone grabbing you or pushing you down when going through SP?","I wrote a whole horror short story based on an experience I had last night where I could actually feel someones hand on my shoulder pushing me down against the bed when I tried to get up.

I know, even vivid dreams can be made realistic with memories, but it still startles me.",1
Hear me out I got a proposal,"Okay so hear me out for a sec bros, how about just before bed you apply one of those sleeping eye masks, or masturbate before bed, add a small led light to the side of ceiling and lastly sleep to your side but facing the wall/bed against a corner too. Anyone done any of these?",1
The most strangest occurrence,"Basically, i felt something on me while the left side of my neck was hurting badly. I assumed it was something giving me a hickey. 

Here's where it gets weirder: I was still sleepy so I didn't bother to check if any marks actually showed up. So instead I must've dreamt or thought of the marks on me because in my next dream, they showed up! 

I hate SP and need to stop sleeping on my back when I'm exhausted. lol",1
Are these known to appear in sleep paralysis?,"I had what I think is sleep paralysis some times.l
Mostly it's just me being unable to move and being scared and for the sake of everything kerping my eyes closed. 😅

But one time I opened my eyes, no reason to do so, and at the foot end of my bed there were Standing three things.
They looked humanoid but with grins that were far to wide and showed pointy teeth. I remember thinking that the bumps in their hair must be horns. 
They seemed to somehow be connected at about the hips. I don't remember their hair color, only they had different ones. 
Then suddenly they swooped over me and I heard them say ""Don't do that again!"" and giggeling. Then they were gone and shortly after I could move. 

I never opened my eyes in sleep paralysis again. I don't think they were even that scary I just don't want to see something really scary.",1
SP after death of a loved one.,"I’m going to be blunt. I found my mother dead last week.....in a very traumatic way. I have regular SP and I am terrified to go to sleep right now. I haven’t really slept since Monday. Exactly a week. I was just starting to use my SP to reach Lucid Dreams. For once I wasn’t scared. But now..... Will she be the figure I see. Will I always see her as the way I found her?  I don’t know. But now I’m going through sleep deprivation, which is a huge trigger for my SP.... if I let myself fall asleep. I saw a therapist who wants me to go on medication to make me sleep. My appt is in a couple hours. I need the medication. She assured me I won’t have dreams on it. But I’m scared. Has anyone else gone through this???",1
Anyone have any tips on how to stop sleep paralysis,"About every other night I get paralyzed but I don’t feel any pressure or hard breathing and usually it’s someone talking to me full conversation I can’t respond. It’s really clear to hear, better than when I’m awake. Then I’m all good and don’t remember a single word.I don’t take any drugs or medicine vitamins, nothing. When this happens scares me enough to have a hard time sleeping and I wake up early for work. Any advise or thoughts",1
Reasons for SP,"So I don’t have much knowledge or background of the causes of sleep paralysis. All I know is I experience it usually because one of the following: I’m on new depression medication and take it too close to bedtime, I’m extremely tired or I’m hungover. Does anyone else get it under one of those circumstances? The first time I experienced it, it was just one episode really. Now when I do, it’s multiple episodes. Every time I try to fall asleep it starts again. I can’t move. I feel like someone might be in my room coming closer to me. I feel pressure on my chest. Sometimes my limbs tingle or shake but I can’t lift them. The worst of it is if it lasts long enough, I start to panic and can’t breathe well. I’d like to hear about anyone else’s experiences. Very few people close to me have experienced this, so I don’t have anyone to talk to who understands.",1

Sleep paralysis within sleep paralysis,"Anyone fall asleep and know you’re in sleep paralysis but when you think you’ve gotten out of it, your still in god damn sleep paralysis.

The most recent ones I've been experiencing are just creepy, but no demons or evil entities lurking about. I see people that I know. My parents, friends and almost always involve a sensation that I'm being lifted from my bed accompanied by a high pitched noise.

If you've been high before, you'll know the feeling. Like your body is being lifted or flying. Ie, high lol. 

Idk, just trying to find someone who might be able to relate.",1
Somehow I stopped an episode as it was starting,"I found this subreddit last year after a particularly frightening episode of SP that made me too afraid to try going back to sleep. I have been experiencing SP for a little over 3 years now, and it's terrifying every single time. 


Last night I was laying in bed on my side (I'm normally a side-sleeper) and started to hear the grinding noise and feel my body tense up. I recognized this feeling and when going into SP have gotten in the habit of trying to move any muscle I can until I'm finally not paralyzed anymore and I know it's over. 


This time however, the first move I made was a kick that I threw all of my energy into, and actually ended up kicking the wall and scaring myself awake, and suddenly the lights snapped on. I didn't realize I had fallen asleep before turning them off, legitimately thought it was dark in the room for those few seconds. I stayed awake watching tv for about an hour to calm down before feeling comfortable to try sleeping again. I've never been able to really stop it before it happens like that, but holy fuck was I relieved that that kick actually worked.",1
SP and astral projection at the same time???,"Ok so I've been dealing with SP for so long now, I can't actually remember when it started, but now almost every time i fall asleep without watching movies/listening to music i go into SP and consciously I'm really okay with it, i know after SP i'm going to fall asleep soon. 
Last night something really weird happened, I felt like something was physically pulling me out of bed slowly and being in SP I knew I couldn't move, but I forced myself to move my hands so I won't fall out of bed, and I felt how my hands moved virtually, astral projection like. 
Anyways I got really frustrated because I was moving virtually but not psysically and all i wanted was to get into a comfortable position and not falling out of my bed, so I did a grounding exercise, i concentrated on feeling my fingertips and I got out of it.

It wasn't scary or threatening because I'm so used to it but it was really weird.

Ever had this happen to you? Does anybody know what actually happened?",1
First agressive contact during sp,"This happened today and was quite unusual. I often use my hands or try to move my fingers to break free from my episodes, this time i napped with my arma crossed and couldnt break free so easily and for the first time i i had ghost hands projecting out of my torso and they went right away wraping around my neck chocking me. My ears often feel a vibration during episodes, Ive heard sounds too, too add to my panic, sounds where of piano notes randomly being hit many times like chaotic simphony and it also sounded like multiple hands playing on the same piano. Sorry for bad english",1
Does this count as sleep paralyses?,"I had dream today, where after a while a black figure appeared in my dream. With a voice calling me on a phone, and threatening me. This all happened very later into the dream. It became a nightmare when the figure started to jumpscare and torture me with fear in my dream. I then woke up, but in reality woke up in a dream room where the figure jumped in front of me and screamed in bloody sirens. I for some reason noticed it was a dream. I then forced myself to wake up again for real, but my body was frozen and i wanted to turn my body but i couldnt. Only after a few seconds i could. I then woke up finally, but with a beating heart and fear. Whilst in the state, i could still hear the figure and see my real room slightly. But in a shade of black and white. I dont know if it counts as sleep paralyses, but i felt as if i couldnt move. It was as if the nightmare didnt want me to leave.",1
2nd experience with sleep paralysis,"The night before last I suffered from the worst of my two cases of sleep paralysis. Or at least I assume this is sleep paralysis.

I was in bed for over an hour, trying to fall asleep. Nothing happened for a long time until my heart started racing. My heart started beating like crazy, and my whole body felt like it was being crushed and started shaking rapidly. My eyes felt like they were being squeezed and my arms were heavy. I felt absolutely terrified. A primal fear, compared to an artificial one. The feeling passed after about 2 minutes, but it felt a lot longer. I was facing the wall next to my bed so I didn't see any apparitions, but it was just as horrifying compared to when I have seen demons.",1
Can anyone tell me what I saw in my trance?,"I had this dream or vision... Not sure if I was just tired, but I did the alchemic meditation that Damien Echols recommends here https://youtu.be/_HOz1y0d0i4 and when I was finished (still a bit conscious) my mind wandered and I saw myself in a very big, white room. You could barely see the tiles but they were still there. There were no decorations on the corners. actually it was completely empty except the middle of the room. In the middle, there was a regular sized square table with a... Person? I'm not sure if you could call it that. Basically was all green and had no specific shape whatsoever. Looked like a rendered human... Kind of like this:

https://images.app.goo.gl/ww1BDaAz3ddPmydw9

There were two chairs, one where he was sitting and other accross the table. Behind him to his right (my left) there was a window were you could see what looked like the night sky with purplish hues and a lot of stars. As I sat down to interact with this person, I remember feeling a bit cautious, even on guard. And as I touched the opposite chair to sit down, his head split in half and the body crumbled, revealing a person with a brownish suit http://imgur.com/a/dVBfSJm like that one but on a more leathery color. Now here is where it gets weird (yep, I know) he had a big spider head (I say spider for lack of imagination to describe it... I would say a middle point between the head of a spider and one of the guys from predator movies). And as I sat down I remember the feeling multiplying, becoming a feeling of dread and just about that moment he started to attack me. He extended from the table and tried to grab me, his mouth opening and revealing huge jaws, trying to take a taste of my face. At that point I felt like I truly fell asleep, but kept seeing in my dream (hope that makes sense). Came to the conclusion that nothing good would come from fighting or being afraid, so I tried  to understand it. What was the reason. Why it was attacking me, how this being actually felt. I know this is going to sound even more weird, but I felt a huge need to understand and befriend this being... As the feeling of dread started to fade, replaced by a feeling of peace, this creature stopped attacking me. Suddenly was sitting in front of me again, hands touching his knees in a formal sitting position. He looked at the window as in innviting me to take a peek. So I stood up and walked towards the window, to take a better look at space or whatever that was. As I started to look outside, a huge flash of light blinded me and suddenly I was back again, feeling really refreshed but tired. Didn't pay it any second thoughts and then fell asleep like a baby.


This was around 2 weeks ago and I've been trying to give it sense since, but to no avail. Sometimes my mind wanders and I'm back in that room, but I either see the human shape or the spider shape just... Sitting there, idle.  Was that a spirit, just my imagination, a demon? I looked at the goetia list and nothing comes close to what I saw, except Buer but looking at the depictions they are still quite different. Am I lossing my mind? Did I see something? Was that just my imagination? The point of why I did that post is to ask you guys How do you guys interpret that because it's been a long time and still can't put my finger on it by myself so now I'm trying to get help from you guys more advanced knowledge.",1
Has anyone ever felt an entity actually within them and/or heard a demonic voice?,"I had my 3rd SP experience 2 nights ago that was so terrifying I am still reeling. The first two that were both years ago and years apart, were just my mind waking up and my body not for what seemed like a minute - it felt like there was a presence in the room, but nothing like what happened to me 2 nights ago...

Our cat passed away Thursday morning and I was pretty sleep deprived from him declining in health all week. I ended up going to sleep on my sofa because I couldn’t get his passing out of my head and was tossing and turning in my bed. I finally fell asleep around 4:30am and woke up close to 5 (I checked the time after this incident).... this SP experience was like I was half in half out of awareness, as I could see my coffee table right in front if me (I was sleeping on my side) but there was a Newton’s cradle on it (this does not exist on my coffee table in real life). The metals balls on it started swinging wildly like something was causing them to move and it’s then that I realized a very dark energy was there and the balls sped up even more while this awful high pitch electric sound was buzzing very loudly in my ears. I couldn’t move, couldn’t scream, couldn’t fully wake up, and then felt this demon like thing inside of me, like it was trying to take my soul 😫 I heard a voice struggle to say “Get out of my body!” but the voice was warbled and demonic. It wasn’t my voice. I was trying to scream for my husband upstairs when my voice was finally able to cause a muffled sound which got me out of it. I sensed a presence around me still and abruptly went back to bedroom, in tears. I did not sleep again that night.

What in the actual fuck. Has anyone ever felt an entity actually within them and/or heard a demonic voice like this?",1
Prevention of sleep paralysis and bad dreams,"hey everyone - I came across this sub-reddit randomly and thought I would share some advice from Islam regarding sleeping. The prophet Muhammad mentioned that whoever recites the verse of the throne aka ayatul kursi(a particular verse in the Quran) before sleeping will be protected from the devil until morning. 

I can honestly say this has worked for me everytime I've tried it. Give it a try and let me know how you get on, play the below audio which has the original Arabic and English translation before going to sleep while in bed.

Is it weird that I kinda enjoy my sleep paralysis?,"So for a while I would experience sleep paralysis several times a week and at least twice a night if they happened. At first I was terrified I would hate the feeling of falling off my bed or feeling like someone was on the other side of me. I remember one time I swear I heard my dad open my door and come in to my room ( my dad was a truck driver and would work odd hours and sometimes come home at around 4am and always check our rooms when he got home) anyways I thought that my dad came in and just laid down in my bed on top of my covers I felt that the sheets were tighter and everything. I couldn’t move but I still wasn’t scared because I was like it’s just dad so I finally convinced my body I was awake and with all my strength I whipped my body to hit my dad because I always fake punch him. But then my arm just landed on my bed not my dad. It was weird and I couldn’t sleep for a while. My other episodes would happen on the couch where I couldn’t move and would hallucinate that I would finally be able to get up and move to my room and it would repeat a bunch until I was finally able to actually get up. I remember crying one time because I was so scared. I experience a lot of different types of episodes where I hear my moms heels in the hallway, knocks on my door, and even random people singing. I don’t hallucinate that much anymore and now I kinda like having sleep paralysis which is probably an unpopular opinion but let me explain. A year and a half ago I was pretty stressed out I had lots of stuff going on with school and work and my grandpa had just died, I was not doing to well. But whenever I would get sleep paralysis my whole body was numb. Everyday I was so tense the whole time just worrying about all the stressors in my life, my head would constantly be throbbing and sometimes I would start hyperventilating just thinking about allllllll the things I had to get done in one day. I loved being numb and having steady breathing and still being awake. I started to just keep hoping that I would get sleep paralysis so that I could feel the sensation of nothingness. Even when I would hear things or see shadowy figures at the end of my bed I didn’t care because at least I wasn’t awake and dealing with the day. I mean really I don’t think I can stress enough how good it feels to me to not feel anything at all when you go through everyday just holding back the tears and maintaining steady breathing. So ever since then whenever I feel my body get heavier and heavier until I can’t move it, I don’t get scared I just let myself relax and enjoy the nothingness.",1
Connection b/w SP & Paranormal?,"I know there’s a lot of debate on whether if SP is just hallucinations or if you’re really experiencing something otherworldly. But do you think SP could be induced by something paranormal as a means to contact you?

A few weeks ago a few friends & I rented a cottage out on a lake. They are super nice & they are pretty old, dated back since the 1950’s. On our last day we moved to a different cottage. It was still nice, had a different feel but i didn’t sense anything particularly weird. I was very sleep deprived all day (which that can trigger an episode) so I went to bed early thinking I’d pass right out until I had the scariest SP to date! I’ve never had this happen before, but as I was falling asleep my breathing started to get shallower and shallower, as well as all of my senses & then my breathing completely stopped & i truly believe my heart stopped beating too. I couldn’t move for a few seconds & then slowly everything started slowly working again. I just brushed it off & tried sleeping again, & it happened again! At that point I got up & started having a panic & anxiety attack b/c I wasn’t sure if I should wake my friends up to take me to the hospital bc I thought my heart was just gonna stop beating again & idk what the f* was happening as I’ve never experienced that before. 

After I calmed myself down I turned on the tv & then after a while I told myself I will try to sleep again. So as I’m falling asleep again I notice my breathing getting heavy & I still just continued to try to sleep & all of a sudden my whole body, head to toe, started to shake uncontrollably. Shaking/vibrating ,, & I didn’t really try to move at that point, I kind of just accepted it... & then to my left there is this little guy standing right next to me, all black from head to toe & then he disappears. & then I look up & there’s a tall man, all in black from head to toe. With black jeans on and shiny black combat boots, standing in the corner. He starts walking towards me slowly and I’m trying to move & scream for help bc I thought it was an actual ghost. I thought I was still in ‘reality’.  I didn’t think I was having a SP episode other than not being able to move bc this was very very real. Usually I mentally know if I’m having SP. and then right as he gets next to me, not knowing wtf is gonna happen next, I snap out of it... then a few mins later my brother comes in cuz he heard me making noises lol!!!! The room was really chilly too. No windows open. Could of meant absolutely nothing though. 

That was the most scary experience to date. Wondering if that cottage has some sort of presence. I never have SP anywhere else.",1
Recent Experience,"I've had many sleep paralysis experiences throughout my life, they're all different and none are alike. This hasn't happened to me in quite a while, a few months maybe. It started calming down when I started practicing witchcraft, so it became less frequent since then.

About a week ago now, I was having an odd dream, it wasn't a nightmare. So within it, I was talking to people (I don't know) and for some reason I turned my head to the right, looking down at the floor. Up until here, everything was calm, it was just odd. I saw a person with grey skin, long black hair and a black dress laying on the floor on their belly, so I couldnt see their face (yet). So I approached slowly because it was like ¿? they came out of nowhere. My dream had nothing to do with them, it was like they interrumpted. When I got close enough, they turned around and jumped on me, that's when I woke up and saw them floating above me with their hair pretty much creating a curtain around my head.

I couldn't move my body, my head was sideways so all I could really do was move my eyes to look up at them and let me tell you; they weren't pretty. I tried screaming but I had no voice, they were just looking down at me with their strange expression. I started making small, weak noises in hopes of someone in the house to be able to hear me because now they were getting closer to my body and it felt like they were applying pressure to my chest, I couldn't breathe.

Eventually, someone did hear me, walked in and turned on the light, that's when I was ""released"". They were gone. That's how it ended and I couldn't get their off of my mind that day so I drew them as a way to let go.",1
What workes for you?,"Hey at the moment i have a lot of time to practice lucid dreaming but when i attempt to do wild i have a problem. Either I just fall asleep or I try to stay concious but when I try to stay concious at some point I think that its not working and i am just wasting my time, then i will get on my side and try to sleep normal. So i am wondering what you guys do and do you have some tips?

PS: Sometimes I get in the hypnotic state where I can hear some random sounds and every now and then I see light in front of my eyes. Also my body tickels sometimes.

And sorry if there is already a question like mine in this subreddit I didn't look all up",1
Sleep Paralysis Animated #3,[https://youtu.be/KIDubGfTjhw](https://youtu.be/KIDubGfTjhw),1
My first experience (today),"This has never happened to me before, I’m 19 and have recently been through a very rough phase of my life with depression and anxiety (which hasn’t fully gone away).

I just remember in my dream feeling this rising sense of panic until I woke up (or I think I woke up - everything seemed really weird like I didn’t know weather I was asleep or not) and when awake all my muscles where super tense and I tried to scream for help but couldn’t because everything was just stiff/frozen my heart started racing and I tried to close my eyes but when I did I just saw my ceiling again, as if my eyes where completely transparent.

Is sleep paralysis serious? Should I be concerned, does it repeat every night?",1
i think i forced sleep paralysis,"I never, ever, ever had any sort of experience with sleep paralysis until like 7 minutes ago. i woke up normally at 4, still tired, went back to sleep and woke up at 6:57. but i didnt wake up naturally. my dream before i woke up was me, eyes closed, in some sort of overflowing bathtub. i unplugged the drain and was still asleep but i knew i was dreaming, so i forced my eyes open. it was so hard to open my eyes i waited 3 seconds then tried with everything and they finally opened. i went to roll over to check my phone but i couldnt move. there was 2 sounds, the highest pitch scream i ever heard and static. when i tried to roll over i didnt move but i could feel my left side get numb as i tried to roll with everything to the right. i tried talking to myself to see if i could speak but i couldnt let out a sound. the static got super loud then i closed my eyes again and woke up and could move. was this actually sleep paralysis?",1
This has been on my mind for 4 years.,"I don't really know where else to post this, so I'll share here. Almost 5 years ago, my grandmother passed away unexpectedly in the apartment we shared when I was 18, and about 4 weeks after her death, I found out I was pregnant. Needless to say, it was overwhelming to have a baby at 18, and handle my grandmothers funeral and the financial stress. 
About 6 weeks after she passed away, I was about 7-8 weeks pregnant, still living in the apartment my grandmother passed away in, I decided to crash on the couch because I was tired. I'll never forget this night bc I honest to God think I experienced sleep paralysis. I woke up, but I felt like I still fully wasn't awake. I couldn't move my body, and I felt this heaviness on my whole chest and stomach. I felt like I was being suffocated. I saw this figure hunched on top of me and it looked exactly like my grandmother, except part of her face was burnt off, like her skin was melted off and all I could feel was this heaviness. I remember panicking and just trying to wake up and I just couldn't I couldn't move. After what felt like forever, I was able to snap out of it and wake up, but I ended up having to stay with my ex for a good week until I felt safe enough to sleep at my apartment again. About 3 weeks later I suffered a miscarriage in my apartment. It's been over 4 years since I had this experience, and since I miscarried, and it weighs heavy on me from time to time. I still see that image of that figure that sat on my chest from time to time. I still kind of struggle with sleeping. Maybe I'm going a little nuts over thinking about the incident, but it just really hasn't sat right with me.",1
5th episode and counting.,"My familiars have been evolving since I was 7. The older I get the more aggressive and violent they get. They never listen to me. 

Once I found myself lying face down into my pillow when I got SP,  felt a great weight on my back as my head sank deeper..tried to call for help but you know the drill: can't move,can't talk. I lay there...talking myself down,trying not to panic.I would have suffocated for sure. I don't know how long it was but it felt like an eternity.

In the latest episode, I woke up to a noise. The room was dark, the noise became louder. Scanned the room, nothing.I was staring at the ceiling when I heard another noise at my door, I turned my eyes to look. Out of the dark crawls a pale looking thing with glowing yellowish red eyes. It leaps on to me and plants its mouth on my chest. In an attempt to rip out my heart I assume. I could feel it pushing down my shoulders,its mouth and warm breath. I tried to pray, however, owing to my little faith that didn't help sh*t. New plan:direct confrontation. Looked it right in the eye and it stopped immediately. It disappeared just as fast as it appeared, the room began to brighten,the sun was still out and shining brightly at that. I rolled out of bed scared and thrilled at the same time.

I try not to sleep on my back but I turn alot in bed and end up landing on it anyway.",1
Someone please help me figure out my condition,"I really dont know what's wrong with me but as of this year every other time I try to nap throughout the day I go into like a binge of sleep paralysis overload every single time I doze off, to the point where I just force myself to stay and wait to get tired at night.

i just had it happen for the first time in months,"i used to get visits from my sleep paralysis demon a lot but i started doing healthier things like going to be early and at the same time and working out a bit. and they stopped for a long time i thought they would just go away but tonight i went to bed late and as i was going to sleep my eyes couldn’t close i saw black and then i saw him. just standing there i wanted to cry, yell, and move to get away, but i couldn’t move and i felt suffocated. i remembered seeing this thing a while back saying to love your toes or fingers and i tried and it finally worked and it was gone. i just got up and went into my moms bed(yeah i find comfort from my mom shhh) and just sat there trying to proses what just happened and tried to sleep. i couldn’t obviously and i got my phone and just distracted myself and here i am.",1
My Sleep Paralysis Trigger,"Just wanted to make a post about it to see if anyone else has identified their trigger.

For me, it's heat. When the room is too hot I definitely get sleep paralysis more. So I get it more often in the summer. I don't take any sleeping pills and I have a regular sleep schedule with around 7-8 hours a night so it's not from exhaustion. I've gotten it while sleeping on my back or on my side. I've had it occasionally all my life so I had a lot of episodes to figure out the trigger.",1
Sleep paralysis is the gateway,If you over come your fear of the demon or whatever it is that your are seeing suffocate you because your lungs are not breathing normally because your sleeping you will then go to the next step which is Astro projection or out of body experience,1
Sleep paralysis episode i had this morning,"last night, i got a little drunk, then when i wanted to go to bed, i took a melatonin. every morning i wake up on and off until i feel like getting up, this morning i woke up and i couldn’t move, i’ve had sleep paralysis before so i wasn’t freaking out that much. i was laying on my back facing the closet, the frame of my closet started to wiggle and vibrate, i also have a hoody hanging and i felt like the hoody was telepathically communicating to me Lol. it felt like the hoody was waiting for me to go back to sleep so i tried to wake myself up out of it, started to panic, and whenever i get into sleep paralysis i try to call my mom, i knew my phone was on my bed so i kept trying to say “hey siri, call mom” but i’m sure it only came out as mumbles, then i remember using my left hand to pick up my phone, the phone screen looked incomprehensible. then i blacked out, woke up, and i remembered that my phone was on my right side and not my left... so i hallucinated a ghost phone Lol.",1
Holy hell,"Just needed somewhere to vent. I’ve been taking about 100mg Seroquel every night for two weeks even though I’m not prescribed nor do I have a diagnosed mental illness. The stuff helps me sleep, which I’ve been struggling with since I can remember. Although it helps knock me out, I usually wake up 2-4 times during the night and will sleep walk while being somewhat conscious awake. I’ve also been having bizarre dreams that are a a lot more vivid than the norm for me. Last night I had a dream I was with my mom and we were talking in front of a mirror and I started crying then the room went darker and we disappeared. Not sure why but that scared the shit out of me. For a little backstory, my dad has custody and my mom lives 3 hours away, I rarely see her so it’s an emotional subject for me. Fast forward to a few moments before I wake up for the first time in the night (maybe 3am?) I open my eyes and it’s almost completely dark in my room. I feel an insane amount of pressure on my chest, all I felt was terror and darkness. I couldn’t speak and my body felt like I was fully paralyzed and glued flat to my bed. I was frustrated but more than anything, afraid. Like, truly afraid. I don’t remember much from the transition into actually waking up, but it was only moments after the paralysis. No more Seroquel for this girl B)",1
Why is sleep paralysis horrible? Can melatonin help?,"I’ve been experiencing sleep paralysis 2-4 times a month and it just ruins my night. I can’t even go back to the room, I am terrified. 

I was having trouble sleeping and kept tossing and turning every 2-3 min. 

I finally changed positions one last time turning to my right side, when I felt something come into the room.

I even felt it approaching like a dark shadow energy. 

It got close to me and felt like this energy was holding down my left arm. I could not move. 

(At this moment I realized what was happening and tried moving, I tried really hard...) 

Whatever it was got close to me and whispered in my ear. It made like this electric buzzing noise. 

I finally was able to move and nothing was there.

Is there anything I can do to stop this? I hate it so much.. 

I’ve noticed that taking melatonin stops my dreams all together. 

Has melatonin helped anyone else? 

Thank you",1
Is it normal that SP demons look like regular humans?,"Just woke up from my most intense sleep paralysis experience so far. My head still feels very muddy as I'm writing this.

After years of having SP every now and then, I think I finally met my demon. So far he's been nothing but kind to me, never talked, just did things like soothingly patting my head and back or showing me animals for comfort. Sometimes he'd lift my hands, but very gently. 

Nowadays I'm not afraid at all of SP, instead I feel actually excited to see what's going to happen. And just now I was paralysed for about an hour, briefly woke up here and there but got immediately pulled back into paralysis every time. 

My demon was there through the entire experience, taking my hands, cuddling up to me and holding me close. At some point he also said something to me and I apologised, but unfortunately I can't remember what it was . When I tried to look at his face, his eyes briefly flashed red which freaked me out for a moment, but I felt that he wasn't dangerous so I calmed down again. All in all it felt very comforting. 

Is it normal that demons have human form? He was built like a viking, with long darkbrown hair and beard and tattoos all over his body. Very friendly face. I'm unsure what to make of all this, but I'm looking forward to meet him again and maybe ask some questions if I'm able to.",1
"When I have these false awakening dreams, am I sleeping with my eyes open?","I have a lot of looped false awakening dreams where I’m looking at my wall but unable to move.   I try to put my hands out in front of me but they’re invisible (maybe they’re my “dream hands” because my actual body is paralyzed?) 

I’m eventually able to feel my way out of bed and go downstairs (at this point I’m definitely dreaming) and it’s more like a regular false awakening dream, but I keep waking up and I feel like I’m really looking at my wall. When I actually wake up I’m looking at exactly what I saw while I was dreaming, which leads me to believe that I’m having sleep paralysis with my eyes open... I’m not totally certain.",1
Sleep paralysis and trying to figure out what's going.,"having sleep paralysis about a month back. I have had horrible nightmares on and off through my life but this is the first time with this experiance. The first time I woke up middle of the night to see a shadow figure standing in the corner with a hat on. There was a lady sitting on the floor next to my bed she didn't look the hag they mention but she was creepy. The man kept getting closer to me and I couldn't move and in my head I called on angels the white light of protection and God and he eventually stopped. The next night I laid there not wanting to sleep but I did fall asleep eventually. Luckily my cat which I knew could feel my anxiety sleep in between and the corner and honeslty I could feel his presence but it wasn't able to get to me. In the meantime I have had sleep paralysis a few times a week seeing the shadow man. Several times I noticed before I went to sleep and its dark in the room my desktop computer would turn on and off ( you have to touch the mouse for it to come on) It would stay on and flicker and one night I yelled, leave me alone and turn off the light!"" Then my computer monitor turned off and didn't come back on. However I did have sleep paralysis that night. This has happened several times and on several occasions my husband would tell me that he would wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and see my computer turning off and on ( also have checked to debunk if something is wrong with my computer and it's fine, it does not do this during the day at all). Last night I had sleep paralysis and it was a women and she was shaking me and her eyes went from brown eyes to solid black and she started laughing hysterically at me. I later found out my husband woke up at 3:33 and he said the computer was turning off and on again. He doesnt really care about paranormal stuff but it was enough to make him say something to me which is even odd. Anyway any insight to what is going on would be helpful 🙏 honestly after seeing the black eyed women I was more freaked out where before I was just dealing with it.",1
my sp night terror,"My first and I pray only sleep paralysis experience consisted of a man that looked liked a mannequin but had a shadowy tint to him. My lights began to flicker as he grew abnormally large and got very close to my face. As this was happening I heard 2 static-like tornado sirens going off, and that got louder as he grew closer. It got to a point where me and him were eye to eye, and the sirens became deafening. My heart began to beat out of my chest and I felt like I was being pulled to the bottom of the ocean or like I had a 2 ton wrecking ball dropped on my chest. Not being able to breathe, I tried screaming and crying for my mom, hoping she would hear me and come to my aid and I even tried throwing myself off my bed. Yet... Nothing worked, it was like I was frozen in time and only able to move my eyes. Eventually I heard a loud pop, closed my eyes and snapped into reality. Woke up with tears running down my face, not realizing what had just happened! 

I don’t know if this was the cause of it, but I feel that I should mention I was on a 1 month journey to try and lucid dream. I would listen to binaural beats every night and lay flat on my back to try and enter a lucid dreaming stage, until well... this happened. I still to this day want to lucid dream, but the experienced I had with sp was (no exaggeration) by far my most traumatic experience I have yet to go through, and I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy. 

If you guys have had something similar to this, please let me know I would be really interested to hear it, thank you for reading!!",1
Questions about my sleep paralysis.,"This is gonna be kind of long, so please bare with me... I call it my better sleep paralysis because every time I look it up online I hear about people experiencing shadow figures, or demons, or the feeling of someone sitting on their chests. And while mine freak me out, those sound terrifying. Mine are different though. They happen when I’m falling asleep and it starts when I close my eyes and I have an image in my head that’s frightening. The last time it happened I shut my eyes and saw a truck headed straight for me so I opened my eyes immediately but could not move my body, or my head, and I heard the truck noises getting louder and louder. When it was finally over I couldn’t fall asleep for a couple more hours, fearing it would happen again. It didn’t. Another very rememberable time was when I was asleep on my aunts couch and right across from me is the staircase and the wall. The wall is lined with clocks (my aunt collects them) and I had just fallen asleep when I got another image in my head and thought I was dreaming. I tried to open my eyes and when I finally could I couldn’t move but I could hear every sound coming from those clocks. Like I said, it’s not as scary as other experiences I’ve read about, but it does worry me going to bed at night because of it. I have some questions if anyone can answer them for me, that’d be awesome! 

1. I can’t recall this happening at my house at all. I stay with my aunt quite a bit, and it only happens over there. Does certain rooms trigger it?? 

2. Has anyone else experienced something similar to my experiences?? Not with the shadow figures or demons or anything like that. Just noises and not being able to move?? 

3- Does anyone have any tips on how I can prevent it so I can sleep at night?? Or how to stop it when it’s happening?? 

Thank you!!",1
A typical night,"I spend 3 days awake.. I'm tired... I'm restless... I want to sleep...i drink myself to sleep. I finally sleep. I feel good. Has it ended? Maybe just for the night. That's okay. One night is good. It's a start...

What am I experiencing in my sleep?,"I used to have it more ofter in the past - like i have a period that it happened once a week. 

Last night, it happened after 1-2 year for the first time.

I was basically having a dream in which i was still in the same bed, seeing the same setting around me. And in this dream i had other(normal) dream too. And the dream were so bad that i wanted to wake myself up, but when i experienced tingling and high pitch voices in my head like it was going to explode. I managed to fall asleep again and it happend another time over and over.

I remember that in the past, only thing to stop this feeling was waking up and just sitting for 1-2 minutes. Then, when i went to sleep again it didn't happen for the remaining phase.

Anyone knows how is this called and how can i prevent it?",1
Multiple episodes of SP a ‘night’.,"Does anyone else experience multiple episodes of sleep paralysis in a short space of time? When I say multiple I mean between 5-15 times and often in a very short space of time (1-3 hours), one after another. I get the sleep cycles bit, done the research, just wondering!?

I have some mental health issues the main one being Bipolar Disorder. I have recently started taking Lamotrigine (Lamictal) and I take 100mg in the morning and 100mg at night. However this is not the first time I have experienced this type of sleep disturbance. I have had bouts of SP throughout my adult life, including these recurrent episodes, some of the worst when I first started travelling in Asia (I’m from the U.K.). At the time I knew different time zones, sleeping on my back and upheaval of routine was the likely cause of this. This particular time I have been getting it when I sleep on my side which I know is rarer. I’m fully aware that the medication (and my condition) is a likely cause of these particular episodes, but i have still experienced this when not on my meds. 

I’m just generally putting feelers out as it seems hard to find information (or experiences) on these recurrent episodes. Other than the named disorder ‘Recurrent Isolated Sleep Paralysis’, but even then there’s fuck all info about it 🤷🏻‍♂️

TIA everyone 🙏🏻😊",1
Hallucinations of gigantic spiders,"I don’t know if this is considered to be a part of sleep paralysis or not but sometimes when I first wake up and I’m lying in bed, it looks like there are giant spiders crawling on my ceiling/walls. After a few seconds, they disappear. Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this?",1
"Is sleep paralysis a consistent occurrence, or possibly exhaustion related?","Some background, I am not a Morning person, never have been, but for the last 15 years have been in the constant position of having to get up early (if it’s past 6 I’m having major problems for the rest of the day on almost any given day, 5 is the normal latest I should be up at). I’ve always had. Hard time doing this, if I’m lucky I can get to lay down for bed between 11 to midnight in recent months (better than the prior window of midnight to two am). 
So, recently I’ve been trying to wake up earlier to try to get ahead of things and am trying to set a habit of waking up early enough to start working out again, as I’m getting dramatically out of shape. By my calculations I need to be up by 3:15 am. 
I don’t seem to be able to do this, but I have been able to get up at 4 am a few times a week. Here is where the whatever I’m having has started happening in recent weeks, getting steadily worse as I get more consistent waking up at 4. 

I’ll hear the alarm, but not be able to move to turn it off or get up. Before I used to often straight sleep through alarms, and I still sometimes sleep through my early alarm, but several times in the last week I’ll hear my alarm, and be stuck listening to them. Meanwhile, today being the worst I’ve ever had of this, some of the most insane thoughts I’ve ever had and are flooding me like visions as I try desperately to move or get up over the course of I’d say four hours, couldn’t move like I had zero strength in my body. Hurt to try, but I’ll end up facing consequences from not being up and I could not make it happen. left me very irritated and all morning so far I’m wondering if I can go the day without snapping at some one. I could hear my alarms, and other people in the house getting ready for the day. 

Even after managing to get up I’m not clear headed, definitely extremely irritated (I’m usually irritated and tired after this sort of nightmare like event) 

Also, don’t know if this is a factor but close to a decade ago I was diagnosed with sleep apnea, sever sinus damage and moderate hearing loss (hearing related to military service).

So I’m trying to figure if it could be triggered by not getting enough rest over a long period of time? basically my body rebelling. telling me to fuck off while it tries to get its minimum rest needed to function? This isn’t the first time I’ve had similar experience but recently has been intense and more frequent vs a general sense of being awake and unable to move that I’d have occasionally.

I think there’s more details but I’m sort of groggy and am already very behind and started working now after starting to type this post",1
Covid-19 Prayer,"Someone at work got positive for Covid-19. So I quarantined myself until I had the results(came negative). This caused great stress to my mom. She would call and say god help me please stuff like that.

Two nights ago, I had sleep paralysis. I saw my door unlock and open slowly. I wanted to close my eyes because I hate hallucinations. Came in walking was a big pale old lady that looked like Mozgus from Berserk. I shut my eyes so I won't see her. I started to hear things, I heard my mom. She told Lady Mozgus, ""There he is..."" 

They started to pray for me. I tried to move, but can't because of sleep paralysis. As I struggle to move, Lady Mozgus came closer and whispered to me, ""do not struggle, I am here to help.""

Felt like my body was getting jerked around, but I finally gain full consciousness and woke up.

RSP,"     Figured this was a good place to share this. I had my first SP episode when I was around 10 or 12 in my grandparents house. Still live there with my grandmother and ex Marine Uncle. I was laying in bed, and I woke up to a very large shadow figure with a top hat/ bowler hat and white pits for eyes and he was at least 8 feet tall. Now, I wasn’t scared but I knew this wasn’t normal. I slowly being picked up by my fingers towards the end of my bed while he just looked down at me. My mind KNEW I was asleep and I could feel my eyelids shut but I could still see. (Trippy af lol) I felt whatever force it was let go, and I woke up falling back onto my bed. I fell back to sleep moments later. What I find strange about this now is that I know if you’ve succumbed to SP, then fall right back to sleep nine times out of ten you’ll fall right back into it but I didn’t. 

    Fast forward a few years, I’m in HS Freshman year in science class, barely got any sleep typical DGAF attitude until I just slam my head on the heavy ass tables we used involuntarily and fall asleep. Again, I felt the eyelid thing and I couldn’t break free until after five minutes of fighting. Felt like 30 seconds. 

      After this episode, it gradually went down but I did experience “other” things that don’t belong in this SR. I had one where my vision was blurred and I was deafened by the R6S reinforce wall sound. I’ve been to concerts and rage vest and they don’t come anywhere close to how loud that shit was. 

      Worked at Walmart for a year and a half, had typical can’t move or wake up fits with no hallucinations. But when I’m at my fiancé’s house and experience it, her door is always sideways in the doorway, and a shadow man is peering in. And when I say sideways I literally mean that instead of opening in or out, it opens up or down. Imagine if you grabbed the top lip of the door and pulled down and the door pivoted in the middle and you could swing it up and down and spin it. That’s what it was. 

     Have some more that I can’t remember if anyone is interested when I remember them. Hope you guys get some good sleep.",1
I want to know what I have (possible EHS?),"Okay so I’ve been frequently having what I think is sleep paralysis for about three or four years now. Nothing too strange, I’d just feel like I’m falling and I’d hear voices in my sleep or even hallucinate up a dead woman in front of me. But today it’s different.

Like usual, my head would fill up with something like static until it felt like my head was going to explode. I acknowledged it in my dreams a couple of times, how I was going to die because it is a scary experience. But today it was like eight times worse than usual. It hurt so much... I woke up and my jaw is in pain and my head hurts to touch. I get that this may be all just in my head, but I’ve had enough. I just want to know what it is. 

If anyone has any ideas then please let me know. Thank you",1
Was this sleep paralysis?,"One time about a year ago I fell asleep with Star Trek the Next Generation on. I had a dream where I was watching myself sleep from the corner of my bedroom, levitated in the air. Next to me laid Data, who was laying in a spooning position (he was big spoon) resting his hand on my back and whispering into my ear. 

The feeling of him being an entity or presence was intense. It was very powerful. I watched but did not feel terrified. I essentially watched what felt like an entity lay in bed with me while I slept and touch my back. I woke up disturbed and felt like something really did touch my back. 

Is this sleep paralysis? I felt so strongly the entity that took on Data’s form was a separate being. Like I met something “other.” Also, I’ve never had another dream where I was watching myself sleep like an observer in the corner.",1
Man screaming in ear,"This was a while ago but when I last had sleep paralysis I heard a tap dripping, then a man screaming. it was very weird. Not had anything for years fortunately but it does make me wonder. Has anyone had similar?",1
"Had a SP in a dream, definitely weird","I don't usually nap, but today I was having a lazy day off and eventually I dozed off around 4pm. I was dreaming and all of a sudden I had a sleep paralysis in the dream: I wasn't awake in my bed as usual, but I was still in the dream and the dream setting didn't change at all.

In the dream, I was at my parents' house, my fiance was working in my father's study and I was chilling on the balcony right outside the study. The dream interpretation is a story for another day, but in the dream I was feeling peaceful, relaxed and fulfilled, definitely a very nice mood. All of a sudden, I felt dizzy and extremely weak, like I was about to pass out drunk. I couldn't keep my eyes open and every tiny movement was a huge effort, I couldn't keep my head up. And then I heard it, the SP noise which I can't properly describe, but I've heard it plenty of times during my SP. It's like the buzzing in your head you hear after a very loud concert or explosion, but more high pitched and very loud, almost *material*, as it has its own texture, if this makes sense.

Usually, after more than 20yrs of sleep paralysis, I'm pretty good in figuring out what is happening and how to drag myself out of it and wake up reasonably quick, I haven't had an allucination in years. But in the dream I had no clue and I thought I was about to die, so I tried to crawl towards the door and reach my fiance, and it was definitely the same feeling I have had during every SP. I tried to move but I couldn't, I was conscious of the physical effort I was doing despite my body ignoring the commands, the usual stuff. But in the dream I really thought that I was going to die and I panicked pretty bad. After a few minutes I got a text and the phone buzzing woke me up immediately.

Now that I'm conscious, I think that it definitely felt like a SP except for the fact that I was in a dream and the dream remained intact, same setting, same environment, nothing changed around me at all. I don't know if the fact that I was sleeping near a window wide open had something to do with dreaming of being on the balcony, but still, I wasn't awake at all during the paralysis.

Any thoughts or similar experiences?

Being Choked.,"I don’t even know how to start this. I’ve had sleep paralysis for years maybe due to depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses common in my family. However a couple of hours ago I had probably one of my worst experiences. This all happened hours from each other... I had opened my eyes because of feeling of dread started washing over me, I wanted to move but I was paralyzed and I could feel a presence next to me which I figured was my mom since she sleeps next to me when she gets panic attacks so the feeling of dread quickly washed away feeling safe that she was there next to me. I went back to sleep as if nothing happened since I’m kinda used to it but after an hour or two I feel the presence that was next to me get on top of me. I felt two hands grab my throat and start to strangle me, my body was frozen and my eyes were fixated at the pitch black ceiling. I was petrified as I could not breathe and I could swear it was someone choking me for I could feel the warmth of human hands on my neck and somebody talking under their breath. Once I could move my arms I tried to pull away the hands from my throat but their weren’t any and the feeling subsided. I turned on the light expecting to see someone hiding but the room was empty. I went over to my mothers room to make sure she was okay and that nobody was in the house. She woke up when I entered the room and immediately asked me if I was okay. I asked her if she was in my room at any point of the night and she said no. I haven’t been able to sleep since, I feel so tired but I’m scared it might happen again. Have any of you felt as if someone was choking you? Should I drink more melatonin to help me sleep?",1
I'm 16 (m) and I have just started to have SP. I need advice on what to do. I'm afraid to sleep.,"I've only experienced it 3 times so far. The first time was when I was waking up and I had no clue what was going on. I didn't see any scary figures or anything but I felt a horrible weight on me and I felt like I was going to suffocate and I couldn't scream.  The second time I woke up from a nightmare with it and same thing happened.  I cant move at all and I cant scream or talk no matter how hard I try.  The third was in the same day.  I laid down for a nap a couple hours after it happened the first time because I woke from the nightmare really early in the day.  Which was today. I havnt seen any scary figures or anything but since its only happened 3 times I dont know if they will appear or not.  My father is one of those pentecostal ""everything is the devil"" people and he just told me its all psychological and it isn't real and I just need to watch what I listen too and watch.  I really need advice because I am terrified and my dad does as he does, minimalize everything. How do I get him to take this seriously? How do I deal with the fear of going to sleep? Will the SP stop occurring or am I past the point where it will keep happening? Will the scary figures and hallucinations start appearing? Is there any connection to sleep paralysis and what you watch on TV? Please help.
Edit: it just happened again.  I was sleeping on my side against a wall and it still happened.  I'm scared",1
First time having sleep paralysis but my story doesnt seem to match others I read about.,"So I had a weird series of events happen to me not long ago. First I had a weird dream that ended in me being grabbed by something and then next thing I know is that I was awake in my bed with a man speaking loud into my ear but I could not see him, also I could not understand him. Then it felt as if there was a bass speaker in my head drowning out all other sound. I also felt completely numb but yet I could hear my brother playing games in the next room and when I went to yell or make any noise all I did was breathe out. I became frantic but yet I realized I could move my left arm and from this I became aware of everything and I thought I was awake and I can't remember but I thought I flipped myself over the side of my bed and hit the ground. I then woke up for real after that laying in the position I was originally in. Can someone please explain why I could move during the paralysis, was it from my brother playing too loud or just because I became aware. Or even that this was not sleep paralysis but some screwed up nightmare. Btw I should note that these events lasted 20 minutes from when I went to sleep.

Edit: I forgot to include that during what I could see besides my ceiling, is that it was like a vignette filter was around my eyes also that I also did experience seeing something like a shadow with its hands wrapped under my jaw and looking over me but it wasnt clear enough to make that assumption. Now that I type that out I guess a good visualization would be those baby things from transit on Black Ops 2 zombies after you roam away from the bus.",1
Static Shadow People,"Posting this to see if anyone has ever had a similar experience. I’ve heard of these shadow people many times, but had never experienced them until this instance, in my experience they weren’t necessarily “shadows”.

As the sleep paralysis ensued, I was in perfect alignment to be looking at the door to my room (which was closed) it opened, a tall masculine figure was standing there, he had a bowlers cap on or some kind of fedora maybe? It was a 3 dimensional silhouette. 

The thing is he wasn’t shadowy at all, his body looked like TV static. After he opened the door he slowly began walking towards me, I could hear what sounded like thousands of whispering voices emanating from his body, louder and louder as he got closer. He then stood above me looking down at me, a no more than a foot away. The whispering became deafening, I snapped out of it.

This is a true story, I’m curious if anyone else has experienced something similar to this as it was my first time encountering some type of “being” while sleep paralysis occurred. Thoughts will be appreciated, thanks for reading.",1
What caused my paralysis?,"I experienced paralysis when I listened to this one night...maybe this is the cause? Give it a try and see if it happens to you too.

Sleep paralysis as an 7-8 year old,"When I was really young, around 7 or 8, I experienced a lot of sleep paralysis, every single night, to the point where I would intentionally keep myself awake. My parents trying to get me to bed was a nightmare, I eventually would sleep with them but it didnt help at all, the demons still came. 

I would see things coming out of my closet, the door would open and the demons would come to my bed and float above me, parallel and move me around, raking their claws up and down my back. Sometimes they would whisper to me things I couldnt understand but the claws were the worst.

Finally and abruptly it ended after 2 months but even to this day it still happens. I have learned how to try and wake up or get myself out of that state so it seems manageable, but Those hallucinations still haunt me to this day. When I was that age I also experienced a lot of seemingly paranormal things in the house I grew up in. I would see figures and see things moving around when there should be nothing there. 

I guess my question is that does anyone believe that these sleep demons are real paranormal events or possibly connected? I'm sorry if this is a common question but I have never really discussed this with anyone. I know there is a logical explanation for the hallucinations but I cant shake the weird presence in that townhouse I grew up in. Whenever I bring it up to people, I am dismissed and laughed at, which is kind of annoying since this traumatized me as a child.",1
Does my experience sound like sleep paralysis?,"This is the second this this has happened now:

I was napping on my back (I usually sleep on my side). Suddenly I couldn’t move in my dream, then I realized that I’m dreaming, and then as I started to wake up I could barely move. When I say barely, I mean I was only able to move my fingers at first and then after about 5-10 seconds of realizing I was awake I was able to roll onto my side.

No auditory or visual hallucinations; I did experience tinnitus which I commonly get when I’m anxious.

Never had an experience like this at night or during a 2+ hour sleep.

Anyone have similar experiences? Does it sound like sleep paralysis? Sleep paralysis is pretty much my worst fear so I fear it starts like this. Any advice appreciated.",1
"Anyone else experienced a ""vibrating"" sensation in their head?","I've recently been having some strange sleep paralysis episodes.

Usually I wake up and cannot move and just feel what I can only describe as a scary feeling and my partner says I kind of make the noise of a zombie lol, I snap out of it after she gives me a shake and go back to sleep fine. But the past few nights I've been waking up unable to move and feeling this extreme vibrating sensation in my head along with the scary atmosphere. It's hard to describe but if you can imagine a machine turning or an engine or something like that and resting your head against it, it's very intense but the other strange thing is I felt as though I was half conscious of this vibrating feeling and could almost come in and out of it consciously. As this is happening my partner was shaking me each time ""I went in"" and getting me out of it but as soon as I let myself I got the feeling again. 

Sleep paralysis crossed with a lucid dream? Was just unusual for me so I thought I would share, maybe someone's had a similar experience or this is a heads up before it happens to you :)",1

How to destroy SP Demons,"Well, as a novice of experiencing SP, I picked up other info, to be able to make this post. There is a small amount of ways, and I know only five. I will now begin.  


First Way - If the demon is getting closer to you, start screaming. The demon should just disappear.  


Second Way - Keep on saying in yourself ""You are not real, you are a part of my inner imagination"".  


Third Way - Since demons are parts of your imagination, imagine a way to kill him without moving (whispering, etc.).  


Fourth Way - There were rumors that if you're laying on your shoulder, no demons would appear, but I  believe that's truth. I had sleep paralysis when I slept on my shoulder, and there was no demons.  


Fifth Way -  If you are sleeping with somebody (your partner or other) demons should never appear.",1
Sleep paralysis inside a dream inside a dream?,"This happened 10 minutes ago. I woke up today at 6am. That has nothing to do with this, but I went back to sleep at 8am probably. I had a lucid dream. One of my first ones actually. It was probably my longest one. Only about 30-50 seconds. Then I think I woke up. Not sure that I actually woke up. I'll get to that in a second. When I ""woke up"" I was watching Netflix again, (I watched Netflix before I went back to sleep) I was very tired again but I went to watch a series I didn't know. It looked like an '80s show. There were 2 characters. That's all I remember. Then I fell asleep. I was in a bed. I couldn't move. Oh shit. You see where this is going. I was well aware of what sleep paralysis is so I didn't panic too much. I can't say it was that scary. I saw a woman with a white suit on. She was in front of me. I could see her legs. And I saw some bloody red smiling faces around me. I slowly looked up, and I saw her neck. I was terrified so I just closed my eyes and wiggled my fingers, I didn't want to get traumatized by her face. It was thankfully over quickly. That was my first sleep paralysis ever. Now I ""woke up"" again and I was lying on my bed and I saw my mother standing besides me. Now I woke up for real. I opened my phone and I was watching Breaking Bad. So I never woke up after the lucid dream. So it was all just a dream.",1
"So I read many SP stories and I wanted to experience it, but it (for me) was a big mistake...","So I loved watching videos of scary stuff, like SP stories, and always wondered what It would be like to HAVE one of this episodes...

I’m 13 and I live in a moderately huge house with both my parents. My sister had just turned 20 and moved out, so now I was the only one with a room upstairs. My little brother’s and parents’ rooms are all downstairs, meaning the only thing accompanying me up here now are the movie room and a few bathrooms.

Personally I was always afraid of the movie room at night because the actual screen is broken and you can always hear the mechanics trying to pull up the projector screen at night and it’s so freaking scary. One time my sister went in there and beat the crap out of it trying to get it to stop beeping and whirring while we were trying to sleep, and it ended up almost pulling her hand into the rollup box. Ever since, I feared that thing the most.

Anyway, past explaining what the setting was, now onto my actual story.

I was trying to sleep after being up all day and I finally fell asleep laying the opposite of my door. I didn’t know what time it was, but I woke up sometime between 5 and 6 because the sun was just coming up. I tried reaching over to grab my phone but I couldn’t move. In my mind, I was like, “Oh my gosh I’m finally experiencing sleep paralysis, this is cool!” That lasted for about a second until I heard a noise coming from the movie room and sounds of chains tearing. Something cut through the wall and the freaky machine was suddenly laying on my floor. The sun went down and it fell into complete darkness. I could hear my mom calling my name but I was terrified to do anything; I couldn’t even DO anything. Then my light came on and the machine was tearing up my left leg by rolling it into the little box. I sat there and stared at it eating away at my leg for at least 25 seconds before I was able to scream. After that, I woke up. Ever since that night, I literally begged my parents to get a new system and move my room downstairs with them, and/or switch it with my little brother’s room.

My morale is:
Don’t wish for sleep paralysis if you’re afraid of something in a room next to you, please.",1

Sleep aid,"Hey r/sleepparalysis, So I've been having sleep paralysis quite frequently this year. My first case of sleep paralysis was about a year ago, and since then I've been getting it 2-3 times a week on average. There was a period where it stopped for 3 months, then came back even worse.   


From personal experience, I would say I get sleep paralysis more than a lot of you. I tried talking to my doctor about SP but he didn't even know what it was really and I had to explain it to him. After a few months of bringing it up here and there, he recommended that I take prazosin. He told me it was used to treat people with PTSD and also night terrors. I was abit skeptical at first, but this stuff has really helped. I still get sleep paralysis but it happens like once a month to ever 3 weeks. Not multiple times a week now.   


Tbh I wouldn't recommend taking this is you only get SP a few times out of the year, but if you are having chronic sleep paralysis like I am ( 2-3 times a week, every week) I would recommend this. It has helped me a lot. I am also a very vivid dreamer, something that I do enjoy, and the medication has made me dream a lot less. (Well at least makes me not remember my dreams. Everyone dreams even if they don't remember it) I don't know if I am still having sleep paralysis and not remembering it or what, but it has helped me.  


So If you are having chronic SP and are at wits end, maybe this can help.",1
Sleep paralysis - a good experience,"Hey guys, I decided to turn into Reddit about this subject as I haven't found anything similar to my own experiences.
Most people see bad things, and have some sort of panic while experiencing sleep paralysis. But does everyone have an and experience?

I had it a few times in my life, but only recently I came to my senses what was actually happening. Basically with me I feel like my body is extremely heavy.  Try to sit (feels physical but it isn't I guess) and it's like my body is bending back from all the weight that I feel on top of me.
Specially my head feels like it's so bended back that I feel the back of my head touching my back.
I try to sit on my bed (as I am half laying down on bed), but the pressure is so extreme that I feel I'm about 30 to 45° sitting.

I had some other different experiences, but I would like to know if you guys ever had anything similar.

Please share if you know what I'm talking about it, or if you also have some non negative sleep paralysis experience.

Sleep paralysis (Not as severe and no nightmare,"So this is happening June 16 2020. My first ""sleep paralysis"".

From what I'm reading from the other posts, it seems that everyone had a nightmare that was happening to them and they could not move their body. This was actually totally different from my experience today.

I was in my dream and it was a sort of ""another life"" dream that I was having. (This one was more believable in terms of reality). I chose to walk down the hallway and was about to turn a corner when I blinked and suddenly could not open my eyes. It was as if a force on my eyelids were glued together. Then I realized  that my mouth was open and I could move my tongue to stick out. So I stuck out my tongue trying to wake up my body, but I couldn't.

I wasn't thinking about moving my arms and legs because I just forgot to try and move them. I tried to go back to sleep. And woke up some time around 7 am. My dream didn't jolt me out of it like others have experienced, or maybe what I had was not sleep paralysis. I did not have any sort of nightmare or any confusion of reality and dream. I never had any hallucinations or hearing sounds, voices, etc. Only the unable to move eyes and possibly body(did not think to try and move my body at time)

Maybe someone has a similar experience like this? Can you call this sleep paralysis or is it something similar?",1
The sleep demon took my boyfriend’s shape,"Hello everyone, this is my first time posting here... I’ve already had some SP episodes in the past and a few more during the past months. What I’d like to tell you is something new that happened a few days ago.

It was after a calm evening and my boyfriend was sleeping at home. Around 3 am, I woke up and my boyfriend’s face was at ten centimeters from mine, we were facing each other and he was sleeping deeply. Suddenly, he started speaking a foreign langage that sounded a bit like german so I started laughing because I had never heard him doing something like that and he doesn’t speak a word of such a language. Then it begins to become a bit more scary : he opens his eyes and I realize the way he stares at me is very different from usual. I wake up a first time and see him in the exact same position... sleeping. Suddenly he starts grumbling again and grabs me. I then start to feel a very unpleasant pressure on the navel (as he was pushing his finger into it) until it hurts so much I can’t breathe anymore. That’s the moment I understand I’m switching alternately from reality to dream, but the moment I fall asleep is unnoticeable. The more I alternate the two states, the more the monster shaped as my boyfriend becomes violent and the less I am able to wake up. I remember clearly screaming as loud as I could and even pushing him back ( I sense his skin and flesh against my hands, I even feared I could hurt him in real life )… But of course I was laying still and all of that didn’t happen.

Does anyone here ever had a similar intercourse with the sleep paralysis monster?",1
I'm on the verge of getting sleepparalysis,"Its 2:30 in the morning,i wake up and go to pee.After that i go back to bed and then few minutes later i'm hearing a trumpet playing(i think its just my imagination)and i just ignore that and go to sleep,and after that i cannot move my both arms and cannot open my eyes,i got rly scared and i forced my body to move,my right eye i guess is almost open and my both arms are like shaking i think,and i finally moved and after that i go to thw kitchen and upload this.

Sorry for bad english and grammar",1

Can sleep paralysis be combined with a lucid dream?,"I just woke up from the most terrifying experience of my life. I felt so tired that i immediately fell asleep on my couch but i started seeing things i was thinking about and none of them were pleasant. I still remember seeing the side of my couch whenever i wanted to but i didnt know if that was a dream? Every single thing i was terrified of every bad memory was there in front of me too. You know how they say lucid dreams are where you can control everything and it sounds like a super fun thing to experience but no, this was terrifying or i made it terrifying i dont know. Then i saw myself awake on the bed but hearing very fast inaudible whispers, and every time i felt awake i was super tired. I’ve had sleep paralysis before but not this intense. I’m wondering if its just a really bad lucid dream?",1
Months without one and this happens,"My online classes in film school (I'm from Chile) stopped so I have way less things to do and I usually get psychological stress when that happens.
I also committed the mistake to sleep with my back straight up and not from the side cuz I falled sleep meditating.

Strangely started with music, there wasn't any but I heared like I had headphones on, then I listened my father's angry voice and aggressive steps (my house is made of wood so steps always make noise) like he was coming to yell at me for listening to music at this hour (I'm 20, and my father is not violent btw).

Then I understood I was in a paralysis, didn't open my eyes cuz I don't wanna see creepy stuff but still heared my brother voice from his room screaming for help and felt 4 hands over me, two were asfixiating me and the lther two were on my pelvis making me feel uncomfortable just by touching my legs.
Also, it felt like it had some sort of religious evil to it, I can't explain it very good, but it felt like that.
I went to sleep 3 50 and woke up from the paralysis 4 20.",1

Sleep paralysis sucks ass,I was at a friends house once we stayed up till 12. I fell asleep and i was stuck in bed. I saw my friend in the corner getting ripped apart by a skinny black figure. The terror in my friends eyes was too realistic. I start to freak the fuck out and thats when the figure walks over to my bed. He starts tearing me limb by limb and the i woke up. I don't recommend having sleep paralysis.,1
Make your dreams your own.,"              Sleep…  We all take for granted, those few hours where we live in our own world. But some of us … ….sometimes, we wake feeling like we have never slept.                          
             When I was only five, my dreams melted into reality. Problems in a household can only lead to some sort of stress induced effects.  Some included a hallucination.               My grandmother would be there with me ""actually there"" but included with my. Woke dreaming … Small machines, working seamlessly with tiny clockworks. They would be in small balls, hovering around my bed… taunting me. Like they would kill me at any moment. .. I was scared shitless. I think I was only five or six years old, tops.                                                                            My grandmother was very religious and would invoke God to make them go away. Surprisingly, she did always help.  Looking back her warmth, she carried me then, emotionally as well as physically.. even with her gone, she always will.                                                                                               I was brought up in a religious manner. My mother, an ordained ""Billy Graham"" minister, bounced from evangelical,  Baptist, Lutheran churches.    I went a different route. Not atheist but not devout.  ….   Anyway,                                                 ………...Over the years, I have had many ,bouts of sleep paralysis. Usually involving an entity holding me down, the usual. Scary as hell, but common. But now, especially looking back at how much I know about it, I have had  more than my share.                 ..                                                       ………..     The last few episodes I did have.  It seems, I can control it better. I am much older, and sometimes. ….  when its happening, i can't utter but a a squeek, but,   a few times, I was actually able to call out to my husband.      It sounded horrible, like I was under water.. screaming out.    Deep from within and an low and slow but my words found their way out. I was dreaming so deep.     .. but my suffocating scream was so piercing, that even in my sleep, my husband pulled the blanket from my body to help pull the drenched sheet.                                                                                                    …… . My dreams may be as scary, as yours, But maybe, we will one day control what we dream, and make it better.                              If only to save ourselves.         By me.. Chanvre",1
"Redditors, What was the worst Sleep Paralysis you had?","I had a sleep paralysis once, but, I never seen a demon. I had a mind thinking, yeah, how about I just watch TV. It was on for some reason, maybe me forgetting to turn it off. Anyways, that sleep paralysis was better than expected...",1
SP since i was 14,"Hello all! dont post often but i felt compelled to as it may help me or someone else to feel better knowing we are not alone.

My first SP would start with typical paralysis and only hearing voices of a woman barely whispering, this went on for a while. i was 14.

sometime after that as i would have sp at least once a week i started to see the woman.(this is the first encounter) i would be frozen completely stuck in my bed, awoken out of no where always around 3:00 AM. she would wait, taunting me and snickering at me behind my bed, she than showed herself to me. a woman who looked like she was made of tree branches, she always has a menacing grin on her face. she waved at me and i went back to sleep(felt like i was drugged) had a horrible nightmare than woke up for the next day.

from than for a couple weeks i would see her over and over, since i was used to the SP i could move a little bit, and to be completely honest every time im IN a sleep paralysis experience, im never scared at the time, im only scared the next night to see her again. (i did have enough strength to flick her off once and laugh back she went batshit crazy and started clawing at me uncontrollably while screaming. but she couldnt reach me, just at the edge of my bed clawing and angry she couldnt hurt me)

&#x200B;

the next time (After the flicking her off incident) i had sleep paralysis,  i woke up to a bright white light next to me (haha i have tears in my eyes thinking about this right now) she whispered to me ""go back to sleep"" and she kissed me so gently on my forehead i had never felt anything more real, even from a real kiss. that night i had the most restful sleep i had had in years, and the demons wouldnt come as often (almost never really)

&#x200B;

well now im 18 and a couple days ago they seem to be returning to their frequent visits (i believe this is because of my drug use) yesterday a bald man with a deep voice towered over me at the side of my bed and he kept repeating ""i have full control over you now"" ""i have full control over you now"". as i said i can move just a bit in my SP but this time i was glued to the bed, thats when i noticed the other demon at the edge of my bed holding his hand out like he was causing me to not move. as a reaction this (i never make concious decisions in SP as it feels im still really dreaming, but i remember it the next day) i started growling at the man, showing my teeth like a wild animal i guess i didnt know what else to do and instinct took over.

&#x200B;

i tried to keep this as short as possible! sorry about the length and thank you for reading guys, do you think your SP has some spiritual element or do you think its all science and your brain type deal. please let me know!",1
Short for dead and sleep paralyse,"I got a lot of sleepparalyse since years. Some days ago I talked with a girl and told her my story. And she said a interesting thing... 
when I was little I was short do dead because I was drowned. 
And she said maybe I was so near to death and the afterlife...that with this moment I opened a door and take it in my life & maybe that’s the reason why ghosts and demons are in my life... 

Anyone else has experience something like this & now has sleeppaaralysis?",1
Traumatic events and SP/lucid dreams,"I recently had a traumatic experience involving cocaine and what appears to have been a panic attack, as I went to the doctor to check and there was no indication of a heart attack or any more serious problem.

After that day, I started to have sleep paralysis several times, and I would like to share some of these episodes.

&#x200B;

First episode:

I lay down to sleep and within a few minutes I went into a strange state of paralysis. I was in my room and the colors were beige like sand, and I heard a strong wind noise as if I were inside a whirlpool. I felt that I was floating just above my body and was trying desperately to wake up. I quickly heard a female voice saying ""I came to get you"", and then I woke up.

&#x200B;

Second episode:

Like the first, colors and the sound of the wind started and I realized that I was in a state of paralysis again. I was slowly floating on top of my body and went into despair, overcome by a strong fear of losing control. After a few minutes of trying to wake up, I did it.

&#x200B;

Third episode:

I fell asleep and went into a lucid dream state, where I was exactly in my room, in my bed, with the light on. It felt like I was talking to someone and that person was saying to me something like ""you are dreaming again, the light will always be there, you just don't go towards it"". There was a very large black spot on the ceiling in the corner, which looked like no demonic entity or figure, or anything that resembled human forms. When the person finished speaking, in a blink of an eye the black shadow was right on top of me, very close to my face, which caused me a huge fright and made me wake up.

&#x200B;

Other episodes:

I had some other brief moments of paralysis, always involving this dark yellow / beige color, with a strong wind noise. The feeling is to be on another plane, in the same physical place, but in a different dimension. Sometimes people are talking, sometimes I'm alone and I try to wake up desperate until I can.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During that period I had some bizarre dreams, some even funny now, but at the time it was pretty scary. The most vivid and striking was the following:

I was in a subway cafeteria eating a disgusting hamburger, which looked like it was made with very poor quality ingredients and a lot of oil. There were some girls there and I started to interact with them, suddenly we were talking about going to my house to have sex and things started to get weird, they started laughing between them and saying things like ""today you are going to eat a lot of pussy"", and suddenly they became men dressed as women. One of them cornered me on a wall and said something I don't remember, but the feeling was extremely desperate and I started to feel short of breath and a twinge in the back of my right rib, which made me wake up.

I know, I mean, what the fuck?

I've always had very vivid dreams all my life, but things are starting to get really weird.

Does anyone have similar experiences? Something like lucid dreams and paralysis after a traumatic event?

Sleep paralysis or did this happen,"I have had only one instance of sleep paralysis when I was initially falling asleep. Last night, however; I brought home a date to stay the night and after being asleep, I woke at around 3 am I couldnt breath and I opened my eyes to what I saw was his wrist under my jaw and I swear I could feel his hand around my neck. He was awake. He pulled away and turned over. I turned over and grabbed my bedside knife not knowing if this really just happened I didnt want to grab my gun. I waited with knive tucked to my side. I asked if he was ok and he said yes he couldn't sleep because he had a headache and he pulled away. He sounded angry and the muttered something; Idk what. I asked what had happened last night and he told me he couldnt sleep from the headache and a sunburn from earlier. He was in fact awake. Did this man choke me in my sleep or was this sleep paralysis. I asked him if he choked me and he had a slight grin and said no. Beyond a shook rn.",1
first SP in years,"I've had SP a few times a few years ago, it was terrifying but once I learned what it was and how to deal with it, it went away. I am now recovering from surgery and because of that only able to sleep on my back. I'm one week in and sleeping was fine, though it wasn't exactly comfortable. This morning however, I woke up in SP after trying to go to sleep again. I didn't see anything, I never did, but I did hear all kinds of different voices talk to me. Some were nice, some were toying around with me and a few were terrifying, they just seemed evil and it was like they wanted to take me to a horrible place. I got out of it pretty quickly, since I knew what to do, and thought I would be able to sleep again. But every time I started to fall asleep again, the voices would come back. They would start out okay with only the nicer voices talking, and then all of the sudden the evil ones would come back and I would be paralyzed again. I've never had SP so many times back to back in one night, so I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this. Is this just one session I had to go through, or should I deal with it it differently than just trying to go to sleep right after it happened?",1
Terrifying SP,"Within the last month, I’ve had two experiences with SP. Both times I have been dreaming and I’m aware that I’m dreaming but I can not wake up at all. The first time, I was trying to wake myself up but it was like something was pinning me down. When I finally was able to wake up, my body felt like it was vibrating and my heart was beating fast. My anxiety was through the roof and I felt like I just got done running as fast as I could.

The second time was just earlier this morning and it was all the same except, in my head, I was trying to tell my husband to help me up and I was screaming it in my head but I couldn’t actually say anything out loud. I finally shot up and scared the crap out of my husband. My body again felt like it was vibrating and I was hyperventilating. Before these times, it’s been about 10 years since the last time I had experienced this. It’s been terrifying and it makes me scared to go to sleep. 

I know these dreams were vivid but it’s like it all just disappears as soon as I wake up. 🤦🏻‍♀️",1
SP from tiredness/ can anyone relate?,"I guess I'm just sharing my experiences bc I  would like to communicate it. But usually, when this happens to me (since it's happened a handful number of times) I can wiggle my fingers or toes before it takes me over completely. Also, it usually happens when I'm lying flat on my back. 

Oh the most important part is that it has happened (until last night) exclusively in the bed in my room (LOL it's probably haunted). BUT only twice have I heard anything ( my name, and to be quiet), but thankfully I have never seen anything/anyone. I'm also not sure how I end up back to sleep because in my right mind, i would be too freaked out to sleep in the same place.

However, last night I was sleeping in a different place on my stomach. I didn't expect it to happen because it never has before like that, and twice I fought it off because I didn't want to experience it anymore. But the third time I felt it happening, I gave in and oddly it felt like something was being pulled out of my back, but didn't quite make it (can anyone relate? my soul?) But yeah I had a pretty vivid dream/vision and it felt more pleasant than other SP occasions because I actively tried to stay calm and was saying affirmations in my head the entire time.

That was a lot, but yeah if anyone can relate, lmk. thanks!",1
My sleep paralysis from stress," The first time I had sleep paralysis, I was on my last grade of elementary school. It was after I had been on a surgery and I had tons of exams to do and I was really stressed out about it. When I woke up at night, the first thing I saw was a silhouette of a man on the corner of my room. I didn't know what was going on and I thought some random person was in my room. It was too big to be my mom and my father doesn't live with us. The silhouette started to approach me and I was really scared. When the silhouette was right above me, it started to back down. It went back to the corner of my room. Then it started to approach me again and it did the same thing several times before it disappeared and I could move again. I couldn't sleep very well for the rest of the night. I didn't even know that sleep paralysis was a thing before and got to know about it the next day at school when my classmates were talking about it. I was like, ""holy shit I had a sleep paralysis last night"", and hoped I'd never got one again.

Three years go by and I'm on my last grade of junior high school. It was Christmas holiday and the finals would be coming at spring. I was again stressing pretty much about all the exams and the fact that I would have to decide where and what I would want to study, since I had no idea. Before the second time I had the sleep paralysis, I had a really bad nightmare first. In that nightmare I was running away from some big and weird man. When the man got hold of me, the nightmare would start again. It didn't matter how fast I ran or where I hid and no matter what I did or where ever I escaped, the man would eventually get me and the dream would start over. I was scared for my life and I could even feel the panic physically. After god knows how many times the dream started over, I woke up to the fact that I was screaming. Or, at least trying to scream. No sound came from my mouth and I was trying to gasp air as much as I could. I couldn't move and I looked every where I could and I could feel my panic from the dream rushing back. My heart was beating fast and for a while I thought I would suffocate, but then I could see a black silhouette from my corner of eye. It was hushing me and saying things like, ""it's okay"", before sitting on my bed next to me. It's hand was slowly but soothingly patting my head while it hummed and I felt myself calming down. After calming down it got easier to breathe and I couldn't hear my heart beating anymore in my ears. Just like the first time, I didn't realise I was having sleep paralysis and I honestly thought that the silhouette was just my mom who had somehow heard me. After a while I fell asleep again. When I woke up at the morning I asked from my mom if she had heard me on previous night. At first my mom looked confused and then laughed that she had slept like a rock. I came quickly to that conclusion that I indeed had had an another sleep paralysis.

I think I got both of my sleep paralysis from stressing out so much. First time it was hella scary, second time it actually helped me to calm down. After that second time I haven't had anymore sleep paralysis and to be honest, I'm not that scared of them anymore.",1

i don't get creepy sht when i sp anymore: a story,"Note: This my real experience with SPs. I didn't want to share them but thought, maybe I could help someone. Or maybe someone out there just wants to learn/read more on SP experiences.

&#x200B;

*Story:*

I was young when I first had an SP. I wasn't even aware of it but I felt a presence behind me that was so strong and *unsettling*. I wanted to turn around or run far, far away but I couldn't. It was terrifying. 

The second time it happened, it was years later. I felt my body paralysed. Fear gripping onto me and latching to every part of my body when I heard demonic laughter so close to my ears. It sounded if some man, no, *demon* enjoyed watching my fear eating me alive and my futile attempts to scream for bloody murder. That happened *twice*, only seconds apart before the I ran the moment I was able to move.

The worst part was that the more I was afraid, the more it was intense and the longer it held.

I had multiple S.P. from there on, sometimes multiple times a week. Each and every one of them was filled with helplessness and suffocating fear. But for every event, I learned. I learned what was real and what was not. I learned the exact moment I was about to fall into S.P. and managed to drag my ass out of the bed. But of course, I sometimes fail. It's a hard battle to yank yourself out.

For each and every event,  I kept telling myself it wasn't real and that it was merely just illusions from my brain. Therefore, I started to fear less and less.

Then, it was one night? or was it a day? that I had another S.P. event. I felt huge spider limbs crawling onto me. I immediately wanted to run but I couldn't. I started to realise that it was not real but yet it does feel so real. Too real, I guess that's why it's so unsettling. I wanted to scream but I was just so damn tired so instead--

I imagined it massaging my body. It felt damn good. It was shortlived however when I felt every single limb snap one by one. Then, it was gone. I could move.

Now, every time I get S.P.'s I don't see, hear, nor feel all those terrifying stuff. It's just plain paralysis. Now, I'm not complaining because I am for sure relieved for not having to experience those again. It's just that, it was such a good massage.

&#x200B;

**What I learned: Don't be afraid. They aren't real and they can't hurt you. If they do then that's next-level stuff that you should definitely seek for help.**

*TL;DR:* The moment I stopped fearing SP's and started to imagine them doing something nice or funny, it quickly disappears.",1
Does anyone else experience light in their eyes as a trigger for SP??,"I have read lots about how sleeping on your back makes SP more likely (same for me), but haven’t been able to find anyone discuss light in their eyes as something that can also trigger it. I usually only get sleep paralysis when I nap, and if there’s any sort of ambient light hitting my eyes (like sunlight coming through the window or if I accidentally fall asleep with the lights on), I know I am definitely going to slip into SP. As such, I try remember to nap with a mask over my eyes, which usually does the trick to stop it. Just curious if anyone else experiences this correlation between light and SP?",1
"Vivid hallucination, medical or spiritual event? Sleep paralysis?","I wrote this out to document my first experience last night. I’ve never had sleep paralysis, don’t dream much, and rarely have nightmares when I do. I’ll preface this with a few details. I’ve been sick with what I can only assume to be covid19 since March. I’ve been feeling generally better but having a lot of inflammation everywhere. The dog that I mention we had for 7 years, he was my best buddy and he sadly crossed the rainbow bridge about two weeks ago. Also, like much of the world right now, my stress and anxiety levels have been pretty high. 

Last night I went to sleep watching tv. My breathing and heartbeat feels weird, but it has been for the last several days. Body begins to vibrate, increasing gradually.

Tunnel vision imagery of Marley playing in the backyard of our old house. Looks like looking through binoculars backward and is blurry like I’m not wearing any glasses or contacts. Images begin to change shape into a curved bridge composed of the different images and it flowing at a fast rate. I’m seeing the images from above now and I feel my body begin to lift and go forward in the same direction and speed as the images. This stops suddenly and I now see our bedroom but as if in 3rd person. My eyes are closed and I cannot move. My breathing has slowed and my breaths are shallow, my heart begins to beat very hard and increasingly fast. In the corner I see a black shadow figure, it almost looks to be human in shape but has the fluid movement of a cloud. As soon as I see the figure it suddenly appears much closer now and is sitting at my side. I feel what I can best describe as a hand, but much larger, place itself on my abdomen. A sudden, extreme rush of euphoria overcomes my entire body. The closest example I can compare to is receiving IV morphine in the hospital, it was an immediate effect. I no longer can feel my heart beat and I don’t notice myself breathing. I begin to feel very warm but in a euphoric, summer sun shining on you first thing in the morning feeling. The figure begins to pull a large glowing reddish-orange ball from my abdomen. It does not hurt, the more the ball of light comes out the more euphoric I begin to feel. Behind the figure I see the walls of the bedroom change into different scenery and patterns, mostly desert and sand. The figure conceals the ball within itself and floats out of the room, taking me with it. I begin to feel as if I am floating above my body, first slowly, then at jet speed. After that it’s blank, I wake up and it’s around 1:30 am and I’m drenched in sweat. 

So far today the long list of Symptoms I have been experiencing over the last month, and some of the worst being within the last week, all appear to be either gone or unnoticeable.",1
I don’t know what this was but I can’t find anything about it so I thought I’d ask here..,"When I was 17 yrs old or so (I’m now 25) I had a pretty traumatic experience.. I fell asleep in my living room when suddenly I start sleep walking, but I’m awake watching. I can’t control my body but I’m able to see what’s happening. So I start walking to my bedroom and stand in front of my dresser for a moment or so. I then reach into my drawer and pull out Acetone (nail polish remover) and start walking back to the living room where i was sleeping. I then opened the bottle and started to drink it slowly. As soon as the bottle touched my lips, I started panicking and tried to stop what I was doing but I couldn’t get my body to wake up and stop. Finally about 2 or 3 drinks in, my body broke free and I was able to move. I started crying uncontrollably and ran to the kitchen which was right next to me and shoved my finger down my throat and was able to throw it back up. My throat was on fire and I was just so scared and shaking uncontrollably. My mother heard me crying so she rushed into the kitchen and once I told her what happened, she didn’t really know what do but to offer that she take me to the hospital. I knew for sure I threw it all up, in contrast to how much I drank just then vs how much I threw up.. She stayed up with me until the morning to make sure I was okay and then I went back to sleep in the living room while she stayed up and kept an eye on me until I was rested. 

I was taking college classes at the time as part of a high school program and I had a psychology professor that I saw the next day so I thought I might ask her take on it. She said scientifically, the only explanation would be that I was thirsty and my sleep walking self went to get a drink. She said that’s all she could say from a scientific standpoint but that she’s never heard of anything like what I told her before and basically just be careful and to have someone near me when I’m sleeping for a little while just to be safe.

I know that was a little long but has anyone heard of or dealt with this kind of thing before? To this day it still scares the shit out of me. What if I try hurt myself or my fiancé one night while I’m sleeping? It’s just always at the back of my mind...",1
Sleep paralysis when sleeping alone,"I tend to get sleep paralysis when I’m sleeping alone (I work different different shifts than my partner every other month). It absolutely freaks me out and I focus all of my energy on rolling over or sitting up to wake up (it’s extremely hard to do). I don’t get weird visions or hallucinations at least, it’s mostly a feeling like a huge weight on me and breathing seems difficult. 

However, I’ve been trying to stay calm and to turn it into a lucid dream gateway but I can’t seem to stay calm enough because I want to wake myself up due to the sensation of feeling smothered. Any advice? 

If I become aware in dreams, I can normally become lucid but I can’t seem to use sleep paralysis as a way to do this because I’m so used to waking myself up when it happens.",1
Someone or something stepped on my Back,"I usually sleep at 1:30 AM, but I was falling sleep at 11 PM yesterday. First, I dreamt about watching some white worms on the ground outaide my house. I woke up and searched for that dream meaning... and there it is... Dreaming with a lot of worms means that  an intriguing person is putting to much attention on you.

Then, as usuaI, I was watching youtube videos to fall sleep... (It's very rare for me to fall sleep while laying upside down, but it happened) . Then the SP occurred:

.I was on my bed, on the same poaition I was sleeping, Dark room as always, very peacefull when suddenly felt something jumped at my BED (at this momment I knew I was dreaming beacause I have no pets at home) but... Maybe i forgot to close a window?... I tried to mové my legs to scare the damn whatever animal it was... But instead, it started to stomp my Back and making noises like somekind of demon or monter. FINALLY, that thing jumped through the wall and dissapearing instantly. I woke up,  Laying upside down without being  able to move my arms. I was feeling the pain of the stomps on my Back and having troubke to breathe

Now its 3:35 in Ecuador and I'm really nervous to sleep again. It's my first time dreaming somethin that scary that felt so Real.

My native language is Spanish.. Sorry for the big wrtiting mistakes.",1
My Army of Stuff Animals Doesn't Work Anymore,"A little context since I was in gradeschool I always sleep with a lot of stuff toys in my bed since I have re occuring nightmares of dying from an accident or someone killing me. Ever since then I always have a stuff animal to keep me company it sounds so childish but it help me through the years but this time it's different.

So for the past days I didn't sleep normally (i usually sleep at 11pm and wake up at 8 am) Trying to distract myself with games cause my dreams are getting worst recently. But tonight I decided to fix my messed up body clock and slept early. 

It's 3 in the morning here and I just woke up to the most messed up dream ever. My dream was just me staring into nothingness but then I felt like I can't breathe like I am drowning like someone is strangling me. I am literally in tears right now cause I dunno where to vent out. When I woke up from the nightmare it was just me strangling myself I was choking and already in tears. I can't control myself, I was literally strangling myself. I know I was hurting myself but I couldn't stop myself from doing it. It was like my hands were controlled by a different entity. Now my head hurts like hell from banging the headboard so that I would snapped out of it. I did snapped out of it. I feel so shitty and my neck hurts like hell and I'm afraid to go back to sleep now.",1
Yelling/screaming upon waking,"I'd like to apologize in advance. This post might jump around a bit. I'm kind of nervous posting here and if I let myself read this over, I'd probably wind up deleting everything and forego posting all together.

I've been dealing with SP for the past 7 or so years. And even after all this time, it's still such terrifying experience. I never thought to search for an online community or support group before. I'm honestly so glad there's a sub dedicated to SP. I've been reading through some of your posts and it's been helping me cope a lot. 

When you're experiencing an episode of SP, do you make those weird, muffled/choked sounds when you're scared? Like when you're trying to yell for help or scream in terror and the sound comes out all... distorted? That's what happens to me, and 9/10 times it leads to me actually yelling/screaming in real life once I'm physically able to do so (i.e. no longer paralyzed). 

Normally it's just screaming, but I've woken up a few times shouting ""fuck you"" at my SP demon (I'll admit that I find this a little funny to me when I fully wake up in the morning). Those are the times when I'm repeatedly saying it (or attempting to that is) during the episode and then I'm assuming I just actually yell it out once I'm able to.

Last night was a little different though. I had an SP episode and when I woke up I was yelling ""[partner's name], help."" I've honestly never done that before. 

Is this normal? Has anyone else experienced any of the stuff I mentioned above too? What do you do? Why does this happen? I'd just like to know that I'm not alone in this.

It terrifies my partner whenever it happens. They usually always comfort me, but I hate that I wake them.",1
Idk what the fuck happened,Ive had my share of nights with sleep paralysis so i usually break it pretty easily but last night as soon as i broke it i started floating and then got dropped down back to my bed and saw a black cloud with a face smile at me. And then after i got dropped down i got up from my bed i got slammed to the wall and then finally woke up like hours later but i swear that shit was to vivid to be a dream,1
Starting again,"So, this is story is a bit of journey but I really need to get it off my chest, also I'm on mobile so the format might be off for some of you. 

I started getting sleep paralysis when I was really young so they didnt used to bother me anymore or cause any kind of fear I'd more just watch them as I feel asleep, but after almost 5 years after not experiencing them they've started again. They used to all be of the tall man in my doorway reaching for me, but since I bought a salt lamp and left it on over night I haven't had any problems. 

At the start of the year the bulb in the lamp burned out and I've been too lazy/always forget to buy a replacement. 

Which leads to last night; this was new to me because it wasn't the tall man in my doorway but an even taller and lanky body, almost like a jack in the box, crouched by my side of the bed. Technically last night wasn't the first time I've seen this before, the last few nights I've seen its face, weirdly the face from the cover of the first purge movie but with giant white eyes with tiny black pupils, coming towards me when I'd close my eyes to try and sleep. Last night though it was true paralyse where I couldn't move and I was unable to scream as it was pulling me off the bed. 

The weird thing about its face is that my fiance, who also used to have sleep paralysis but hasn't for awhile now, has started having them again since the lamp burnt out. Her's recently have also been pop culture references; the old lady from the bathtub in the shinning and a real life version of krusty the clown from the Simpsons. Her krusty also tried pulling her off the bed which has never happened to her before either. Also worth noting is that our roommate has also started having sleep paralysis for the first time in her life this year.

Last night's episode has scared me so bad that I've moved an old bible to beside my bed as well as a rosary. Now this is a big thing for me since I dont go to church anymore because I found it hard to believe in the church growing up with gender identity issues and being pansexual, but these things still bring me some form of comfort and even though I understand the science behind sleep paralysis I still find it good to know I have something to defend myself from something that feels so demonic.",1
The Lanky Man,"***This is my first post in this subreddit, so please have some mercy on my soul.***  
***Also, English is not my mother tongue, but I will try my damnest to write comprehensible sentences.***

My story begins in 2014, the first time I discovered that I had to endure sleep paralyses. You probably should know that I always had problems falling asleep, most of the times I need up to atleast 1 1/2 - 2 hours laying still to finally doze off. I tried serveral ""cures"" to lessen this condition, so far nothing helped. These days I don't mind it, it's no big deal anymore because I learned how to live with it. But there is one happening I will never lay off, namely my first sleep paralysis.

I am almost 25 years old, 19 at the time this story takes place. Like always, I prepared to sleep by watching YouTube, and it just happened to be 1 AM in my country. I turned off my mobile phone, closed my eyes and did not move an inch (I hate moving around in bed and don't do it intuitively, so that's a given).

***That's where things went downhill.***

Something felt off. I was still awake, but I could not move my arms, legs and head. You get the idea. It seemed like I was fully functional mentally, but my body just shut down. At first, it was no big deal. Not being able to move while trying to do so sucks big time, but I wanted to sleep anyway so I couldn't care less. Hearing a sound that should not be audible however concerned me highly. I witnessed a rather metallic voice repeating ""Warum"" (German for ""why"") over and over again, getting faster as time went by. It was a little off, but my mind must have labeled it as being a dream so it wasn't that concerning to me.

***What happened next was more than concerning.***

There was a feeling I just wasn't able to leave behind. It gnawed at me, kept me alerted.The feeling of being observed by a stranger. I was terrified, being watched by others always startles me. Naturally, I had a room for myself by the time I turned nineteen, of course my twin sister could not share one with me at this age. But that in itself means there was no possibility someone, or rather something, was in my room. But there was. At first, I was not able to estimate the postion where that ""thing"" must have lingered, but it didn't take long for me to finally spot it. It was right next to me. Analyzed me with its big, empty eyes. Measured me with its long, bony fingers. That thing was huge, we are talking 6 feet 8 huge. It wasn't hostile at first, but it was **terrifying**. For more than half an hour (felt, wasn't exactly able to check the time) it just stared at me.

**Then it made it's move.**

The grotesque creature lunged at me, I was scared beyond recognition. The lanky man sat on my defenseless body, staring deliberately at my chest. Eerie sounds violated my mind (""Warumwarumwarumwarumwarum"") while I could do nothing to stop this twisted nightmare from happening. It felt like being eaten alive, it was damaging. I have seen my guts being ripped apart, albeit them being intact a few hours later.

**I woke up, but the fear remained.**",1
My last nightmare was on his phone,"I have been experiencing Sleep paralysis for some time now. Normally when I am frozen I can feel it like electricity throughout my body and very cold at the same time. Also when I get a visual hallucinations it’s normally grey ( like an overcast sky ) ghost or dark like a backlit figure.

This time it was a young man , he was sitting on the floor between my bed and my closet. There was light shining on him like he was in front of a screen and he had his head down.

It really looked like some guy was in my room looking at his phone. He saw me, looked startled for a second, and hopped on my bed rushed towards me to stare in my face. His movements were very cat like.

I screamed and woke up. I was feeling scared and very tired at the same time. Even tho the experience lasted a few seconds, and as I didn’t have time to try to move so I didn’t feel the electricity. 

I felt it might have been a vivid nightmare rather than SP and wasn’t sure I was awake.

I asked my kid if I screamed for real in my sleep the following day and was told I gasped. When I thought I shrieked.

TLDR my new entity possess modern technology and moves like a cat.",1
"Why do I get sleep paralysis when my dreams reach a certain level of complexity, ie. become meta?","It's mainly when the dream becomes meta in a way it seems dreams can't handle.

For example, in the dream, if I experience something or think about something that's related to metaphysics or supernatural stuff (like reincarnation), I IMMEDIATELY go into sleep paralysis mode.

Another example (which just happened to me, around half an hour ago) is if I experience something complicated. This dream was about a person who could draw with their mind; they just had to think, and that would be drawn. But if a thought wandered into their mind, which they didn't intend to think, that would appear in the drawing too. So, because of that, 4 huge elephants appeared in the sky inside that painting. It was such level of complication and meta-ness that the dream couldn't handle it and I got another SP.

Why does this always happen?

My sleep paralyses are scary. I'm immediately pulled out of the dream, have full awareness of what is going on, I cannot move at all, and I'm constantly being dragged into a hallucination which feels like being dragged into literal hell. I don't see monsters, I don't feel something sitting on my chest; it's just scary by itself.",1
